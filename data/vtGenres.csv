"2","768532","A CASE OF NERVOUS PROSTRA_TION RESULTING FROMINDIGESTION.itThey say that misery loves company, and they have1had it so often It has passed into a proverb. Yet itht isn't an all-round truth. Some kinds of misery detestit company. They want to be left alone. They hate to'0 be elbowed and questioned and talked to. A woundedF dog will always crawl Into some retired place by itself.is The instinct of badly injured men, after a battle, isy the same. Aliments that are nowsty fancy, tend to setk tongues wagging. But real, genuine, and dangerousn diseases don't incite to speech. Crises which are bige with fate usually come and go in quiet.Y That is why Mrs. Scuffham had no desire for theIs sooiety of even her best friends at a certain time she isa going to tell us about.pe ,Up to April, 1881,"" she writes, ""I never knew'ewhat it was to be ill. At that time I began to feel'n that something was amiss with me. I had no relishtfor my meals, and after eating my chest felt heavy andpainful, and my heart would beat and thump as though)r it meant to leap oat of its place. Presently I becamelo so swollen round the waist that I was obliged to unloose~1 1my clothing, as I couid not bear anything to touchr that part of my body,h E Even the lightest food gave me pain; a little fishIt setting my heart to beating at a great rate. My feetr were cold, and cold claimmy sweats would break outm. all over me, leaving mb exhausted and worn out. At's night I got no sleep to speak of, and in the morning Iit felt worse tired than when I went to bed. I alsoIs suffered a great deal from my feet being puffed up andsore. I could scarcely get about the house. When Its went shopping I had to ride to the town and back as Iit could only walk a few yards.al 'As time went on I lust my flesh and strength morely and more, and gave up hope of ever recovering the1Y precious health I had so sadly lost. I took medicines,Io and consulted a clever doctor at Derby, who examinedtoIn me and said my heart was weak. He also gave mea_ medicines, but I got only temporary ease from them,I andin a short time was as bad as before. All this timeis I was so nervous and depressed that 1 had no desirea_ for company. Onthe contrary, I seemed to want to bealone with my misery. Even a knock at the doorte frightened me, as though I expected bad news, yet Irsjedid not ready. My nerves and my fancies ran awayin with my knowledge and judgment. Thousands ofIn women who have suffered in this way will understandis what I mean.Isn; Year after year I remained in this condition, andre what I went through I cannot put in words, nor do Ir, wish to try. It will answer the purpose to say that 1Ie existed thus for eleven and a half years, as much deadas alive. I spent pounds on pounds in physic,but was not a whit the better for any of it.""' In October, 1892, a book was left at our house, ande_ I read in it of cases like mine being cured by Motherae Seigel's Syrup. I got a bottle from Mr. Bardill, thed. chemist, in Normanton Road, Derby, and when I had3l taken this medicine for a few days, my appetite wasrsie better and I had less pain. I kept on taking it, andd. soon my food agreed with me and I gained strength.of ""After this I never looked behind me, but steadilygot stronger and stronger. When I had taken three1, bottles I was quite like a new woman. All theLd nervousness had left me, and my heart was sound as ax. bell. Since then I have enjoyed good health, and allwf who knew me say my recovery is remarkable. I ams. confident that Mother Seigel's Syrup was the means,e_ in the hands of Providence, of saving my life; ande out of gratitude, and in hope of doing good, I freelyIn consent to the publication of this statement. (Signed)it (Mrs.) Ann Scuff lam, Cooper's Lane, Laceby, Grimsby,It May 1st, 1895.""Ss This letter is endorsed by Mr. William J. Tollerton,d of the same town, who vouches for the truth of whats. Mrs. Scuff ham has said, as he personally knew of theIt circumstances of her illness at the time they occurred.No comment can add a jot to the force of this open,ie candid, and sincere communication. Whosoever readsofit must needs be moved and convinced by it. Thei_ disease which filled this woman's life with pain andit misery for nearly twelve years was indigestion orr. dyspepsia, an ailment sly and cunning as a snake inr, the grass-and es dangerous. Send for the book ofd which Mrs. Scufiham speaks and road the symptomsd in order that you may know what it is, and how to l.h deal with it.

"10","214107","A MAIDEN'S TROUBLES. Miss Jamieson, a merry maiden, residing at Autumn-street, Ashby. Geelong, Vic, has had troubles of her own. 'They, are now past,' so she told an inquisitive reporter recently. 'Some few years ago,' she continued, 'I suffered from. a very severe attack of influenza.. I could never get rid of its after-effects until I tried Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People. Although generally experiencing robust health pre Was able to leave my room I was almost of ghostly proportions„ not at all like I am now. And I continued in this state for some time. I did not mind the weakness so much, feeling sure that would wear off in time with good nourishment. But in March of last year I commenced to experience gr,eat inconvenience from pains in my right siJe. I consulted- a medical man, who said that it was merely the after effects of the influenza, and I was not to worry myself. But as the pains continued, I did worry myself, and went ia Melbourne to consult a specialist. He informed me that it was partial paralysis. He put me through- a courseof treatment that left me as I was and I returned 'home fairly worn out. Whether the worry, or the heroic treatment I had undergone was responsible or not, I will not .venture an opinion up^bh, but a week at terwar-'-8 erysipelas set in- -on my face, and for weeks and months I suffered the greatest agony. In January a friend (a Miss Evans, of Eaglehawk, near Behdigo) came ? down to see me, -and -one- day she bought me a box. of Dr. Williams' Pink-Pills. When visiting Melbourne I. took- them, and four days afterwards' the pain commenced to *go away. I continued taking them for some time, and in all I used eight boxes, discontinuing them in August. From then until now I have not had the complaints that I had not been free from tot four years. I am 22 years of age. Scores know my sufferings, and7, the ' means ? of my recovery I am only too -pleased'- to supply.' 'Your friend, Miss Evans, must have felt very pleased with' the .result of Tffer. experiment.' 'Tes, it was the knowledge that a neighbor had received considerable benefit from the pills, in a very bad case of debility, that induced her to buy me the first box of Dr. Williams' Pink Pills.' 'One can scarcely realise the fact of your once resembling what the departed are credited with, Miss Jamieson.' 'No (laughingly), there is nothing ethereal about me nowJ 1 am nearer 12st than 9st. Yes, you can. include that, if you like,' and with a word of thanks tbe representative 'withdrew.

"47","149527","MR. CLEMENTS EXPLAINS, MANY people have expressed surprise that OLearNTS TonrO has met with such wonderful and unprecedented success in such a short time. The explanation is simple--IT Is GNUINE. I saw the thousands oat worthless hogeheads of American nostrums flooding the Auetralian market year by year, month by month, day by day, and knew that a great amount of money left these shores annually in return for these rubbishy articles, all of which made the country so much the poorer. I also knew that the exigencies of life in this country and the olimate necessitated the use of an artificial bloodmaker to restore the normal condition and vital forces which were so enervated by climatic and other influences. I also saw the thin, pale, delicate, and attenuated men and women of Australian cities, and studied the causes and ways and moans of remedying the evil; I saw that it was impossible to bring the article required into popular favour oexcept in the form of a patent medicine. I know of the thousands of pounds spent by the public annually in purchasing inert and sometimes harmful concections of worthless ingredients, and asked myself-Why can't we manufacture the article the public require, and make it of genuine and best materials, and give an article which wILL Do the good which' other makers only claim that theirs will do? I knew that such a remedy could be made, and that upless it met with publo approval, great lose must result. However, I determined to venture on its introduction, and thus OLBME?NTB TONIo came to be made, and in the short space of two years it has spread over the whole face of this continent. It is sold in every store in Australasia as freely as in Sydney; and the more fact of its enormous sale in this city is proof posibive of its virtues, for no article can command a great sale at the home of its birth unless it is absolutely and conclusively proved to be genuine. OLicesNTs TONIo has replaced every other article offered, and has the largest consumption tenfold of any other Australian medicine; and this is not due to the advertising expenditure of its proprietor, but to its pure, undisputed merit. Fellow Australians, we don't want the Yankee quack to dump. his shabip-loads of clap-trap fooleries and cure-alls on our Australian shores, and fool us with his smooth tongue and plausible humbug; neither do we want him to suck the vitality and marrow of our people with his consigumlents of cheomcal slope, which, with specious plauesibility, he guarantees to curo overything, from epilepsy to impecuniosity. We want a genuine article, made in our own land, by our own people, bought with our own money; then the money remains in our own country, and the country is so much the richer thereby, and we all have a chance of handling it again; whereas, if it once gets into the rapacious maw of the Yankee quack -farewell! it is gone for over. I know my article is genuine, and that it contains the material to make it cure disease where disease is curable. You may depend upon it that, if OCLEENTS To?Io fails, all others must fail. I can produce hundreds of proofs of the truth of my statemaents and the virtues of my remedy. F. M. OLuBsNce, Newtown, N,B.W. A","advertisement"

"63","577331","New York yes_terday at one o'clock. The steamer had the-flag of Fort Sumter flying from her niain_mast head, and a flag from Fort Moultriefrom her foremast. The Pawnee did notarrive at Charleston until after the surren_der. The fleet was rendered useless to FortSumter by a violent gale from the south_east. The following is the list of passen_gers :-Major Anderson, Captain Double_day, Captain Seymour, Lieutenants Davisand Hull of the artillery, Captain Fosterand Lieutenants Snyder and Meade of theengineer corps, Dr. Crawford, SergeantRancham and fifty-two men of Co. H, andSergeant Schribner and thirty men of Co.C ; also Miss Davis. Major Anderson land_ed at the Battery, and was received by animmense crowd. His carriage was sur_rounded by the people who expressed incheers ond other demonstrations their con_gratulations. He was followed by an im_mense throng through Broadway to theBrevoort House, where hlie joined his wife.The people endeavored to take the horsesof Major Anderson's carriage and drag himup Broadway, but his objections were re_garded. The following is a digest of Cap_tain Doubleday's statement:The demand to surrender Fort Sumterwas made on the 11th, and refused, not on_ly by Major Anderson, but as the unani_mous voice of his command. :On Fridaymorning at 3 o'clock, the rebels sent wordthat a lire would be opened in one hour,and at 4 o'clock the fire opened upon usfrom every direction, including the hidden_battery. The fire was opened with a volleyof seventeen mortars, firing ten-inch shellsand shot from thirty-three guns, mostlyColumbiads. We took breakfast, however,very leisurely. The command was dividedinto three watches, each under the direc_tion of two officers.After breakfast we immediately went tothe guns and opened fire on Fort Moultrie,Cumming's Point and Sullivan's Island.The iron battery of Cumnming's Point wasof immense strength, and most of our shotsglanced oftf Major Anderson refused toallow the men to work the guns.on the par_apet, on account of such a. terrific fire di_rected there. There is scarcely a roomleft in Fort Moultrie inhabitable. Severalshots went through the floating battery, butit was little damaged. Two guns on theiron battery were dismounted. A man wasstationed who cried "" shot"" or ""shell""when the rebels fired; the garrison was thusenabled to dodge them. At first the work_men were reluctant to help work the guns,but afterwards served most willingly andeffectively against the iron battery. Thebarracks caught fire several times on Fri_day, but were extinguished by the efforts ofMr. Hart of N. Y., and Mr. Lyman of Bal_timore, both volunteers. On Saturday theofficers' quarters caughlt fire from shell, andthe main gates were burnt; a magazine wassurrounded by fire, and ninety barrels ofpowder were thrown into the sea.When the magazine was encircled by fireall our materials were cut off, and we hadeaten our last biscuit two days before.The cartridge bags gave out. Five menwere employed to manufacture them out ofour shirts, sheets, blankets, :&c.It will take half a million dollars to re_pair Fort Sumter's interior. Most of theirshots were aimed at our flag.The following is the conversation whichoccurred between Anderson and Wigfall:The latter said, "" General Beauregard wish_es to stop this, sir.""Anderson only replied, "" Well, well.""Wigfall said, "" You have done all thatcan be done, and General Beauregard wish_es to know upon what terms you will evac_uate the fort.""Anderson :-"" General Beauregard is al_reaey acquainted with the terms.""Wigfall :-"" Do I undsrstand that youwill evacuate on the terms proposed ?""Anderson :-"" Yes, and only on those.""Wigfall then returned. Ten minutes af_ter Col. Chestnut .and others came fromBeauregard, asking if Anderson wanted anyhelp, and stating that Wigfiil had not seenBeauregard for two days, and had no author_ity for his demand on Anderson. To whichMajor Anderson replied, "" Then we havebeen sold. We will raise our flag again.""But they requested him to keep it downuntil communication could be had withBeauregard. Firing then ceased; and threehours after another deputation camne agree_ing to the terms previously decided upon.Pnort lrumtr hod not hboPn reinfotrort anany occasion.The Baltic arrived off Charleston on themorning of Friday, after the firing on fortSumter had begun. The Pawnee and Po_cahontas arrived next day. The Powhatanand Atlantic had not been seen. Duringall the while the fleet was off Charleston aheavy gale was blowing.Captain Fox had instructions to attemptto provision the fort, without troops, andif fired on, was to rush in the best way hecould; but the gale prevented the arrivalof the tugs and transports.The following is Major Anderson's dis_patch to the secretary of war :"" Sir, having defended fort Sumter untilour quarters were entirely burned, the maingates destroyed by fire, the gorge wall se_riously injured, the magazine surroundedby flames and its door closed from the ef_fects of heat, and three cartridges of pow_der only bein;g available, and no provisionsbut pork remaining. I accepted the termsof evacuation offered by General Beaure_gard, being the same offered by him on the11th inst., prior to the commencement ofhostilities, and marched out of the fort onSunday afternoon, 14th inst., with colorsflying and drumns beating, bringing awaynamy company and our private property, andsaluting my flag with fifty guns.OERToc ANDERSON,Major First Artillery.""Mlajor Anderson's reception in New York","news"

If I say your Majesty does not aipprove ofyour Government continuing in the path it haschosen ot further extending its rigorous measures againstthe religion of Jesus Christ, whereby the latter is mostinjuriously affected, will your Majesty then not becomeconvinced that these measures have no other effect thanthat of undermining your Majesty's own throne. I speakwith frankness, for my 'banner is truth.

"" PlO.,,THE REPLY OF THE EMPEROR.His Majesty the Emperor replied as followsaBerlin, September 3rd, 1873.I I'm glad that your Holiness has, aS in former times,done me the horour to write to lie. I rejoice the moreat this, since an opportunity is thereby afforded in ofcorrecting errors which, as aSpears from the contents ofthe letter of your Holiness of the 7th August, mtst havenocurred in the communication you have received relativeto the Gelman affairs. If the reports vwhich are madeto your Holiness lrespecting German pusstions onlystated the truth, it would not be possible for your Holi_ness to entertain the supposition that my Governmententers irpon a path which I donot approve. Accordingtothe Constitution of my States, such a ease cannot happen,since the laws and Government measures in Prussia re_,luire my consent as Sovereign. To my deep sorrow, aportion of my Catholic subjects have organised for thepast two years a political *party which endeavoursto disturb by. intrigues hostile to the State, the religiousmace which lais existed in Prussla for centuries.Leading Catholic priests have unfortunately not only ap_proverl this movement but joined in it to the extent ofopen revolt against existing laws. ft will not have escapedthe observation of your Holiness that similar indicationsmanifest themselves at the present time in several Euro_pean, and in some transatlantiefStates. It is not my missionto investigate the causes by which tbeclergy andthe faithfulof one of the Christian denominations can be inducedactively to assist the enemies of all law; but it certainlyis my mission to protect international peace, and preservethe authority of the laws in the States whose governmenthas been entrusted to me by God. I am conscious that Iowe hereafter an account of the accomplishment of this, mykingly duty. I should maintain order and law in my Statesagainst all attacks, as long as God gives me the power.I am in duty bound to de it, as a' Christian monarch, evenwhen, to my sorrow, I have to fulfil this Royal dutyagainst servants of a Church which I suppose acknow_ledges, no less than the Evangelical Church, that thecommandment of obedieuce to secular authority is anemanation of the revealed will of God. Many of the par_tics in kPrussia subject to your Holiness ' disown,'to my resret,'the Christian doctrine in this respect, andplace myGovernment under the necessity, supported by thegreat majority of my loyal Catholic and Evangelical sub_jects, of extorting obedience to the laws by worldlymeans._ I wvillingly entertain the hope that yourHoliness, upol being inf1rmed of the true positionof affairs, will use your authority to nut an endto the agitation carried on amid deplorable distortionof the truth and abuse of priestly authority. The religionof Jesus Christ has, as I attest to your Holiness before God,nothing to dowith these intrigue any more than has truthtowhose banner, invoked by your Holiness, I uardservedlysubscribe. There is one more expression in the letter ofyour Holiness which I cannot pass over without con_fradiction, . although it is not based upon the pre_vious information, but upon the belief of yourHoliness-namely, the expression that every one that hasreceived baptism belongs to the Pope. The evangelicalcreed, which, as must be known to your Holiness, I, likemy ancestors and the majority of my subjects profess,does not permit us to ascept in our relation to God anyothernmediatorthan our Lord Jesus Christ. The differ_ence of belief does not prevent me from living in peacewith those who -do not share mine, and offering yourHoliness the expression of my personal devotion andesteem.-I, &c,,""(Signed) "" WILLIM.""FRANCE.THE TRIAL","news"

"90","867378","WVASHIINGTON, Mlarch 4.-After tie, oath of of_lice was administered by Justice Fuller to-day.President Harrison read his address in a loudand distinct tone. Th11 rain was falling heavilyand an umbrella was held over his head while heread. Applause was frequent. The address isas follows:There is no constitutional or legal requirementthat a Presilnt shall take the oath of ofilcein the presence of the people, but there is amanifest appropriateness in a public Induc.tlon to oli0ce of the Chief Executive Officerof a nation. From the beginning of ourGovernment the people to whose service an of.ilcial oath consecrates the officer, have beencalled to witness the solemn cereolmonlal. Auoath taken in the presence of the people becomesa mutual covenant, The officer covenants toserve tile whole body of the people by the faith.fIl execution of the laws, so that they may be theunfailing defense and the. scourity of those whorespect and observe them, and that neitherwealth, station nor power of combinations shallbe able to evade these Just penalties or to wrestthem from a beneliceut publIc with a purpose tocerve the ends of cruelty or of sellishness. Mypromise is spoken., Yours Is ullspoken but notless real and solemn.AN INVOCATION.The people of every State have here their rep.resentatives, and surely I do not misinterpretthe spirit of the occasion when I assume thatthe whole body of the people covenant with meand with each other to-day to support and de_(lend the Constitution of the union of the States,to yield a willing obedience to all laws, and eachto every other citizen his equal civil and politicalrights. Entering thus solemnly into covenantwith each other, we may reverently invoke andconfidently expect the favor and help of Al_mlglhty God, that he will give to 10e wisdom,smreneth ana Ildelity, and to our people the spiritof fraternlly alnt the love of righteousness andpeace.THE CONSTITUTIONAL CENTENNIALThis occasion derives peculiar interest fromthe fact that the Presidential term which beginsat this date is tihe twenty-sixth under our Con_stitution. The first Inauguration of PresidentWashington took place in New York, where Con.gress was tholl sltting. on the 30th day of Adril,1789, having been deterred by reason of delaysattending the orgauization of Congress. Ourpeople have already wortllily observed the cou_tennials of independence, of the battle of York_town and of the adoption of the Constitution,and will shortly celebrate In Noew York the lusti_tullon of tihe second great department of ourconstitutional schelme of government, Whenthe centennial of the institutlon of the JutlicialDeparltnert by the organization of the SupremeCourt shall have been suitably observed, as IJrust it will be, our nation will have fully enteredits second century,A CONTRAST WViTIT THE PAST.I will not attempt to note the marvelous and ingreat part the happy contrasts between our counatry, as It steps over tile threshold into its secondcentury of organized existence under tire Consti_tuteon, and that weak but wisely ordered youngnation that looked untauntedly down the firstcentury when all its years stretched out beforeit. Our people will not fall at this time to recallthe incidents which accompanied tile institutionof government under the Constitution and findinspired Ciuldauce in the teachings and exampleof Washington and his great associates and hopeand courage in the contrast which the thirty_eight populorus and prosperous States ofler to tiethirteen States, weak In everything except cour_age and love of liberty, that then fringed our At_lanlle seaboard. The territory of Dakota'spopulation is greater than any of toe originalStates, except Virginia, and greater than tihe ag_gregate of live smaller states in 1790.THE GnROWTHr WESTWARD;The center of population when our National ofCapital was located was east of Baltimore. It ofwas argued by many well-llformed persons that it;It would move eastward rather tian westward, arYet in 1880 it was found to be near Cincinnati, aind trthe new census;ahout to be taken will show an. atother stride to the westward, and that which was 1Otile lody Iles come to be only the rich fringe of[ (the ltllon's robe. But our growth has not been oflimited to teriltory, population and aggregate Pwealth, Itarvelous as it has been in each of[these directions. The masses of our Ptpeople are better fed, clothed and housed lthian their fathers were: facilitiesfor popular education has been vastly enlarged rand more generally diflused; the virtues of cour_ 0oage and patriotism have given recentprooofof retheir continued presence and increasing power in Utihe hearts and over the lives of our peopleo; the sIinilnences ol religlon have been multiplied and Pstrengthened; the sweet offices of charity have higreatly increased and the virtue of temperance a;is held In higher estimation, Wlohavo not at_ atalined an ideal Constitutlon, Not all of our peoe_ iple are happy and prosperous; not all of themare virtuous and law-abiding; but on the wholethe opportunities offered to individuals to securethe comforts of life are better than are foundeClewbere and largelybetter tlbautiley were here aone hundred years ago, 0I'TOTECTION SEED, IThe surrender in a large measure of the soy_ IOreiglty of the General Government affected by othie adoption of the Constitution was not accom. Pplished until suggestions of reason were strongly creiforced by tirhe more illperative voice of expe_leree. Dilvergent interests and those of peacespeolly ldemanll ded a more erft[ect union, Thil 1emerchant, slllip-naster and Inanufacturer discov_ered and disclosed to our statesmen and to ourrpeople that commercial emancilpation must beadded to tile political freedom which flad been so Tbravely woo. The colnmmetrcal policy of tie cmotlher country bad not relaxed any of itsIlar and oppressive features. To hold incheek the development of our commercirnlrtirrine, to prevent or retard the establishmentand growthl of manufactures in States, and so tosecure all Ae) lecan market for their shops andcarnyinF trade for their ships, was the policy ofEuroirean statesmen arind was pursued with themost sellish vigor, Petitions poured upon Con_gross urging the imposition of discriminatingduties that shlould enrourage the production ofneeded things at home. The patriotism of peoplewhichl no lolrer foutnd a field for exercise Itn war,was energetically directed to tie dullty of equip_ping the young ltepublic for defense of its iode_penenceo by matking its people self-dependentand socleties for tile promotion of ho1me Inanu-tfactures and for encouraging the use of domes_ties in thie dress of the people were organized inmany of tIhe States,LIVING PRINCIPLES OF PROTECTION.Tihe revival at the end of the century of thesame patriotic interest in the preservation anddevelopment of domestic industries and the de_fense cf our working people against injuriousforeign competition, is an Iaeldent worthy of at_tention. It is lot a departure, but a return thatwe witness. The protective policy had then Itsopponents. Tile argument was made, as now,that its benelits inured to particular classes orsections,. If the question became, in any sense,or at any time, sectional, it was only becauseslavery existed in some of the States, but for thisthere was no reason why tile cotton-producingStates shlould not have led or walked with theNew England States in the production of cottonfabrics, There was tinls reason only Wly theStates that divide with Penusvivanla the mineraltreasures of great southeastern and centralmoutaill ranges should have been so tardy intbringirg to the slicltil)g furnace and to the millthe coal and iron from the near hillsides.T1031E PIRODUrCT'ION TIIE DEATII OF SLAVERY.Tie mill tires were lighted at the funeral pyreof slavery and the Emancipation Proclamationwas heard in the depth of the earth as well as inthe shy and men were made free and materialthings becanme out servants and the sectionalelement happily has been eliminated from theTariff discussion and we have no longer Statesthat are necessarily planting States: none are ex_clude( fronm acllieving that diverslication of put'_suits among people which brings wealth andcontentment. The cotton plantationr will not beless valuable when the product is spun fin thecountry town by operatives whose necessitiescall for diversiflled crops and create a home de_mend for garden and agricultural products,Every new riune, furnace and factory Is an ex_tension of the productive capacity of a Statenmore real and valuable than added territory.e IDENTITY OF INTERESTS.Shall prejudices and the paralysis of slaverycontinue to hang upon the stairs of progress?flow long will those who rejoice that slavery nolonger exists chletish or tolerate the incapacitiesSit put upon their communities, look hopefully tot the continaance of our protective system, and tothe consequent development of manutactnringe and inallig enterprises to States hitherto whollyg' rin gto a8ricuture,as a potent influence in thepeartfet unileationel our people?uen who havef eltthebenetto[ their noighlborliood and mens who v ork in the shop or tUle field will not fail totrod aud to defend a commilunitry of in_teres!. Is It not quite posslhie that tihefarmers ned the promoters of the great rain_mi e and manufacturii c enterprises wolch have' recently beten establltlle in the South mary yetl find that t!he free ballot or teo workingnen,r wilinomt dllstinction of race, is needed for tleiriL detense as wel. as their own? I do not doubtp that iIt tlhose uen in the Soulth wileo now acceptthe tatliF views of Cly and the conustitluonualexpositions of:Webster would couragilously avowand defend Welr real couvictlotls, they wouldnot uind it dilllicult by friendly instruction tomake tile black lan their elllhient and sale ally,if 110ot only in establishlng correct lriunelples inour national adlnihstratlon, but iu preservinlfor tholer local comnunmtles the beoneilts of socialorder and honest government, at least Ullil tilegood ollices of kindness and education have beenfailly tried. A contrary conclusion cannot beplausibly urged.SPECIAL LEGISLATION CONDEMNED,I have altogether rejected the sutgestion of aspecial Executive policy for any section of ourcountry. It is the duty of the Executive to ad_milnister and enforce In methods and instrumuen_talities pointed out and provided by the Consti_tution, all the laws enacted by Congress. Theselaws are general and their administration shouldbe uniform and equal. As a citizen ml:ty notelect which he will enforce the duty to obey andtoexecute embraces the Constitution in its en_tirety and tile whole code of laws enacted tunderIt,THE EVILS OF OVERI{IDINGt LAWh.The evil exallple of pormitting individuals,corporations or eomumulties to nullify laws, be_cause they cross some selfish or local Interestsor prejudices, is full of danger, not only to thenation at large but nluch more to those who usetins pernicious expedient to escape their justobligations, or to obtain unjust advantarge overothers. They will presently thtemselves be coin_pielled to appeal to tihe law for protection, andthoso who would uso the lawa as a defenso lustnot leny the use of it to others. if gre it cor_poratitons woidtl be more sciupiulouts to observetheir legal limitations and dtlles, they would haveless cause to cotnplain of thei'r r'iets or of vio_Init interferenecs with tileir operations. Aconmunuity tlat by concert, open or secret,alonOg its oltltzone, denies to a portion of itsmensmbers their plain rl'ltis ieder the law, iiassevered the only safe bond of social order antIprosperity, The evil works from a b:ad centerboll ways. It delnoralizies those who practiceit and destroys the faih of those who suffer in it,Incllicleney of law as a safe i)rotection to man Inwllose breast that faill has been dalkened Isnalturally the sulbject of dangerous and uincannysuggestions.THIE NE'GISSITY OF OBSERYVNG LAWS.Those who use unlawful methods, it moved byno higher motive thai the selllfishness thatpreompted them, may well stop and inquire wihatis to be the entd of this? Au unlawful expedientcannot become a permanent condition of govern_weLt. If educated ant\ illhlentala classes In thecountulnity elllier practice or connive at a sys_tematic violation of those laws that seem to thcemto cross their convenience, what can they tx_pect? The lesson that special or supposed classinterest is a sulliclent cause for ixwlessness hlasbeen well learnled by ignorant classes. A cam_munity where te law is a rule of conduct andwhiere the courts, not mobs, execute its penallles,is the only attractive field for business invest_ments and honest labor,KATUIALIZAT ION LAWS SHOULD liEt AMENDED.Our Naturalization laws should be so amendedas to make the inquiry into the character andgood disposition of persons applying for citizen_ship more careful and searchlng. Our existiuglaws have been in their adminilstrationu unin_pressive, and often in an unintelligible farm,We accept amnan as a eltizen without the knowl_edge of his litness tand 11e assumes theduties of citizeusllip wlthlout tile knowt_eote of what are rte privileges of Americanlctizensthlland a good knowledge by him of Itsinstitutions. We should not cease to be hos_pitable to iminlgration, but we should cease tobe careless as to the character of it. There arelenl of all races, even the best, whose cominngnecessarily burden our public revenues orthreaten social order, These should be identi_lied and excluded.TIlE MIONROE DOCTRINE.We have happily maintained the policy ofavoiding Interference with European affitrs, andhave been only Interested spectators of theirconventions in diplomacy and always ready touse our friendly ollices to promote peace, butnever obtruding our advice and never attempt_ing unfairly to coin the distresses of otherpowers into commercial advantage, We havea just rilht to expect our Eoropean policy willbe the American policy of European courts, Itis manulestly so incompatible with those pre_cautious for our peace and safety which thegreat powers habitually observe and enforce Inmatters atieetiig them, that a shorter water_way between our Eastern and Western sea_boards should be dominated by any EuropeanGovernment. What we may confidently expectIs that such a purpose will not be entertained byany friendly power. We shall in future,as inthe past, use every endeavor to maiutatu andenlarge our friendly relations with tilegreat powers, but they will not expectus to look kindly upon any project that wouldleave us subject to dangers hostile 111 observa_tion or environment. We have not sought todominate or absorb any of our weaker neigh_bors, but rather to aid and encoulage them toestablish free and stable governments, restingupon tie consent of their people, We have aclear right to expect therefore that no Europeangovernment will seek to establish colonial de_pendencles upon the territory of these depend_ent American States. That which a sense ofjustice refrains us from seeking, they may bereasonably williug to forego. It must not be as_sulled, however, that our interests are so ex_clusively American that our entire attention toany events that mnay transpire elsewhere can betaken for granted. Our citizens, domiciled forpurposes of trade in all countries and at manyof the islands of the sea, demand and will haveour adequate care in their personal and commer_cial rights.MAINTENANCE OF OUR P.ICIITS.The necessities of our navy require convenientcoaling stations and dock and harbor privileges.These and other trading privileges we will feelfree to obtain only by means that do not ill anydecree partake of coercion, however feeble theGovernment from which we ask such coUCes_stons; but having fairly obtained them by ineth_ods and for purposes entirely consistent, with amost friendly disposition toward all otherPowers, our consent will be necessary to anymloiilcation or impairment of concession, Weshall neither fall to respect the flag of any friend_ly natlion or the just right of its citizens nor toexact like treatment of our own, Calilness, jus_tice and consideration should characterize ourdiplomacy. The ollices of an intelligent or offriendly arbitration In proper cases should be ad_equate to the peaceful adjustment of all iuterrnatlonal diflliculties, By such methods we willmake our contribution to the world's peace,which no natlon values more highly, and avoidthe opprobrium which must fall upon a nationthat luthlessly breaks it.The duty devolved by law upon the Presidentto nominalte and by and with the advice and con_sent of the Senate to appoint all public officerswhose appointment is not otherwise provided forin the Constitution or by Act of Congress, illsbecome very burdensome and its wise and elii_cleutdischargefull of oliculty, Thecivtlltstissolarge that personal knowlede of any large nuln_her of applicants Is Impossible. The Presidentmust rely upon the representations of other,and these are often made inconsiderately andwithout any just sense of responsibility,I have the right, I think, to insist thatthose who volunteer or are Invited to giveadvice as to appointments shall exercise consid_eration and ildelity. A high sense of duty andan ambition to improve the service should char_acterize all public ofllicers. There are many waysin whichl the convenience and comfort of thosewho have business with our public offlers maybe promoted by thoughtful and obliging ofilcers,and 1 shall expect those whom I may aupoint tojustily their election by conspicuous eflliciency Inthe discharge of their duties, Honoraole partyservice will certainly not be esteemed by me adllqualifleatlon of public ollice, but it will in nocase be allowed to serve as a shieldof ofllicial negligence, Incompetencyor de linquency. It is entirely cred_itable to sek p1)ublic oiflce by proper methodsand proper motives, and all auppileats will betreated with consideration, but I shall needand ihe heads of thedepartments will need timefor inquiry au odellberatlion. Persistent 11a_portaulty will uot, therefore, be the best supportof an application for office. Tile Ileads of de_parltients,tbiureaus and all other public olleceshavinlg any duty connected therewith will be ex_pected to enforce the Civil Service law fully andwithout evasion. Beyond this obvious duty Ihope to do something more to advance tilerelorma of Civil Service. The ideal, or even myown ideal, I shall propably not attain. Theretrospect will form a basis of judgment morethan promises. We shall not, however, I amlsure, Ds able to put our Civil Service upon a nonpartisan basis until we have secured an Ineu1m_hency that fair-llinded men of tile opposition willapprove for impartiality and integrity. As thenumber of such in the civil list increase renlovalsfroml olice will diminish,MiEANS OF IRDUCINO THIE BUITPLUS.While a Treasury surplus is not the greatestevil, It is a serious evil, Our revenue should beample to meet the ordinary annual demands uponour Treasury with a suflielenlt margin for thoseextraordinary but scarcely less ininerative de.mands which arise now aud then, The expendli_Lures should always lie made with economy andonly upon public necessity. Wastefulness,prolilgacy or favoritism in public expenditure, iscriminal; but there is nothlbing in the condition ofour country or our people to suggestthat anything necessary to the publteprosperity, security or honor should be undulyposiponedi, It will be the duty of Congresswholly to forecast and estimate the extraordinarydlemauns, having added them to our ordinary ex_penditures; to adjust our revenue laws that nocousiderable anunal surplus will remain. Wewill fortunately be able to apply to the redemp_tion of the public debt any small and unforseeolexcess ot revenue. This is better thatj to reduceour income below our expenditures with the re_suiting choice between another change of ourIRevenue laws and an increase of the public debt,It is posible, I am sure, to effect the necessaryreduction of our revenues without breaking downthe Protective Tariff or seriously injuring allydomestic industry.MORE WAR VESSELS NEEDED,The construction of a sulfficient number of mod_ern war-ships, with their necessary armament,should progress rapidly, and as is consistentwith care and perfection in the plans and work_manship, The spirit, courage and skill of ournaval oflicers and seamen have many times iaour history given to weak ships and loectletentguns a rating greatly beyond that of the navallist, that they will again do so upon occasion,I do not doubt they ought not by promeditationor neglect to be left to the risks and exlgenieesof an unequal combat.COMMERCIAL STEAMSHIP LINES,We should encourage the establishment ofAmerican steamship lines. The exchanges ofcommerce demand stated, reliable and rapidmeans of communication. and until these areprovided the development of our trade withstates lying south of us is impossible,Our pension laws should give more adequateand discrimlnating relief to Union soldiers andsailors and to their widows and orphans, Sucr:occasions as this should remind us that we oweeverything to their valor andt sacrlilccs, Tills isa subject for congratulation,THE NEW STATES.There is a near prospect of tile admission intotihe Union of Dakota and Montana and Washing_ton 'l'erritories, The act of justice has been un.reasonably delayed in the ease of some of them.The people who have settled these Tertritoriesare Intelligent, enterprising and natriotie, andthe accession of these new States will addstrength to the nation. It is due to the settlersin these Ten itorles who have availed themselvesof the Invitations of our land laws to makehomes on the publPc domain, that their titles bespeedily adjusted and tlleir honest entries con_firmed by patent.It is gratiiying to observe the general interestbeing manifested to reform our election laws,Those who have been for years calling attentionto the pressing necessity of throwing about tilheballot and about elections greater safe-guards inorder that our elections might not only be freeand pure, but might clearly appear to be so, wel_come the accession of any who did not so soonseem to discover the need of it.FREEDOM OF TIlE P,ALLOT.The Reform National Congress has not as yettaken control of elections in that case overwhich the Constitution gives its jurisdiction, buthas accepted and adopted the election laws forthe several States, provided penalties for theirviolation and methods of supervision and only theinefficiency of the State laws or any unfair par_tisan admistration of them could suggest a de_parture from this policy. It was clearly, how_ever, in the contemplation of the framers of theConstitutton that on exigency might arise andprovision was wisely made for it, The freedomnf the ballot is a condit ion of our national life, andno power vested in Congress or in the Executiveto.secure or perpetuate it should remain unusedupon occasions. Tile people of all the Con_gressional uistricts have an equal interest thatelections in each shall truly express the viewsand wishes of the majlrity of qualilliedelectors residing in It. The results ofsuch elections are not local, and an iusistence oflectlors residing in otllr distriets that they shallit be pure and free does not savor at all of hnperti_neece, If In any tate tie public security istllought to be threatened by ignoranceamong electors, thile obvious rernemly is education.The sympathy and the help of our people willnot be withheld front ary commutity strugglingwith special embarassment or flilllnltics con_ected withll the sultfrage, if the remedles pro_posed proceed upon lawitll lines and are pro_lntoted by Just and honorable methods. HIow shallthose who prallice election frauds receive thatrespect for the sanctity of the ballot whichl is tilefirst conldilion and obliatlion of good citizenship?The nmin who has comlie to regard the ballot-boxas a juggle l's lat hlas renounced his allegiance,A io01 PLANE FOR PATRIOTISM.,Let us exalt patriotisn and moderate our partycoultentlons; let those who would die for the flagof battle give a better proof of their patriotismlalid higher glory to their country by pro_mloting fraternity and justice,. arty suc_cess that is achleved by nlfair mnuthods orby practices partaklng of revolution Is hurtfulant evanescent, even irorll a party stltndrpOilrt.We should hold our differltg opinlous in miuturrrespect, alid ihavilnr sublmitted thlon to the arbI_tration of the ballot should accept an anl_vr-rse jllrlmenlt withl the respect that wewould have deinatded of our oplponents if thedecislon lhad been In our favor, No otherpeople have a government more worthy of theirrespect anod love, or a land so mlagollicent in ex_tent, so pleasant to look upon, so full of generoussuggestnuu to enterprise and laba,r, God hasplaced upon our head a diaetmn and has laid atour feet wealth beyond dellnitllou or calculation,but we hrsot rott forget that we these gilts ulponcociulion that justice anmldmercy shlall holdr theleils of lower and that tile upward avenuesof hope shall be free to all eople. I do rnot uits.bLust a failure, Dangers have been in frequentambush along our pathi, but we have uncoveredand vanqulishsed themi all.

Yesterday at one o'clockthe enemy, taking advantage of a terriblestorm, which had flooded the valley of theChickahominy; attacked our troops on theright flank. Gen. Casey's division, whichwas in the first line, gave way unaccounta_bly and disunitedly. This caused a confu_sion, during which the guns and baggagewere lost, but Generals H-eintzleman andKearney most gallantly brought up theirtroops, which checked the enemy. At thesame time, however, we succeeded by greatexertion in bringing across Generals Sedg_wick and Richardson's divisions, who droveback the enemy, covering the ground withhis dead. This morning the enemy attempt_ed to renew the conflict, but was everywhererepulsed. We have taken many prisoners,among whom are Gen. Pettigrew and Col.Long. Our loss is heavy, but that of theenemy must be enormous. With the ex_ception of General Casey's division, themen behaved splendidly.

more touching than to behold soft andmale who had been all weakness and dependence and alive to every trivial roughness while treading the prosperous paths of life suddenly rising in mental force to be the comforter and supporter of her husband under misfortune and abi ding with unshrinking firmness the bitterest blasts of adversity As the vine which has long twined its graceful foliage around the oak had been lifted by it into sunshine will when the hardy plant is rifted 1 by the thunderbolt cling round it with its caressing tendrils and bind up its shattered boughs so is it beautifully ordered by Providence that woman who is the mere dependent and ornament of man in his happier hours should he his stay and solace when smitten with sudden calamity winding herself into the rug ged recesses oi his nature tenderly supporting the drooping head and binding up the broken heart was once congratulating friend who had around him blooming knit together in the strongest 1 can wish you no better lot '1 said he with enthusiasm than to have wife and children if you are prosperous they are to share your prosperity if otherwise there they are to comfort you And indeed have observed that married men falling into misfortune are more apt to retrieve their situation in the world than single men partly because they are more stimulated to exertion by the necessities of the helpless and beloved beings who depend upon them for subsistence but because their spirits are soothed and relieved by domestic endearments and their self-respect kept alive by finding that though all abroad is darkness and humiliation yet there is still little world of love of which they are monarchs Whereas single man is apt to run to waste and self- neglect to fancy himself lonely and abandoned and his heart to fall into ruin like some deserted for want of an inhabitantThese observations call to mind little domestic story ot' which was once witness My intimate friend Leslie had married beautiful and accomplished girl who had been brought in the midst of fashionable life She had it is true no fortune but that of my friend was ample and he delighted in the anticipation of indulging her in every elegant pursuit and administering to those delicate tastes and fancies that spread kind of witchery about the sex aller lif v' said he shall be like fairy ale The very difference in their characters produced harmonious combination he was of romantic and somewhat serious cast she was all life and gladness 1 have often noticed the mute rapture with which he would gaze upon herin company of which her sprightly powers made her the delight and how in the midst of applause her eye would still turn to him as if there alone she sought favour and acceptance When leaning on his arm her slender form contrasted finely with his tall manly person Tne fond confiding air with which she looked up to him seemed to call forth of triumphant pride and cherishing tenderness as if he on his lovely burthen for its very helplessness Never did couple set forward on the path of early and well-suited marriage with fairer prospect of felicity It was the mishap of my friend however to have embarked his fortune in large speculations and he had not been married many months when by succession of sudden disasters it was swept from him and he found himself reduced almost to penury For time he kept his situation to himself and went about with haggard countenance and breaking heart His life was but protracted agony and what rendered it more insupportable was the necessity of keeping up smile in the presence of his wife for he could not brim himself to overwhelm herwith the news She saw however with the quick eves of affection that all was not weil with him She marked his altered looks and stifled sighs and was not to he deceived by his sickly and vapid attempts at cheerfulness She tasked all her sprightly powers and tender to win him hack to happiness but she only drove the arrow deeper into his soul The more he saw cause to love her the more torturing was the thought that he was soon to make her wretched little while thought he and the smile will vanish from that cheek the song will die away from those lips- the of those eyes will be with sorrow and the happy heart which now beats lightly in that bosom will be weighed down like mine by the cares and miseries of the world At length he came to me one dav and related his whole situation in tone of the deepest despair When had heard him through inquired does your wife know all this T- At the question ho burst into an agony of tears For God's sake cried he if you have any pity on me don't mention mv wife it is the thought of her that drives me almost to madness And why not said She must know it sooner or later you cannot keep it long from her and the intelligence may break upon her in 1 more startling manner than if imparted bv yourself for the accents jot those we love soften the harshest tidings Besides you are depriving yourself of the comforts of her sympathy and not merely that but also endangering the only bond that can keep hearts together an unreserved community of thought and feeling She ill soon perceive that something is secretly preying upon your mind and true love will not brook reserve but feels undervalued and outraged when even the sorI rows of those it loves are concealed from it 4k Oh but mv friend to thinkwhat blow 1 am to give all her future prospects how 1 am to strike her very soul to the earth by telling her that her is beggar that she is to forego all the elegancies of life all the pleasures of society to shrink with me into indigence and obscurity To tell her that 1 have dragged her down from the sphere in which she might have continued to move in constant brightness the light of every eye-- the admiration of every heart How can she bear poverty she has been brought up io all the refinements of opulence How can she bear neglect she has been the idol of society Oh it will break her heart it will break her heart saw his grief was eloquent and let it have its flow for sorrow relieves itself by words When his paroxysm had subsided and he had relapsed into moody silence resumed the subject gently and urged him to break his situation at once to his wife He shook his head mournfully but positively But how arc you to keep it from nor It is necessary she should know it that you may take the proper to the alteration of your circumstances You must change your style of living- nay observing pans to pass across his countenance don't let that afflict

transport of grief and tenderness And believe me my friend said stepping up and grasping him warmly by the hand believe me she can be the same with you Aye more it will be source ofpride and triumph to her it will call forth all the Intent energies and fervent sympathies of her nature for she will rejoice to prove that she loves you for yourself There is in every true woman s heart spark of heavenly fire which lies dormant in the broad daylight of prosperity but which kindles up and beams and blazes in the dark hour of adversity No man knows what the wife of his bosom is no man knows what ministering angel she is until he has gone with her through the fiery trials of this world There was something in the earnestness of my manner and the figurative style of my language that caught the excited imagination of Leslie knew the auditor 1 had to deal with and following up the impression had made 1 finished by persuading him to go home and unburden his sad heart to his wife must confess notwithstanding all had said felt some little solicitude for the result Who can calculate on the fortitude of one whose whole life has been round of pleasure Her gay spirits might revolt at the dark downward path of low humility suddenly pointed out before her and might cling to the sunny regions in which they had hitherto revelled Besides ruin in fashionable life is accompanied by so many galling mortifications to which in other ranks it is stranger In short 1 could not meet Leslie the next morning without trepidation He had made the disclosure And how did she bear it Like an angel It seemed rather to be relief to her mind for she threw her arms around my neck and asked if this was all that had made me unhappy- but poor girl added he she cannot realize the change we must undergo She has no idea of poverty but in the abstract she has only read of it in poetry where it is allied to love She feels as yet no privation she experiences no want of accustomed conveniences or elegancies When we cometo experience its sordid cares its paltry wants its petty humiliations -then will be the real trial But said now that you have got over the severest task that of breaking it to her the sooner you let the world into the secret the better The disclosure may be mortifying but then it is single misery and soon over whereas you otherwise suffer it in anticipation every hour in the day It is not poverty so much as pretence that harasses ruined man the struggle between proud mind and an empty purse the keeping up hollow show that must soon come to an end Have the courage to appear poor and you disarm poverty of its sharpest sting '1 On this point found Leslie perfectly prepared He had no false pride himself and as to his wife she was only anxious to conform to their altered fortunes Some days afterwards he called upon me in the evening He had disposed of his dwelling-house and taken small cottage in the country few miles from town He had been busied all day in sending out furniture The new establishment required few articles and those of the All the splendid furniture of his late residence had been sold excepting his wife s harp That he said was too closely associated with the idea of herself it belonged to the little storv of their loves for some of the sweetest moments of their courtship were those when he had leaned over that instrument and listened to the melting tones of her voice could not but smile at this instance of romantic gallantry in husband He was now going out to the cottage where his wife had been all day ite arrangement My feelings had become strongly inte-i rested in the progress of this family1 story and as it was tine evening 1 offered to accompany him He was weaned with the fatigues of the day and as we walked out fell into fit of gloomy miningPoor Mary at length broke with heavy sigh from his lips And what of her asked has any thing happened to her What said he darting an impatient glance is it nothing to be reduced to this paltry situation- to be caged in miserable cottage- to be obliged to toil almost in the menial concerns of her wretched habitation Has she then at the change Repined she has been nothing but sweetness and good humour Indeed she seems in better spirits than have ever known her she has been to me all love and tenderness and comfort Admirable girl exclaimed You call yourself poor my friend you never were so rich you never knew the boundless treasures of excellence you possessed in that woman Oh but my friend if this first meeting at the cottage were over 1 think could then be comfortable But this is her first day of real experience she has been introduced into humble dwelling she has been employed all day in arranging its miserable equipments- she has for the first time known the fatigues of domestic employment she has for the first time looked around her on home destitute of every thing elegant and almost convenient and may now be sitting down exhausted and spiritless brooding over prospect of fu ture poverty There was degree of probability in this picture that 1 could not gainsay so we walked on in silence After turning from the main road up narrow lane so thickly shaded by forest trees as to give it complete air of seclusion we came in sight of the cottage It was humble enough in its appearance for the most pastoral poet and yet it had pleasing rural look wild vine had overrun one end with profusion of few roes threw theires gracefully over it and observed several pots of dowers tastefully disposed about the door and on the grass plot in front small wicket gate open ed upon footpath that wound thro' some shrubbery to the door Just as we approached we heard the sound of music Leslie grasped my arm we paused and listened It was Mary's voice in style of the most touching simplicity sinking little air of which her husband was peculiarly fond felt Leslie's hand tremble on my arm He stepped forward to hear more distinctly Mis step made noise on the gravel walk bright beautiful face glanced out at the window and vanished light footstep was heard and Mary came tripping forth to meet us She was in pretty rural dress of white few wild

assured me that though the world toad since gone prosperously with him and his life has been happy one yet never has he experienced moment of such unutterable felicity","prose"

The entire expenditures ofthe department, including pay for trans_portation credited to the Pacific railroads,was $92;185,195.11, which may be consid_ered as the cost of receiving, carryingand delivering the above mail matter. Itthus appears that though the secondclass matter constituted more than two_revenue derived from it was less thanone-thirtieth of the total expense.The average revenue from each poundof first-class matter was 93 cents; fromeach pound of second-class, 8S mills; (ofthe second-class 52,348,297 was county-freematter;) from each pound of third-class,13.1 cents, and from each pound of fourth_class, 15.6 cents. The growth of weightof second-class matter has been from299,000,000 pounds in 1894 to 312,000,000 in1S95, and to almost 349,000,000 in 1896, andit is quite evident that this increasingdlrawback is far outstripping any possiblegrowth of postal revenues.Our mail service should of course besuch as to meet the wants and even theconveniences of our people at a directchargo upon them so light as perhaps toexclude the idea of our postoflice de_partment being a money-making concern,but in the face of a constantly recur_ring deficiency in its revenues and inview of the fact that we supply the bestmail service in the world, it seems to meit is quite time to. correct the abuses thatsivell enormously our annual de_ficit. If we concede the publicpolicy of carrying weekly news_napers free in the county of publi_cation, and even the policy of carryingat less than one-tenth. of their cost otherbona fide newspapers and periodicals,there can be no excuse for subjectingthe service to the further immense andincreasing loss involved, in carrying atthe nominal rate of 1 cent a pound theserial libraries, sometimes includingtrashy and even harmful literature, andother matter which, under the loose in_terpretation of a loose statute, has beengradually given secmnd-class rates, thusabsorbing all profit able returns derivedfrom first-clpss matter, which pays threeor four times more than its cost, andproducing a large annual loss to be paidby general taxation.Should at Least Pay Cost.If such secdnd-class matter paid mere_ly the cost of its handling our deficitwould disappear and a surplus resultwhich might be used to give the peoplestill better mail facilities or cheaper ratesof letter postage. I recommend that leg_islation be at once enacted to, correctthese abuses and introduce better busi_ness ideas in the regulation of our postalrates. Experience and observation havedemonstrated that certain improvementsin the organization of the postoflice de_partment must be secured before we cangain the full benefit of the immense sumsexpended in its administration. This in_volves the following reforms, which Iearnestly recommend:Desirable Rteforms in Postal Meth-.ods.There should be a small addition to theexisting inspector service to be employedin the supervision of the carrier force,which now numbers 13,000 and performsits service practically without the surveil_lance exercised over all other branchesof the postal or public service. Of course,such a. lack of supervision and freedomfrom wholesome disciplinary restraintsmust inevitably lead to imperfect ser_vice. There should also be appointed afew inspectors who could assist the cen_tral oflice in necessary investigation con_cerning matters of postoffice leases, post_office sites, allowances for rent, fuel andlights, and in organizing and securingthe best results from the work of the 14,_C00 clerks now employed in first and sec_ond-class offices.I am convinced that the small expenseattending the inauguration of these re_forms would actually be a profitable in_vestment. I especially recommend sucha recasting of the appropriations by con_gress for the postoffice department aswill permit the postmaster-general to pro_ceed with the work of consolidating post_offices. This work has already been en_tered upon suffticiently to fully demon_strate by experiment and experience thatsuch consolidation is productive of bet_terl service, larger revenues and less ex_penditures, to say nothing of the furtheradvantage of gradually withdrawing post_offices from the spoils system.The Universal Postal Union.The universal postal union, which nowembraces all the civilized world andwhose delegates will represent 1,000.000,000people, will hold its fifth congress in thecity of. Washington in May, 1897. TheUnited States may be said to have takenthe initiative which led to the first meet_ing of the congress at Borne in 1874 andthe formation of the universal postalunion, which brings the postal service ofall countries to every man's neighbor_hood and has wrought marvels in cheap_ening postal rates and securing abso_lutely safe mail communication through_out the world.Previous congresses have met in Berne,Paris, Lirbon and Vienna, and the re_spective countries in which they haveassembled have made generous provisionfor their accommodation and for the re_ception and entertainment of the dele_gates. In view of the importarce of thisassemblage and of its deliberations, andof the honors, and hospitalities accordedto our representatives by other countrieson similar occasions, I earnestly hopethat such an appropriation will be madefor the expenses necessarily attendantupon the coming meeting in our capitalcity, as will be worthy of our national-hospitality aid' indicative of our appre_ciation of the event.Condition of the Navy.The work of the army department andits preseit condition are fully exhibitedin the report..of .the secretary. T'he con_struction of vessels for our new navyhas been energetically prosecuted by thepresent administration upon the generallines previously adopted. the departmenthaving seen no necessity for radicalchanges in prior motive under which thework was found to be progressing in amanner highly satisfactory. It has beendecided; however, to provide in every shipbuilding contract that the builder shouldpay all trial expenses, and it has alsobeen determined to pay no speed premi_umns in future contracts. The premiumsrecently earned and some yet to be de_cided are features of the contracts madebefore this conclusion was reached.Increase in Number of War Vessels.On March 4, 1893, there were in commis_sion but two armored vessels, the double_turreted monitors, Miantonomoh and Mon_terey. Since that date, of vessels there_tofore authorized, there have been placedin their first commission three first classand two second class battle ships, twoarmored cruisers, one harbor defenserams and five double-turreted monitors,including the Maine and the Puritan justcompleted. Eight new unarmored cruis_ers and two new gunboats have also beencommissioned. The Iowa, another battleship, will be completed about March 1,and at least four more gunboats will beready for sea in the early spring. It isgratifying to state that our ships andtheir outfits are believed to be equal tothe best that can be manufactured else_where and that such notable reductionshave been made in their cost as to justifythe statement that quite a number of ves_sels are now being, constructed at ratesas low as those that prevail in Europeanshipyards.Facilities for Equipment Ample.Our manufacturing facilities are atthis time ample for all possible navalcontingencies. Three of our navy yards,those at Mare island, Cal.,_ Norfolk, Va.,and Brooklyn, N. Y.. are equipped forship building, our ordnance plant inWashington is equal to any: in the worldand at the.torpedo station we are suc_cessfully making the highest grades ofsmokeless powder.. Three .first-class pri_vate shipyards, at Newport News, Phila_delphia' and San Francisco, are buildingbattleships; eleven contractors, situatedin the states of Maine, Rhode Island,Pennsylvania, 'New Jersey, Marylano,Virginia and the state of Washington,are constructing gunboats or torpedoboats; two plants are manufacturinglarge, quantities of first-class, armor,and American factories are producingautomobile torpedo and powder projec_tiles, rapid fire guns and everythingnecessary for the outfit of naval vessels.New Vessels Authorized.There have been authorized by con_gress since March, 1893, five battleships,six.light-dyaft gunboats, sixteen torpedoboats and one submarine torpedo boat.Contracts for the building of all of themhave' been let. The secretary expressesthe opinion that we have for the presenta sufficient supply of cruisers and gun_boats, and that hereafter the construc_tion. of battleships and torpedo boatswill supply our needs.Cairrying on Departmuental Business.Much attention has been given to themethods of carrying on departmentalbusiness. Important modifications in theregulations have been made, tending 'tounify the conti'ol of ship building, as faras may be, under the bureau of con_struction and repair, and also to improvethe mod& of purchasing, supplies for thenavy by the bureau of supplies and ac_counts. The establishment, under recentacts of congress, of a supply fund, with.which to purchase-these supplies in largequantities, and other modifications ofmethods, have tended materially to theircheapening and bettier quality.Value: of the War College.The war college has developed 'into aninstitution which it is believed wi'l be ofgreat value to the navy in teaching thescience of war as well as in stimulatingprofessional zeal in the davy; and it willbe especially useful in the devising ofplans for the utilization, in case of ne_cessity, of all the naval resources of theUnited States. The secretary has'per_sistently adhered to the plan he foundin operation for securing labor at navyyards, through boards of labor employ_ment and has done much to make it morecomplete and efficient. The naval officerswho are familiar with this system and itsoperations express the decided opinionthat its results have been to vastly im_l,[vve the Lilaracter or te worK nOne atour yards and greatly reduce its cost.Discipline among the officers and, men ofthe navy has been maintained to a highstandard, and the percentage of Amer_ican citizens enlisted has been very muchincreased.Holding Ships in Reserve.The secretary is considering, and willformulate during the coming winter aplan for laying up ships in reserve, there_by largely reducing the cost of main_taining our vessels afloat. This plan con_templates that battle ships, torpedo boatsand such of the cruisers as are not neededfor active service at sea shall be kept inreserve with skeleton crews on board tokeep them in condition, cruising onlyenough to insure the efficiency of theships and their crews in time of activity.The economy of this system is too obvi_ous to need comment.The Naval Militia.The naval militia which was authorizeda few years ago as an experiment, hasnow developed into a body of enterpris_ing young men, active and energetic inthe discharge of their duties and promis_ing great .usefulness. This establishmenthas, nearly the same relation to. our navyas the national guard in the differentstates bears to our army and it consti_tutes a source of. supply for our navalforces, the importance of which is im_mediately a!)parent.The Interior Department.The report of the secretary of the in_terior presents a comprehensive and in_teresting exhibit of the numerous and im_portant affairs committed to his super_vision. It is impossible in this communi_cation to do more than briefly refer to afew of the subjects concerning whichthe secretary gives full and instructiveinformation. The money appropriated onaccount of this department and for itsdisbursement for the fiscal year ended IJune 30, 1896, amounted to more than $157,_000,000 or a greater sum than was appro_priated for the entire maintenance of thegovernment for the two fiscal years endedJune 30, 1861.The Public nLands.Our public lands, originally amountingto 1,840,000,000 acres have been so reducedthat only about 600,000,000 acres still re_main in government control, excludingAlaska. The balance, being by far themost valuable portion, have been givenaway to settlers, to new states and torailroads, or sold at a comparativelynominal sum. The patenting of land inexecution of railroad grants has pro_gressed rapidly during the year, andsince the 4th day of March, 1893, about25,000,000 acres.have been thus conveyed tothese corporations. I agree with the sec_retary that the remainder of our pub_lic lands should be more carefully dealtwith and their alienation guaranteed bybetter economy and greater prudence.A National Forestry System.The commission appointed from themembership of the National Academyof Sciences, provided for by an act ofcongress to formulate plans for a na_tional forestry system will, it is hoped,soon be prepared to present the resultsof thorough and intelligent examinationof this important subject.Our Indiain Polpulation.The total Indian population of theUnited States is 177,235, according to acensus made in 1895. exclusive of thosewithin the state of New York and thosecomprising the five civilized tribes. Ofthis number there are approximately 38,_000 childrein of school age. During theyear 23,393 of these were enrolled inschools. The progress which has attend_ed recent efforts to extend Indian schoolfacilities and the anticipation of contin_ued liberal appropriations to that end,cannot fail to afford the utmost satis_faction to those who believe that theeducation of Indian children is a primeTactor in the accomplishment, of Indiancivilization. It may be said in generalterms that in every particular the im_provement of the Indians under govern_ment care has been most marked andencouraging.Sale of Liquor to Indians.The secretary, the commissioner of In_dian affairs and the agents having chargeof Indians to whom allotments have beenmade recently, urge the passage of a lawprohibiting the sale of liquor to allotteesand who have taken their lands in sev_eralty. I earnestly join in this recom_mendation and venture to express thehope that the Indian may be speedily pro_tected against this greatest of all ob_stacles to his well-being and advance_ment.Future of the Indian Territory.The condition of affairs among the fivecivilized tribes who occupy large tractsof land in the Indian territory and whohave governments of their own, has as_sumed such an aspect as to render italmost indispensable that there should bean entire change in the relations of theseIndians to the general government. Thisseems to be necessary in furtherance oftheir own 4nterests, as well as for theprotection of the non-Indian residents intheir territory. A commission organizedand empowered under several recent lawsis now negotiating with these Indians forthe relinquishment of their courts and thedivision of their common lands in ,ev_eralty, and are aiding in the settlementof troublesome questions of tribal mem_bership. The reception of their firstproffers of negotiation was not encour_aging; but through patience and such con_duct on their part as has demonstratedthat their intentions were friendly and inthe interest of the tribes the prospectof success has become more promising.The effort should be to save these In_dians from the consequences of their ownmistakes and improvidence and to secureto the real Indian his rights as againstintruders and professed friends who profitby his retrogression.A change is also needed to protect lifeand property through the operation ofcourts conducted according to stlict jus_tice and strong enough to enforce theirmandates. As a sincere friend of theIndian I am exceedingly anxious thatthese reforms should be accomplishedwith the consent and aid of the tribesand that no necessity may be presentedfor radical or drastic legislation. I hope,therefore, that the commission now con_ducting negotiations will soon be ableto report that progress has been madetoward a friendly adjustment of exist_ing difficulties.It alppears that a very valuable depositof gilsonite or asphaltum has been foundon the reservation in Utah occupied 'by the","prose"

The time and attention of theRadical leaders have been almost wholly directcd to devising such legislatlin, ad will intheir view host preserve their ascendency, andno regard for the wise restraints lml)ssil bythe constitution hias;ehelcked their recklessand desperate career: The I'resilcent of theUnited Litates has been formatly announcedas it candidate for re-election. Thetdeclanrtiolns of his selish suplporters havebeen echoed by nI sbh: idied press, and thedisciplline of puty has already mnado adhesionto his personal tortunes tile btlptrne test ofpjilieil fealty.

When the sad experience of thelast two years, so disappointing to the hopesand generous cofundence or the country, isconsidered in connmetion with the violent nt_teroence and rash purposes of those who coil_trol the 1'realdent's policy, it is not surpris_inlug that the gravest apprehensionsfor the future peace of the nation should beotertained. At a time when labor is de_pressed, and every mafersl interest is pal'ledvb oppressive taxation, the public otlieos havebeen multiplied beyond all precedent, to serveas instruments in the perpetuotion of his pow_er. l'artisanahip is the only test applied to thedistribution fo this vast lpatrona1e. lion_tctv, lituess and Illrul worth arc openly dis_carded in favor of truckling submlnssion anddishllonorablu compliance; hence thie lornounsdefulcation and wide-spread corruption havefollowed as a natural consequence this per_nition1s system, By the ofticial report of theSecretary of the Treasury it appiard that aftter the deduction of all the proper credltatmany mnillions of dollars roeman due fromEx-Collestors of the latelnal Revenue, andno proper diligence has ever beenused to collect them.

Nearly two hundred thousandmillion acres of pubIic lands, whihk shouldhave been reserved for tihe benefitof the people, have bceu votedaway to grant corporutions, neglectingour soldiers and eunrictluo a handful ofgreedy speculators and lobblyists, who arethereby enabled to exercise most dangerousand col ruptin influlence over State and fed_eral legislation, If the career of these con_spirators be not checked the down_fall of a free government is in_evilable, and with It the elevationof a military dictator on the ruins of the Re_public. Under the pretense of passing lawsto enforcethe Fourteenth amendment, andfor other purposes, Congress has conferredmost despotic powers upon the executive,and provided an official machinery by whichthe liberties ',o the people are menaced,and the sacred right of local self governmentin the Stktcs ignored, If not ty3ranically over,thrown.

Our hopes for redressare, In the calm, good sense, and sobersecond tthought of the American people. Wecall upon them tq be true to themselves, andto their post, anil disregarding party namesand minor dellerences, to Insist upona decent equalization or power, the restric_tion of Federal ahthority within Its just andproper limits, ltaving to the States that con.trol of onr domestic affairs which is essentialto their happiness, tranquility and good gov_eminent. Everything that malicious integritycould suggest has' been done to Irritatethe people in the micdle and Southern StatesGross and exaggerated charges:ot disorder andviolence owe thelr origin to the mistchevonsminds of political managers in the Senate andDlouse of Representatives, to which the exe_cutive has, we regret to cay, lent his aid, andthus helped to Inflame the popelar feeling. Inall this course of hostile legislation andharsh resenitment no word of conciliation,of kind encouragement, or fraternal fellow_ship has ever been spoken by the President orby Congress to the people of the 'SouthernStates. They have been addressed only In thelanguage of prescription. We earnest.ly entreat our fellow citizens in allparts of the Union to spare no eO_fort to maintain peace and order, tocarefully protiet the rights of every citizen,pieserve kindly relations among all men, andto discountenance and discourage any viola_tions of the rights of any portion of the peo_>le, secured under too Constitution or any ofIts amendments. Let us in conclusionearnestly beg of you not to aid thepresent attempts of radical partisansto stir up strife min the land to renew issues ofwar, or to obstruct the return of peace andprosperity to the Southern States; because Itis thus that they seek to divert the attentionof the country from the corruption and ex_travagance of their administration of publicafahirs and the dangerous and profliggte at,tempts they are making toward the creationof a centralized military government.

Notwithstanding the exciting scenes we have passed, nothing has ocurred to disturb the general peace, or to derange the harmony ofour system. The great spectacle has been exhibited of a nation, approximating in toof people, having performed the high and important function of electing the for the term of four years, without the commission of any acts of violence, or the manifestation of a spirit of Insubordination to the laws. The great and inestimable right of suffrage, has been exercised by all who were invested with it, tinder the laws of the different states, in a spirit dictated alone by a desire, in the selection of the agent, to advance the interests of the country, and to place beyond jeopardy the institutions under which it is our happiness to live. That the deepest interest has been by all our countrymen in the result of the election, is not less true, than highly creditable to them. Vast multItudes have assembled, from time to time, at various places, for the purpose of canvasing the merits and pretensions of those who were presented for their sufFrage; but no armed soldiery has been necessary to restrain, within proper limits, the popular zeal, or to prevent violent outbreaks. A principle more controling was found in the love of order and obedience to the laws, which, with individual exceptions, everywhere possesses the A,, mind, and controls all fi-r powerful than hosts of armed men. We cannot dwell upon this picture recognizing it it that deep and devoted attachment on the part of the people, to the institutions under which we! live, which their perpetuity. The great objection which has prevailed against the election, by the people, of their chief executive officer, has been the apprehension and disorders, which might involve in ruin the entire government. A security against this, is found not only in the fact before alluded to, but in the additional fact that, we live under a confederacy etin bracing already twenty six states; no one of which has power to control the election. The vote In each state is taken at the time appointed by the laws, and such vote is announced by its Electoral College, without reference to the decision of the other states 'The right of suffrage, and the mode of conducting the election, is by the laws of each state; and the election is distinctly federative in all its prominent features. Thus it is that, unlike what might be the result under a consolidated system, riotous proceedings, should they , could only the elections in single states, without disturbing ihe tranquility of others. The great experiment of a political -each member of which is -as to all matters appertaining to its local interests, and its internal peace and happiness; while bya with others, it confides to the united power of all, the of its citizens, it not been so fair crowned with complete success.

that I guess he must have been a girl
when he was a boy.""
The New York World observes:
""The man who","unknown"
"221","1972","office use his influence to fasten the gold standÂ­
ard upon the American people. [Great cheerÂ­
ing.]
My convictions upon this subject are not
shallow oonvictions. I may be in error, my
friends; none of us can claim infallibility.
But we have experience of history to guide us
and our judgment and our consciences, and I
stand where the members of the silver convenÂ­
tion stood. I would rather have the approvÂ­
al of my conscience than the applause of the
entire earth. I may be In error, but I believe
that the gold standard is a conspiracy against
the human race, [Cheers.]
I would no sooner join the ranks of those
whose purpose is to fasten that upon the
people than to enlist in an army that was
marching to attack my home and kill my
family. [Renewed cheering.] I can say,
therefore, that I can appreciate the spirit
which animated those who have just tendered
me this second nomination, and I can thereÂ­
fore accept it in the spirit in which they preÂ­
sent it. And I pledge them that if elected
they shall never nave cause to accuse me of
being false to that trust. [More cheering.]
My friends, when I declared that I would
not support a gold standard candidate I was
standing upon the history of the Democratic
party. I was defending its principles as well
as the interests or the country at large. And
when these Republicans who assembled in the
silver convention at St. Louis refused to
worship the golden image which their party
had set up they were defending the history of
the Republican party. [Applause] The ReÂ­
publican platform of 1883 denounces the
Democratic administration for having atÂ­
tempted to degrade silver. And in 1891 on
the 11th day of February in Memorial Hall at
Toledo. Ohio, on the Lincoln day bauquet, the
present candidate for President upon the ReÂ­
publican ticket used the words which 1 shall
now read to you. I have found these words
published in a Toledo paper, and they have
been published so long without correction
that we may safely assume that he was corÂ­
rectly reported. If he shall deny the correctÂ­
ness of this report I shall hasten to do him
justice by retracting these words. These are
the words which he is said to have used:
""During all of Grover Cleveland's years at
the head of the Government he was dishonorÂ­
ing one of our precious metals, one of our own
great productsâ€”discrediting silver and enÂ­
hancing the price of gold. He endeavored
even it-fore his Inauguration to office to stop
the coinage of silver dollars, and afterward
and to the end of his administration persistÂ­
ently used his power to that end. He was deÂ­
termined to contract the circulating medium
and demonetize one of the coins of commerce,
limit the volume of money among the people
make money scarce and therefore dear. He
would have Increased the value of money and
diminished the value of everything elseâ€”
money' the man , everything else the seiÂ­
vant."" [Great cheering.]
Following these same lines the Republican
Convention in 1*92 declared at Minneapolis
that the American people, from tradition and
interest, were in favor of bimetallism. [A
voice, ""That's so.] That is the language in
1892 that the American people, from tradition
ana interest, are In favor of bimetallism.
Have traditions changed In four years? [A
voice. ""No.""] Have interests cnanged In four
years? [A voice, ""No.""] No, my friends, and
yet, forgetting the platlorinof 1830, forgetting
the denunciation uttered by their distinÂ­
guished leader in 1891, forgetting the platÂ­
lorm of 1892, the Republican party in convenÂ­
tion assembled declared that the Amer.can
people must forego the advantages of the biÂ­
metallic system to which tradition and interÂ­
est indorsed them until foreign nations should
bring these advantages to them. [Applause 1
It is not'strange that men who had looked lor
bimetallism in the Republican puny should
have given up hope and turned elsewhere for
relief.
These Republicans cannot be criticized for
leaving the Republican party. They have done
what every American citizen has a right to do.
They have done better than our Democratic
advocates of the gold standard have done, beÂ­
cause these Republicans when they left the
party joined with those who had a chance to
succeed, while our Democratic advocates of the
gold standard sought to secure the election of
a Republican, McKlnley, by nominating a

                 By MRlS. A. C. WAKEFIELD.
                 Over Ihc river they beckon to me,
                 Loved ones who've crossed to the fur-
                 tber side;
                 The gleam of their snowy robes I see
                 But their voices are lost in the dashing
                 tide.
                 Tbere's one with ringlets of sunny gold,
                 And eycs the reflection of Heaven's own
                 blue;
                 lle crossed in the twiligbt, gray and cold,
                 And the pale mist bid him from mortal
                 view.
                 We saw not the angels who met him tbere,
                 The gates of the city we could not see, Over the river-over the liver-
                 My brother stands waiting to welcome me.
                 Over the river the boatman pale
                 Cairied another, the housuold pet:
                 Her brown curls waved in the gentle gale-
                 Darling Minnie I I Eec her yet.
                 She crossed on her bosom her dimpled
                 hands,
                 And fearlessly entered the phantom
                 barque-
                 We felt it gliae from the silver sands,
                 And all our sunshine grew strangely dark. WVe know she is safe on the further side,
                 Where all the ransomed and angels be; Over the river-the mystio river-
                 Jly childhood's idol is waiting for me.
                 For none return from those quiet shores,
                 Wuo cross with the hoatman cold and
                 pale-
                 We bear the dip of the golden oars,
                 And catch a gleam of the snowy sail;
                 And lo! they have passed from our yearn-

                 IVIlQ Q!9Es the strertm, and are gone for

                 I shall one day stand by the water cold,

w
elares that no persons shall be deprived tll

lands to which this section refers, may hl
not be owned. by minors, or persons of at
unsound mind, or by those who have b,
been faithful to all their obligations as ac
citizens of the United States. If any of
portion of the land is held by such perÂ­ ta

was no'Senwator or Representative in ConÂ­ to

to be'mainly affebted by its provisions.-Â­
The very fact that reports were and are ea
made against the good disposition qi

why they need and should have RepreÂ­ lc;

soelves, while the liberty of deliberation
would then be free, and Congress 'would :
have full power to decide according to
its judgment. There could be no obÂ­
jecting urged that the States 'most inÂ­
terested were not permitted to be heard. UI
The principle is'firmly fixed in the minds W'
of the American people that there could gf
be no taxation without representation.-Â­ e
Great burdens are now to be borne by a'
all the country, and we may best demand to
they shall be borne without a murmur w
when they are voted by' a majority of et
the Representatives of all the people. I tl
would not initerfere with the unquestionÂ­
.
able right of Congress to. judge, each n'
house, for itself, of'the election, returns Y
and qualifications of its own members; 'sl
but that authority cannot be. construed 's
as including the right-to put out in time tl
of peace any State frontm the represenÂ­
tation to which it is entitled 'by the ConÂ­ o
stitution. At present, all the people of b
the eleven States are excluded--those
who were most faithful during the war
not less than others. The State of Teno-, C
esseoe, for instance, whose authorities b
were engaged in the rebellion, was resÂ­
tored to all her 'constitutional relations tE
to the Union, by the 'patriotism and e
energy of her injured, ajmd betrayed peoÂ­
pie.
' Before th~wa.Â­ was brought to .-a
termination, they had placed' theomselves

' the, General GbveriÂ­ P

had established aÂ­ State GovernÂ­ 8
ment of their own. As they were not t1
included in the emancipation proelam-i
ation, they, by their own 'acts, have t
amended their Constitution so as to
abolish slavery within the limits of their e
ownState. I know no -reason why the *
State of Tennessee, for example, should t
not fully enjoy her constitutional reÂ­ t
lations to the United States. ,'The PresiÂ­ a

Ammonia and alum are the most common
adulterants used in the manufacture of bakÂ­
ing powders. The government report shows
that a large percentage of the baking powders
on the market contain either one or the other
or both these pernicious drugs.
What woman would use an ammonia or
alum baking pbnder if she knew it? Such
powders not only undermine the health, but
ammonia gives'to the complexion a sallow or
blotched appearance. The presence of amÂ­
monia or alum in a baking powder, however,
can easily bb detected.

"236","22619","SUNSTROKE,
The Board of Health in New York

, ciiv has issued a circular on the sub-
jeef of Sunstroke which has been
; priuted in English aud German, and is
to be circulated througti the city, es-
; pecidiy among the laboring classes,
j To an extract trom ihe circular we add
j a word of preface of our own, which
is, that nothing is more important in
the summer season, as a preventive
to the evil effects ot heat than to keep
; ' he stomach in a healthy stale. We
! believe that a large portion of the
j cases of sunstroke are caused by a
: di ordered stomach. The brain is in
j the closest sympathy with it, as every
one knows from his own experience,
Sunstroke is caused by excessive
i heat, and especially it the weather is
i ""muggy."" It is more apt to occur ou
the second, third or fourth day of a
heated term than on the first. Loss of
sleep, worry, excitement, close sleepÂ­
ing rooms, debility, abuse of stimuÂ­
lants, predispose to it. It is more apt
to attack those working in the sun,
and especially between the hours of
J.1 o'clock in the forenoon aud 4 in the
afternoon. On hot days wear thin
clothing. Have as cool sleeping
rooms as possible. Avoid loss of
sleep and all unnecessary fatigue. If
working indoors aud where there is
artificial heat laundries, see Ihat
the rooms are well ventilated.
If working in the sun, wear a light
hat (not black, as it absorbs the heat)
straw, &c, and put inside of it ou the
head a wet cloth or a large green leaf;
frequently lift the hat from the head
and see that the cloth is wet. Do not
check perspiration, but drink what
water you need to keep it up, as perÂ­
spiration prevetits the body from beÂ­
ing over-heated. Have whenever
possible, an additional shade, as a thin
umbrella, when walking, a canvass or
board cover when working in the sun,
When much fatigued do uot go to
work, but be excused from; work, esÂ­
pecially .after 11 o'clock in the foreÂ­
noon ou very hot days if the work is
n the sun. If a feeling of fatigue,
dizziness, headache, or exhaustion ocÂ­
curs.cease work immediately, lie down
in a shady and cool place; apply cold
cloths to and pour cold water over
head and neck. It anyone is overcome
by the heat send immediately for the
nearest good physician. While waitÂ­
ing tor the physician give the person
cool drinks ot water or cold black tea,
or cold coffee if able to swallow. If
the skin is hot and dry, sponge with
or pour cold water over the body aud
limbs, and apply to the head pounded
ice wrapped in a towel or cloth. If
there is no ice at hand keep a cold
cloth ou the head, and pour cold water
on it as well as on the body. If the
person is pale, very faint, and pulse
very feeble, let him inhale ammonia
for a few seconds, or give him a teaÂ­
spoonful of aromatic spirits of amÂ­
monia iu two tablesponufuls of water
with a lit tic sugar.

What Sleep will Cure.
The cry tor rest has always been loudÂ­
er than the cry for food. Not that it is
more important, but it is often harder to
get. The best rest comes from sound
sleep. Of two men or women, otherÂ­
wise equal, the one who sleeps the best
will be the most moral, healthy and efficÂ­
ient.
Sleep will do much to cure irritability
of temper, peevishness, uneasiness. It
will cure insanity. It will restore to vigÂ­
or an over-worked brain. It will build
up and make strong a weary body. It
will do much to cure dyspepsia,'particuÂ­
larly that variety known as nervous
dyapepsia. It will relieve the languor
and prostration felt by consumptives.
It will cure hypochoin'dria. It will

MORE AMENDMENTS ADDED.
Mr. Plumb moved to add a new section,
to come in as section 2, as follows:
That the provisions of sectionh
, of an act to
euthqrize the coinage of the standard silver dolÂ­
lai Ina to restore its legal tender character,
which became a law Feb. 28, 1878, is hereby
made applicable to the coinage in this act proÂ­
vided for.
-Agreed to without division.
Mr. Reagan offered the following amendÂ­
ment as a substitute for sections 3, 4 and 5:
Sec. S. That the certificates provided for in
the second section of this act shall be of deniomiÂ­
nations of not less than $1 nor more thin $100~




 and such certificates shall be redeemable in
coin of standard value. A sufficient sum to
carry out the provisions of the act is hereLy ap.
propriated out of any money in the treasury
not otherwise appropriated. The provisions in
section I of the act of Feb. 28, 1878, entitled,
""an act to authorize the coinage of the standard
dollar and to restore its legal tender character,""
which requires the secretary of the treasury to
purchase, at the market price thereof, not less
than -$2,000,000 worth of silver bullion per
month, nor more than $4,000,000 worth per
month of such bullion, is hereby repealed.
At this juncture Mr. Edmunds arose to
declare his unqualified opposition to the
bill and all of its amendments. A timeÂ­
consuming discussion followed, particiÂ­
pated in by Messrs. Edmunds, Plumb and
Vest, which was ended by Mr. Teller movÂ­
ing to add the following as a new section:
That the certificates provided for in this act
shall be receivable for all taxes and uones to the
United States, of every description, and shall be
a legal tender for the payment of all debts, pub.
lic and private.
Alter a long discussion it was modified
(at the suggestion of Mr. Eustis) by adding
the words ""and all silver certificates
already issued,"" and as so modified it was
agreed to-yeas 34, nays 22.
Mr. Plumb moved to insert the followÂ­
ing as an additional section:
The owners of bullion, deposited for coinage,
shall have the option to recive coin or its
equivalent in the certificates provided for in

THE BILL AS PASSED BY THE SENATE.
The following is the bill as it now stands:
Section 1. That from and after the date of
the passage of this act the unit of value in the
United States shall be the dollar, and the same
may be coined of 412j grains of standard silver,
or of twenty-five and eight-tenths grains of
standard gold; and the said coins shall be
equally legal tender for all debts, public or pri.
vate; that thereafter any owqer of silver or gold
bullion may deposit the same at any mint of the
United States, to be formed into standard dolÂ­
lars, or bars, for his benefit, and without charge;
but it shall be lawful to refuse any deposit of
less value than $100, or any bullion so base as
to be unsuitable for the operations of the mint,
Sec. 2. That the provisions of Sec.

visions of this act is hereby appropriated out of
any money in the treasury not otherwise approÂ­
priated. The provisions in Sec. 1 of the act of
Feb. 28, 1878, entitled ""An act to authorize the
coinage of the standard silver dollar, and to
restore its legal tender character,"" which reÂ­
quires the secretary of the treasury to purchase,
at the market price thereof, not less than $2,000,.
000 worth of silver bullion per month, nor more
than $4,000,000 worth per month, of such bullion,

vided for in this act, and such bullion shall be

PROBABLE ACTION OF THE HOUSE.
Opinions as to the probable","unknown"
"241","25687","I nteresting S tatistics .â€”A gentleman who
keeps the run of facts figures and babies, says
the N. Y. Dutchman, has just laid before ""an
inquiring world "" the following statistics :
The whole number of languages spoken in
the world amount to 30G4> viz ; 686 in Europe,
937 in Asia, 275' in Africa, and 1364 in America.
The inhabitants of our globe profess more than
1000 different religions. The number of men is
about equal to the number of women. The aveÂ­
rage of human life is about 33 years. One
fourth die previous to the age of 7 years, one
half before reaching 17 years of age, and those
who pass that age enjoy a felicity (?) refused to
one half the human species. To every 1000
persons, only one reaches a 100 years of age ;
to every 100 only six reach the age of 66, and
not more than one in 500 live to 80 years of
ageÂ­
There are on the earth 1,000,000,000 inhabiÂ­
tant, and of these 333,333,333 die every year,
91,324 every day, 2<30 every hour, 60 every
minute, or one every second. The losses are
about balanced by an equal number of births.
The married are longer-lived than the single,
and above all, those who observe a sober and
industrious conduct. Tall men live longer than
short ones! Women have more chances of life
in their favor previous to being 50 years of age,
than men, but fewer afterwards.
The number of marriages is in proportion of
175 to every 1000 individuals. Marriages are
more frequent after the equinoxesâ€”that is, duÂ­
ring tlic months of June and December.
Those born in the spring are generally more
robust than others. Births and deaths are more
frequent by night than by day. The number of
men capable of working or bearing arms is calÂ­
culated at one-fourth of the population.
Some of these statements are rather singular,
and yet many of them are susceptible of an
easy solution. That marriages take place more
frequently in June and December, than other
months of the year, was just what we have alÂ­
ways suspected was the case. Those who marÂ­
ry in June, do so because they can't help it;
while those who connubialize in December do so,
doubtless to guard against the chilly pillows
which distinguish the frost-bitten months of
winter. The matches which come off in June are
commonly love matches, and are brought about
by green fields, and the contagious influence of
bobliuks and yellow birds : whilst those which
happen in December are brought about, in a deÂ­
gree, by mixing plain mathematics with the
market value of flannel under-garments.

Mr Charles Terry, a Crimean veteran, :of :485 Kent-street, Sydney, daving been lecturing lately in the` Domain on the 'Temperance Question,' we (says the .N wospapor}) dbspatched a :reporter 'to his residence, who, gives the following verbatim account - of:' his illness and: marellous recovery.. Our representative.found Mr Terry a chatty old gentlemai of 66'. who seemed decidedly pleased to beihterviewed'on? thesubject of his. wonderful, escape from death ..In response toa few questions,, Mr Terry stated :.-' I joined: the Royal Navy about 1853;, and served, durinig the Crimea in H.M.: B~etribution, Captain Thomas Fisher, under Admiral :Dundas, bearing the flag of Rear-Admirak Baines, and I bear the Crimean decoration. I arrived in Australii at the latter end of 1877 in H.Mi.S. Sapphire, the Hon. Captaini Merry. I then joined the Diamond, underCaptain Dale, on this statiin, and on leaving. the ship quitted the service for good, having; in all served in 17 ships in her Majesty's. Royal Navy, during which time I was employed as, Admiral's; Oommodore's, and: Captain's cook. In August of this year (1896): I found iiyselfa atEmu Plains, being in theemploy of Messrs. M'Grath, fellmongers;. employed as a cook. I ft was whilst there that I was taken ill, towards the latter end,- of August. I attributed my illness to exposurein periodically leaving a hot kitchen to attend' to some outside work. My first symptoms. were coughing, a spitting of blood, and a? bloody discharge from the kidneys of theconsistency of jelly. One man there was; particularly kind to me, and constantly stayed up with me all night, giving meeucalyptus to inhale, and continuously rubf bing its into my chest, throat, and stomaeh. This man kept constantly telling me to clear out from EmuPlains and go to hospital, otherwise, to use his own words, he said, ' You willipeg out.' Feeling that he was likely to:prove'a true prophet, I followed his= advice, caine to Sydney, and took up my"" f abode at 485 Kent-street, where I still am, e living. I should, however, mention that both Mr and Mrs M'Grath gave me the highest d of references, and regretted that my bad health would not allow me to remain. (These . recommendations, which were of a most: satisfactory nature, he showed our representative.) On my arrival in Sydney I suffered from great pain in-the back and sides, and also under the ribs. I could take no solid food, and entirely subsisted on eggs and new d milk, which my landlady procured for me. I went to the Government medical officer at Circular Quay, and was so horribly weak that it took me an hour and ten minutes to get there. He told me to strip, which I did, and he then sounded me and asked me how long I had been bad. I told him that from ;y the first it was about eight weeks, upon which )r he said, ',Get away, man ; it's chronic.' He could not senrd me to Little Bay, but sugrl gested that I should go to Liverpool Asylum at once, but I refused to go there, and returned home. Ithen went to see the Grand Chief Templar. I also saw his wife and the Grand Lodge Secretary, and told them of myâ€¢r I pitiable state. With the assistance of Brother J. C. Jones, late District Deputy of the Good Templars, and the Grand Lodge Secretary, I n~. bhad medicine prescribed for me of various re kinds, which proved quite ineffectual, and o afforded menorelief whatever. I took noSless thetiseven bottles of eucalyptus, and' h even chlordyne was prescribed for me. I fell away lamentably, perspired profusely, and could not obtain any sleep. I was in t such pain that I could not shift in bed. Myright side was much the worst, and my Is breathing was most labored and painful. I s- cannot be too grateful to my friend, Brother J. C.Tones. He would stay with me forthree or four hours at atimne, and it was he Sthat saved me from going to an asylum.- One day a friend of mine read to me the account ofBoilermaker Jarvis' wonderful recdvery ** by, taking Dr. Williams' Pink Pills, and I at once procured a box. I had taken all but - two, when the blood-spitting and emission ceased. After two boxes I was able to get up and move about, and now, at the end of six boxes, feel almost well, with the exception of feeling very weak. The uenre"" was MAGICAL, and [tell all my friends arid the general public that nothing but Dr. Williams"" Pills brought me once more before them to. agitate the temperance question, and on each occiasionI have met with a g~et reception. (Mr Terry here called our reporter's attentidnto-the amount of.nuseless physic he had consumed, and,indeed, the amount of bottles reminded one of the initeriobr of a cheminist's. shop) I can speak in the-highest possibleterms -of the marvellous curative-properties of the Pink Pills.

Peace. Concention Between Generals Sher-
man and Johnston Tin- urmiigemeum
tlisapprovd at Washington.
War Departmknt,
Washington, April 22. j""
Yesterday evening a bearer of dispatchÂ­
es arrived from Geueral Sherman. An
agreement for a suspension of hostilities.
and a memorandum of what is called
basis lor peace, had been entered into on
the Sth inst., by General Sherman, with
the rebel General Johnston, and Brigadier
Geueral Breckinridge was present at the
conference. A Cabinet meeting was held
at S o'clock iu the evening, at which the
action of General Sherman was diisau-
proved by the President, by the Secretary
of War, by Gen. Grant, and by every
member oi the Cabinet. Oeueral hher
man was ordered to resume hostilities im
mediately, and was directed tnat the inÂ­
structions given by the late President, in
the following telegram, which was penned
by Mr. Lincoln hiinseir, :it the Capitol, on
the night ol tne od ot -March, were apÂ­
proved by President Andrew Johnsou
and were reiterated, to govern the action
of military commanders.
' On the night of the 3d of March, while
President Lincoln and his Cabinet were at
the Capitol, a telegram from General Grant
was brought to the secretary ot VV ar, inÂ­
forming him that Gen. Lee had requested
an interview or c-onlerence, to make an ar
rauffement for terms of peace. The letter
of General Lee was published in a letter
to Davis and to the rebel Congress. Gen.
Grant s telegram was submitted to Mr,
Lincoln, who, after pondering a few
miuutes, took up his pen and wrote with
his own hand, the'following reply, which
he submitted to the Secretary of State and
the Secretary of War. It was then dated,
addressed and signed by the Secretary of
War, and telegraphed to den. Grant:
Washington, March 3, 181512 P. M.
Lieut. General Grant:
mo president directs me to say to you
that he wishes you to have no conference
with General Lee, unless it be for the
capitulation of Gen. Lee's army, or on
some minor and purely military matter.
He instructs me to say that you are not to
decide, discuss or confer upon any politic
al questions. t?ueh questions the Presi
dent holds in his own hands, and will sub
mit them to no military conferences or
conventions. Meantime, you are to press
to the utmost your military advantages.
Signed Edwin M. Stanton,
Secretary of War.
The orders of General Sherman to Gen.
Stnncmiui to withdraw from Salisbury and
join him, will probably open ihe way for
Davis to escape to -Mexico or Lurope with
his plunder which is reported to be very
large, including not only the Richmond
banks, but previous accumulations.
A dispatch received by this Department,
from Richmond, says: It is stated here,
by respectable parties, that the amount of
specie taken South by Jeff. Davis and his
partisans is very large, including not only
the plunder ol the tfichmonu banks, but
previous'accumulations. They hope, it is
said, to make terms with General SherÂ­
man, or some other commander, by which
they will be permitted, with their effects,
including this gold plunder, to go to MexiÂ­
co or Kurope. Johnston's negotiations
look to this end.
After the Cabinet meeting, last night,
General Grant started for North Carolina
to direct operations against Johnston's
army.
Signed ' Kiiwin M. Stanton,
' ' Secretary of War.
As reports have been in circulation for
some time of a correspondence between
Generals Johnston and Sherman, the
memorandum of what was agreed upon.
and the result is as follows:

This'proceeding of General Sherman
was unapproved for the following, among
other reasons:
I-'irst It was an exercise of authority
not vested in General Sherman, and its
face shows that both he and Johnston
knew he (General Sherman) had no auÂ­
thority to enter into any such an arrangeÂ­
ment. .
Second It was a practical acknowledgÂ­
ment of the rebel Government.
Third It undertook to re-establish the
rebel State governments that had been
overthrown at the sacrifice of many thouÂ­
sand loyal lives and an immense treasure,
and placed the arms and munitions of war
in the hands of the rebels at their respecÂ­

as soon as the armies of the United States

Ninth It formed no basis of true and

the pressure of our victories, and would

there have been at :l e White house--eight
in allÂ­ .1n. never before to-day has the highÂ­
est dignitary ir
ite land bower' his head
within it~i historic walls to receive the blessÂ­
illn of the church on his union in tbt. holy
bonds of matrimony. From the very dawn
or the wedding day the city seemed alive to
the approaching ,vent. Little knots of
idlers iaiied it over on the sidewalks in front
ot hotels, sedate matrons gossiped as they
passeua along the streets, and bevies of laughs
inc girls chatted and speculated about the
coming momentous ceremony. If there be
truth in the ancient adage, a happy bride
will reign in the White house, for though
the day opened with a gray and cheerless
sky and shadows resting on the earth, yet as
it grew older the elements seemed to relent,
and, little by little, the sun forced his rays
through the unwilling clouds until his broad
beams fell in generous abundance on the soft
green sward of the trim park encompassing
the White house, bringing out in high relief
the simple yet stately white column of the
time-honored home of presidents; crystalizÂ­
ing in prismatic hues the spat'kling spray of
tile fountains, and cresting with gold the
foliage of the grand old trees.
Many were the curious glances that sought
to pierce the draped windows, and numberÂ­
less were the comments and speculations of
the loiterers who gathered early in the afterÂ­
noon within the grounds. Little. or nothing
in the appearance of the mansion or its surÂ­
roundings indicated to the casual passer-by
that the much-talked of event was at hand.
The still and murky haze of the early afÂ­
ternoon had now wholly given place to clear
skies and warm southerlv breezes; while yelÂ­
low slanting sunbeams filtered through
tile foliage of the park and made
flickering pictures upon the velvety turf beÂ­
neath. The great fountain did its best to atÂ­
tract attention. spouting its cooling spray to
the verge of its granite basin, and flowering
alrnbs and forms of tropical green filled tile
marginal gaps in the picture. Seats in the
park across the avenues were occupied by
lawn-clad maidens,
-
while half .he yomng
lovers in .own, moved by the common
sympathy which stirs the romantic susceptiÂ­
bilities of tihe 60.000.000, took the winding
walks in tile line of their evening promenade
and speculated upon the emotions which are
supposed to ill the hearts of bride and
groonm.
AT TAHE WHITE HOUSE.
On the walks near the W\Vhite house the asÂ­
semblage was thoroughly democratic; and
ragged urchins and slipshod colored l girls
jostled natty-looking young gentlemen and
ladies in silk attire. The gates were left
wide open, and by 6 o'clock the crowd had
swollen to several hundreds, and it score or
more of newspaper men ield a point of vantÂ­
age alongside the portico. The successive
aiirivals of the guests were watched with inÂ­
terest, and tieir names were wlhispered by
the more knowing to their companions.
Suddenly the strains of the wedding march
floated through the open windows and there
was a general exclamation from the outside
crowd: ""The service has begun."" Tlhen
there came a tantalizing hush within the
wadIs wIvich was soon ended by tile strains
of the bridal chorus from Lohengrin, and it
was thereby knowhn that the ceremony
was over. One by one the lights sprung
up at the windows and the great
burners on the portico cast their effulgence
over the pavements. The scene resembled a
summer night's festival and the crowd gave
itself up to the enjoyment of tihe delightful
music. With shiort intermissions thile fine
orchestra rendered the following selections:
Bolero, by MIarianna; ""Illnvitation a la
Valse,"" Weber; ""Spring Song,"" MendelsÂ­
solhn; Romance, ""Briglht Star of Hope,""
Robandi, and ""Mosaic D)esires""-Sousa.
TIIE GUEST8 ARRIVE.
About half-pact
6 o'clock the wedding
ghests began to arrive, their carriages rollÂ­


ing up to the main door of the mansion
through the great iron gates on PennsylÂ­
vania avenue. The first arrival was SecreÂ­
tary L;mar, at 6:37. He was closely folÂ­
lowed by the Rev. Dr. Sunderland and wife;
and, during the next few minutes; there
came in quick succession Postmaster-General
Vilas and wife, Mr. Wilson S. Bissel, SecreÂ­
tary and Mr.. Endicott, Secretary Bayard,
Secretary and Mrs. Whitney, and Secretary
Manning and his wife. Removing their
wraps in the state dining-room, all the
guests proceeded to the blue room, where
they were received by Miss Rose Cleveland.
The following is a complete list of those
present: Mrs. Folsom, mother of the bride;
the Rev. W. M. Cleveland, the president's
brother; Miss Cleveland and Mrs. Hoyt, the
president's sisters; Thomas F. Bayard, secÂ­
retary of state; Daniel Manning, secretary
of the treasury; Mrs. Manning; Wmin. C.
Endicott, secretary of war; Mrs. Endicott;
Win. C. Whitney, secretary of the navy;
Mrs. Whitney; Wm. F. Vilas, the
postmaster general; Mrs. Vilas; L. Q. LaÂ­
mar, secretary of the interior; Daniel S.
Lamont, private secretary to the president;
Mrs. Lamont; Benjamin Folsom, of Buffalo,
N. Y.; Mr. and Mrs. Rogers, of Seneca

dleston. of Detroit, Mich.; Mr. and Mrs.
Harmon, of Boston, Mass., relatives of the
bride; Miss Nelson, of New York; Mr. W.
8. Bissell, of Buffalo, N. Y., the president's
former law partner; Dr. and Mrs. Byron
Sunderland. Atty.-GCen. Garland although
invited was not present.
For a few minutes the guests chatted gaily,
but conversation was quickly suspended at
7:15 P. ar. o'clock when a selected orchesÂ­
tra fi'om the Marine band sta
tioned in the corridor struck up
the familiar strains of the wedding march
from Mendelssohn's ""'Midsummner Night's
Dream,"" and all eyes were turned to the
doorway to catch the first glimpse of the coinÂ­
ing bride and groom. Starting from the
western corridor on the upper floor the presiÂ­
dent came slowly down the western staircase
with his bride leaning on his arm. They
were unaccompanied; even the bride's mother
awaiting her with the other guests. Passing
through the central corridor, the bride and
groom entered the blue room, and took a
position near its southern wall, which was
completely hidden from sight by a mass of
nodding
palms, tropical grasses and an endÂ­
less variety of choice flowers. The crystal
chandelier poured a flood of mellow radiance
upon the scene, and the colors of the massive
banks of scarlet begonias and royal jaqqueÂ­
minot roses mingling with the blue and silver
tints of frescoea walls and ceiling, gave a
warm and glowing tone to the whole brilliant
interior. The delicate ivory shades of the
bride's wedding-gown found an exquisite
setting in the masses of crimson roses imÂ­
mediately beyond. The president was in full




 evening dress, ,:it;Ih turndown collar, white
lawn necktie and whiq ena melled studs.

MADE ONE FLEII.
Addressing the company, Dr. Sunderland
said:
""Marriage is honorable among all men in
that a ian shall leave his father aid mother
antd shall cleave unto his wile, and the twain
shall be one flesh. It was constituted by our'
Creator in the lirst pradise. It was confessed

man and this woman come now to enter. If
any iiow can shoe just cause why they may
not be lawiilly united in marriage let him

To the bride and groom:
""if you desire to be united in marriage
you will signify the same by joining your
right hands.'
The groom and bride joined hands.

The Rev. Mr. Cleveland then pronounced
the following benediction:
""God the Father, God the Son and God
the Holy Ghost, bless, preserve and keep
you. The Lord mercifully fill you with all
temporal and all spiritual blessiuns and
grant that you may so live together in this
world that in the world to come you may
have life everlasting. Amen.""
At the conclusion of the ceremony, Mrs.
Folsom, showing traces of deep emotion, was
the first to tender her congratulations to the
newly-married pair. She was followed by
Miss Cleveland, the Rev. Mr. Cleveland and
the other relatives and friends in turn.
While the congratulations were in progress.
the band. under the leadership of Prof.
Sousa, performed the bridal chorus and
march from Lohengrin, and to this niusic
the president and his wife led the way into
the stately east room. The adornments of
this noble hall were in keeping with its maÂ­
jestic proportions; and its ample space and
brilliant illumination afforded an opportunity
for a fitting display of the ladies' toilets.
BRILLIANT TOILETIS.
The bride wore an enchanting wedding
dress of ivory satin simply garnished .n the
high corsage with Indian muslin, crossed in
Grecian folds and carried in exquisite falls
of simplicity over the petticoat. The orange
blossom garniture commencing upon the veil
in a superb coronet is continued throughout
the costume with artistic skill. Her veil of
tulle, about five yards in length, completely
enveloped her, falling to the edge of the petÂ­
ticoat in front and extending the entire
length of her full court train. She carried
no flowers and wore no jewelry except an
engagement ring, containing a sapphire and
two diamonds, and a plain gold wedding ring,
which was placed on her finger before she
decended the stair case.
Mrs. Folsom wore a superb dress of violet
satin with garniture in white failte, with
crystalized violet drops in pendants.
Miss Cleveland wore an exquisite dress, a

REDUCTION OF REVYNUE.
In my last annual message to Congress attenÂ­
tion was directed to the fact that the revenues of
the Government exceed its actual needs and it
was suggested that legislative action should be
taken to relieve the people of the necessary burÂ­
den of laxation thusmnade apparent. In view of
the pressing importance of the subject, I deem
it my duty again to urge its consideration. The
income of the Government, with its increased
volume and thorough economy in its collection,
is now more than ever in excess of public neÂ­
cessities. The application of the surplus to the
pasumeut of such portion of the public debt as
is now at our option, subject to extinguishÂ­
Ient, it continued at the rate which
has lately prevailed, would retire that class
of indebtedness within less than one year from
this date. Trus a continuation of our present
uevenue would soon result in the receipt of an
annualincome mluch greater than necessary to
meet Government expenses with no indebted.
ness upon which it could be applied. We should
then be confronted with a vast quantity of money,
the cJrculating medium of the people, hoarded in
the Treasury, when it should be in their hands;
or we should be drawn into wasteful public exÂ­
travagauce with all the corrupting national deÂ­
moralization which follows in its train.
But it is not the simple existence
of this surplus and its threatened attendant evils
whlich furnish the strongest argument against
our present scale of Federal taxation. Its worst
hllase is the exaction of such a surplus througlh
a l;erversion of tie relations between the people
and their Government, and a dangerousdeparting
trom the rules which limit tile riglt of Federal
taxation. Good government, of which every
American citizen boasts, has for its objects
the protection of -every person within its
borders, with the greatest liberty consistent
with the good of the country, and hlis
perfect security in the enjoyment of his
earnings, with the least possible diminution for
public needs. Wncn more of the people's susÂ­
tenance is exacted.tl4ough tue form of taxation
than is necessary to meet the just obligations of
the Government and the expense of its economiÂ­
cal administration, such action becomes ruthless
extortion and a violation of the fundamental
principles of free government. The indirect
manner itn which those exactions are inade has a
tendency to conceal their true character andt
their extent. But we have arrived at a stage of
surperfluous revenue which has aroused tile peoÂ­
ple to a realization of tihe fact tllat the amount
raised professedly for the support of tile GovernÂ­
ment is paid by them as absolutely, if added to
the price of the things which supply their daily
wants, as if it was raid at fixed periods into tile
hands tof the Itax-gattherer. Those who toil for
datlily wages are beginning to understand that
capital, though sometimes vatnting its imporÂ­
tance and clamoring for the protection and favor
of the Government, is dull and sluggish till,
touched by the magical hand of labor, it
springp into activity, furnisming an occaÂ­
sion for Federal taxation, and gaining
the value which enables it to bear
its burden, agd the laboring man is tlhoughtfully
inquiring whet!er, in the circumstalices auit
considering tie tribute lie constantly pays into
tihe public treasury as lie supplies hisi daily
wants, he receives his fair share of advantages.
There is also a suspicion abroad that the surÂ­
vlus of our rIevenues indicate abnormal and exÂ­
ceptional business profits, which, untider the sysÂ­
tenm wtlich proutces such surlpluss, increase will
out corresponding benefit to tile people at large.
The vast accumulations of a few among our citiÂ­
ens1, whllOse fortunes rival tile wealth of tile
most favored in anti-dellOcratle nations,
t:re not tile natural growth of ai
siatdy, plain and industrious ltepublic. Our
farmels, too ,and those.engaged directly and indiÂ­
rectly in slupplyitng the products of agrliculttre, see
that day by day, and as often as the daily wants
of their households recur, they are forced to pay
excessive and needless taxation, while their prodÂ­
nets struggle in foleign markets with the coluÂ­
petition of nations, which, by allowing a freer exÂ­
chlatge of productions than we pe'mit, enable
their people to sell for prices which distress the
American farmer. As every patriotic citizen reÂ­
j(ices in the constantly increasing pride of our
people in American citizenship anid in the glory
(o our national achievements andt progress a
sentiment prevails that tihe leadling strings, useÂ­
ful to a nation in its infancy, may well, to a great
extent, be discardett in tihe present stage of
American itgenuity, courage and fearless selfÂ­
reliance, and for the privilege of indulging this
sentiment with true American enthusiasm our
citizens are quite willing to forego an idle sur.Â­
plus in the public Treasury. All the people
ltnow that the average rate of Federnl taxation
upon inmports is to-day, in time of. peace, but
little less, while upon somnice articles of necesÂ­
sary consumption it is actually more, than
was imposed by the grievous burden willingly
borne at a time when the Government needed
tiillions to maintain by war tile safety and integÂ­
rity of the United States. It has been tile policy
of tile Governnmealt to collect the principal part
of its revenues by a tax upon Imports, anti no
change in this policy is desirable; but the presÂ­
ent condition of affairs constrains our people to
demand that, by a revision of our revenue laws,
the receipts of the Government shall be reÂ­
duced to the necessary expense of its economical
administration, and this demand shouldbe recogÂ­
nized and obeyed by the people's representatives
in the legislative branch of the Government,


SUDDEN READJUSTMENTS,
In readjusting the burdens of Federal taxaÂ­
tion a sound public !policy requires that such of
our citizens as have built up large and imporÂ­
tou. industries under present conditions, should
not be suddenly, and to their injury, deprived of
advantages to which they have adapted their
business; but, If the public good requires it, they
should be content with such consideration as
shall deal defairly and cautiously with their interÂ­
ests, while the just demand of the peoÂ­
ple for relief from needless taxation is honestly
answered. A reasonable and timely submission to
such a demand should certainly be possible withÂ­
out a disastrous shock to any interest, and a
cheerful concession sometimes averts abrupt and
heedless action-often the outgrowth of impoÂ­
tient and delayed justice. Due regard should hbe
also accorded on any proposed readjustument to
the interests of American labor, so far as they
aire involved.
THE WEALTH OF LABOR.
We congratulate ourselves that there is among
us no laboring class fixed within unyielding
bounds and doomed under all conditions to the
inexorable fate of daily toil. We recognize in laÂ­
bor a chief factor in the wealth of tie Republic
and we treat those who have it within
their keeping as citizens entitled to the most
careful regard and thoughtful attention. This
regard and attention should be awarded them
not only because labor is the canital of our workÂ­
inugian, justly entitled to its share of the GovÂ­
ernment's favor, but for the further and not less
imllortant reason that the laboring man, surÂ­
rounded by his family in his humble home, as a
consumer is vitally interested in all that
cheapens the cost of living anti enables him to
bring within his domestic circle additional coluÂ­
forts and advantages. This relation of the work-~
ingnlan to the revenue laws of the country
and the manner in which it palpably influences
tihe question of wages should not be forgotten ill
the justifiable prominence given to a proper
maintenaunce of the supply and protection of
well-paid labor, and these considerations suggest
such an arranlgement of the Government revÂ­
ennes as shall reduce the expense of living,
whilp it does not curtail the opportunity for
work, nor reduce the compensation of American
labor and injuriously affects its condition and
the dignified place it holds in the estimation of
our people.
But our farmers and agriculturists, those who
from the soil produce the thlins consumed by alt,
are perhaps more directly and plainly concerned
than any other of our citizens in a just and careÂ­
ul system of Federal taxation. Those actually
engaged in and more remotely connected withl
tlis kind of work numbers nearly one-half of
our population, and none labor harder or more
continuously than they. No enactments limit
theirhours of toil and no interposition of the
Government enhances, to any great extent, the
value of their products; and yet for many of the
necessaries and comfoits of lile which the most
scrupulous economy enables them to bring
into their homes, and for their implements of
husbandry, they are obliged to pay a price
largely increased by an unnatural profit, which,
by the action of the Government, is given to rile
lucre lfavred manuaacturer. I recommend that,
keeping in view all these considerations, the inÂ­
creasing and unnecessary surplus of national inÂ­
come annually accun-ulating be released to the
people by an anmendment to our revenue laws,
whlicl shall cheaoen tile price of the necessaries
oi life and give treer entrance to such imported

 materials as by American labor may be manÂ­
,factured into marketable comimodities.
Nothing can be accomplished, however, in
the direcliin of this much needed reform
Unless the subject is approached in a patriotic
spit o devotmonlo tl:e terests of the entire
colruntiy and willh a willinguess to yield someÂ­
illing for-the public good.
PUBLIC DEBT STATEMENT.
T1is sunl paid on the public debtduring the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1880,was$14,551,043.36. DurÂ­
ing the twelve months ended October 31, 1886, 3
per cent bonds were called for redemption
amounting to $127,283,100, of which $80,643,200
were so called to answer the requirements of
the 'law relating to the Sinking fund, and
$46,639,900 for the purpose of reducing the public
debt by the application of a part of the surplus
in the Treasury to that object. Of the bonds
thus called, $102,269 450 became subject to such
calls to redemption prior to NovemÂ­
her 1, 1886, The remainder amounting to
$25,013,650 matured under the calls after
that date. In addition to the amount,
subject .to payment and cancellation prior to
November 1st, there were also paid before that
day certain of these bonds with the interest
thereon, amounting to $5,073,555, which were in
anticipation, as to the unsturity of which
$2,C64,350 had not been calledÂ­ and thus
$167,341,800 had been actuallyapplied, prior to the
1st of November, 1886, to the exlingulshment of
our bonded and interest-bearing debt, leavingou
that day still outstanding the sum of $7,115,443,112.
Of this amount $86,848 700 were still represented
by 3 per cent bonds. 'They, however, have been
sitce November 14th, or at once will be, further
reduced by $32,806,150, being the bonds which
have been called, as already stated, but not reÂ­
deemed and cancelled before the tatter date.
SILVER COINAGIE.
During the fiscal year ended June 30,
1886, there were coined under the comÂ­
pulsory Silver Coinage Act of 1878, $29,Â­
858,849 in silver dollars and the cost of
the silver used in such coinage was $23,448.9n0 01.
There had been coined tp to hne close of the
previous fiscal year, under the provisions of thne
law, $203,882,554 In silver dollars, and on the 1st
dayof December, 1886, the total amount of such
coinage was $247,131,549. The Director of the
Mint reports that at the time of the
passage of the Act of 1878 directing this
coinage, the intrinsic value of the dollars thus
coined was 941/4 cents each, and that on the 31st
day of July, 1886, the price of silver reached the
lowest stage ever known. Also that the intrinsic
or bullion price of our standard silver.dollar at
that date was less than 72 cents. The price of
silver on the 30th of November last, was such as
to make the dollars inttinsically worth 18 cents
each. 'these differences in the value of the coins
represent the fluctuations of the price of silver and
they certainly do not indicate that compulsory
coinage by the Government enhances the price
of that comnmoi'iy or secures uniformity in its
statute.
Everyfairand legal effort has been made by
the Treasury Department to distribute this curÂ­
rency among the people. The withdrawal of
United States Treasury notes of small denominaÂ­
liou and the issuing of small silver certificates
have been resorted to in tile endeavor to accomÂ­
plishl this result. In obedience to the will and
sentiment of tile Representatives of the
pieople in Congress"" on the 27th day of
November, 1886, the people held these
coins or certificates representing the nominal
sum of $166,853,041 and we still have $79,464,345
in the Treasury, as against about 8142,891,055 in
the bands of the people and $72,865,376 remaining
in the Treasury one year ago. Tile Director
of the Mint again urges the necessity of more
vault room for.the purpose of storing the silver
dollars which are not needed. for circulation by
tie people.
I have seen no reason to changg the views exÂ­
pressed in my last annual message on the subject
of thlis compulsory coinage, and I again urge its
suspension on all the grounds contained m my
former recommnendation, re-enforced by the sigÂ­
nifleant increase of our gold exportations during
the last year. It appears by the comparative
statement, herewith presented, and for the furÂ­
tiher reasons, that the more thiscurrency is disÂ­
tributed among the people the greater becomes
our duty to protect it from disaster, that we
now have abundance for all our needs and that
there seems to be but little propriety in.huildin~
vaults to store such currency when the only preÂ­
tense for its coinagn is the necessity of its use by
the people as a circulating medium.
NEEDED REVENUE LAW AtIMENDMIENTS.
The great number of suits now pending in the
United States Courts for thie Southern district
of New York growing out of the collection of the
customs revenue at the port of New York, and
the number of such suits that are almost daily
instituted are certainly worthy the atÂ­
tention of Congress. The legal controÂ­
veisies which are based on conflicting
views by importers and tile Collector as
to the interpretation of our present
complexso and indefinite revenue laws, might be
;irgely obviatca by all amendment of those laws.
liut. pending suclh an amendment, time present
condition of this litigation should be relieved.
Tilere are now pending about two thousand live
unmidred of these suits, and more than one thouÂ­
sand one hundra d have been commenced within
tie past eighteen months, and many of the others
have been at issue for more than twenty-five
eats. These delays subject the Government to

these reveene litigations cannot be considered,


in default of the adoption by Congress of a
alan for the general reorganization of thte Federal
courts, as has been heretofore recommended, I
urge tihe propriety of passing a law permitting
the appointment of an additional Federal Judge
in tie district where these Government suits
have accumulated, so that by continued sesÂ­
sions of the courts devoted to the trial
of these cases they may be finally determined.
It Is entirely plain that a great saving to the GovÂ­

edy, and the suitors who have honest claims
would not be denied justice through delay.
WAR DEPARTMENT STATISTICS.
The report of the Secretary of War gives a dcÂ­
tailed account of the administration of his deÂ­
partment, and contains sundry recommendations
for the improvement of the service which I fully
apurove. The army consists at the
date of the last consolidated return of
2.1(3 ofllicers and 24.916 enlisted men.
The expenses of the depairtment for the last
fiscal year were $30,190,903 28, including $6,295,Â­
315 43 for public worki and river and harbor imÂ­
movements. I especiailly direct the attention of
Congress to the recommendation that officers be
required to submit to an examination as a preÂ­
lihninary to their proimotion. I see no objection
but malny advantages in adopting this feature,
which has operated so benelicial in our Navy
I)eparlmeut as well as in some branches of the
T'e subject of coast defenses and fortifications
has been fully and caretully Fteated by the
Board of Fortifications, whose report was subÂ­
mitted at the last session of Congress; but no
construction work of the kind reconummended by
the Board has been possible during the last year
from the laek of appropriations for such purÂ­
pose. The defenseless condition of our sea-coast
and lake frontier is perfectly palpable, and the
examinations made must convince us all that
certain of our cities named in the report of the
Board should be fortified and that work on the
n.ost important of these fortifications should be
commenced at once. The work has been
thloroughly considered and laid out, the SecreÂ­
tary of War reports, but all is delayed in doÂ­
fault of Congressional action. The absolute
necessity, judged by all standards of prudence
and foresiglt, of our preparation for an effectual
resistance against the armored ships and steel
puns of modern construction,which may threaten
the cities on our coasts, is so apparentthatIhope
effective steps will be taken in that direction insÂ­
inediately. The valuable and suggestive treatÂ­
ment of this question by the Board is earnestly
conimended to the conslderation of Congress,
In September and October last the hostile
Apaches who, under the leadership of Geronimo,
had for eighteen months been on the warpath,
mnd during that time had committed many murÂ­
tiers and been the cause of constant terror to the
settlers of Arizona, surrendered to Gen. Miles,
the military commander, who succeeded better
than Crook in the management and direction of
their pursuit. Under the terms of their surÂ­
render, as then reported, and in view of the unÂ­
derstanding which these mtulderous savages
seemed to entertain of the assurances
given them, it was considered best
to imprison them ill such manner
as to prevent their ever engaging in such outÂ­
rages again, Instead of trying them for murder,
Fort Picicens having been selected as a safe place
of confinement, all the adult males were sent
thither and will be closely guarded as prisoners.
In1 tihe mealtitne, tile residue of the band, who,
through still rematining upon the reservation,were
regarded as unsafe and were suspected of furÂ­
nishing aid to those on the warpath, had been reÂ­
moved to Fort Marion. Tihe women and larger
children of the hosliles were also taken thlre,
and arrangenments have been made for Dutting
tile children of proper age in Indian schools.
TIM NAVY DEPARTMFNTr.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy conÂ­
tains a detailed report of the condition of his deÂ­
parttment, with such a statement of the action
needed to improve the same as shoutld challenge
tue earlest attention of Congress. The present
navy of the United States, aside from the ships
in course of construction, consists first of
fourteen single-turreted monitors, none of which
are at the present time in serviceable condition.
Th'le batteries of these ships are obsolete and
they can only be relied upon as auxiliary ships
in iarbor defenses and then only after sneli
an expenditure upon them as might not be
oeerled justifiable. Second-Five fourthl-rate
vessels of small tonnage, only one of which was
designerd as a war vessel, and all of whlch are
auxiliary merely. Third-Twenty-seven cruisÂ­
ing ships, three of wiich are built of iron of
small tonnage and twenty-four of wood. Of these
wooden vessels it is estimated by the Chief ConÂ­
structor of the Navy that only three will be servÂ­
iceable beyond a period of six years, at which
time it may be said that of the present naval
force nothing worthy tire name will remain.
All the vessels heretofore ordered constructed
are under contract or in course of construction
except the arnmored ships the torpedo and
dynamite boats, and one cruiser."" As to the last
of these, the bids were in excess of the limits
lixed byCongress. Tile production in tihe United
States of armor and guns of steel is a question
which it seems necessary to settle at an early
day, if the armored war vessels are to be comnÂ­
pleted with materials of home manufacture. Tlis
has been the subject of investigation by two speÂ­
cial committees of Congress within the last three
years, The report of the Foundry Board in 1884,
of the Board on Fortifications made in January
last and the report of the select committee of the
two Houses made at the last session of Congress
have entirely exhausted the subject so far as
prelirminarv investigation is involved and in
their recolimendations they substantially agree,
In the event that the present invitation of the
Idepartment for bids to furnish, such of this
material as is now authorized shall
fail to induce domestic mnatfacturers to
undertake the large expenditures requiredl
to prepare for tills new manufacture,
and nio otller steps are taken by Congress at Its
emning session, tile Secretary contemplated witi
cisalfection the necessity o1 obtaining abroad
tire armnors and thie gun steel for the authorizea
ships. It would seem desirable that tlle wants
of the army and navyin this regard slhould be
reasonably met, and that by unitingthe contracts
sucni inducement tnight be offeredt that would reÂ­
suit in securing the ldomestication of these imÂ­
l:ortant interests.


THE POSTAL SERVICE.
The affairs of the Postal Service show marked
and gratifying improvement during the past
year. A particular account of its transactions
and condition is given in tile report of the PostÂ­
master-General, which will be laid before you.
The reduction of the rate of letter postage in
183, renaering the postal revenues inadequate
to sustain the expenditures and the business
depression also contributing, resulted in an exÂ­
cess of the cost for the fiscal year ended June
30,1885, of eight and one-third millions of dolÂ­
lars. An additional check upon receipts, by
doubling the measure of weight in rating sealed
correspondence and diminishing one-half the
charge for newspapers carriage, was imposed
by legislation, iwhich took effect with the
beginniug of the past fiscal year, While the
constant demant of our territorial development
and growing populatiuu for the extension and inÂ­
crease of mail facilities and nmachlieryuecessiÂ­
lated a steadv annual advance in outlays, and the
careful estimate of a year ago upon the rates of
expenditure then existing contemplated the unÂ­
avoidable augmentation of the deficiency in the
last fiscal year by nearly $2,000,000, the anticiÂ­
pated revenue for the last year failed of realizaÂ­
tion by about $t4,000; but proper measures
of economy have satisfactorily limited the
growth of expenditure that the total defiÂ­
ciency in fact, fell below that of 1885,
and at this time the increase of revenue is gainÂ­
ing over the increase of cost, demonstrating the
sufficiency of the present rates of postage ultiÂ­
mately to sustain the service. This is tile more
pleasing because our people enjoy now both
cheaper postages proportionately to distances,
and a vaster and more costly service than any
other on the globe. Retrenchment has been
effected in the cost of supplies, the sole exÂ­
penditures unwarranted by law have ceasea
and the outlays for mail carriage have been
subjected to beneficial scrutiny. At the close
of the last fiscal year the expense
of transportation on Star routes stood to at.anÂ­
nual rate of cost less by over $500,000 than at the
close of the previous year, and steamboat and
mail messenger service at nearly $200,000 less.
The service has been in the meantlimne enlarged
and extended by the establishment of new otiiÂ­
ces, thie increase of routes of carriage, expansion

 of ca rrie rdelivery conveniences and additions to
the railway mail facilities, In accordance with
tihe growing exigencies of the country and the
long-established policy of the Government.
Tile Postmaster-General calls attention to
the existing law for compensatihg railroads,
and expresses the opinion that a method may
be devised whttlh will prove more just to the
carriersand belietlial to the Government, and
the subject appears worthy of your early consitÂ­
eration. The differences which arose during the
year with certain of the steamship companies
have terminated by the acquiescence of all in
the policy of the Government, and the departÂ­
ment now enjoys the utmost service afforded by
all vessels which sail from our ports upon
either ocean, a service generally adeÂ­
quate to the needs of our intercourse.
Petitions have, however, been preÂ­
sented to the department by numerous merÂ­
chants and manufacturers for the establishment
of a direct servide to the Argentine Republie
and for semi-monthly dispatches to the Empire
of Brazil, and the objects are commended to your
consideraton. It is an obvious duty to provide
the means of postal communication wineh our
commerce requires, and which a prudent foreÂ­
cast of results approves. The wise extension of
it may lead to a - stimulating intercourse and
become the harbinger of a profitable
traffle, which will open new avenues for
the disposition of the. products of our
industry. The circumstance of the conuÂ­
tries at the far south of our Continent are
such as to invite our enterprise, and afford the
promise of sufficient advantages to justify an unÂ­
tisualeffolttto bring about the closer relations
which greater freedom of communication would
establish. I suggest that, as distinguished from a
grant or subsidy, tor the mere benelit of any line
of trade or travel, whatever outlay may be reÂ­
quired to secure additional postal service necesÂ­
Sary and proper, and not otherwise attainable,
should be regarded as within the limnit
of legitimate compensation for such servÂ­
ice, The extension of the free delivery service,
as suggested by the Postmaster-General, has
lteretofore received my sanction, and it is to be
hoped a suitable enactment may soon be agreed
upon. The request for an appropriation sLfliÂ­
clent to enable the general inspection of fourthÂ­
class offices, has my approbation. I renew my
approval of the recommendation of the PostmasÂ­
ter-General, that another Assistant be provided
for the Postoflice Departlment; and I invite your
attention to the several other recommendations
in his report.
DEPAITIENT OF JUSTICE.
The conduct of the Department of Justice for
the last fiscal year, is fully detailed in thie reÂ­
port of the Attorney-General, and I invite the
earnest attention of Congress to the same, and
due consideration of tile recommendations
therein contained. In the report submitted by
tis officer to the last session of the Congress he
strongly recommended the erection of a peniÂ­
tentiary for the confnlement of prisoners conÂ­
victed and sentenced in the United States Courts,
anti he repeats the recommendation in this reÂ­
I)ort for tue last year. This is a macter of very
great importance, and should at once receive
Cougressional action, United States prisoners
are now confined in more than thirty difÂ­
ferent State prisons andl penitentiaries, situated
iln every part of the country. They are
subjected to nearly as many different modes of
treatment anat discipline, and are far too much
removed from the control and regulation of the
Government. So faras theyare entitled tohuÂ­
mane treatment and opportunity for improveÂ­
ment and reformation, the Government is reÂ­
sponstile to them and society that these things
are fortlicoming; but this deity can scarcely be
discharged without more absolute control and
discretion. than is possible under the present
systemn. Many of of or good citizens have interÂ­
ested themselves with the best beneficial results
on the question of prison reformu. The
General Government!should be in a situation,
since there must be United States prisoners, to
furnish imnnportant aid in tills movement, and
should be able toillustrate what may be practicÂ­
ally done in the direetion of this reform, and to
present an example in the treatment and imÂ­
provements of its prisoners worthy of imitation.
With prisons under its own control the GovernÂ­
mnent could deal with the somewhat vexed quesÂ­
tion of convict labor, so far as its convicts were
concerned, according to a plan of its own adopÂ­
tion and with due regards of tie rights altl interÂ­
ests of our laboring eitizens, instead of
someltimes aiding in the operation of
a system which causes among them irritation and
discontent. On the consideration of this subject
it might be thought wise to erect more than one
of these institutions, located in such places as
would best subserve the purpose of convenience
and econlomy in transportation. The considerÂ­
able cost of maintaining these convicts as at
present in State institutions would be saved by
the adoption of the plan proposed, and by emÂ­
ploying them in thile manufacturing of such artiÂ­
cles as were needea for use by the Governtent,
quite a large pecuniary benefit would be realized
in partial retut n for itse outlay.
I again urge a clhange in the Federal judicial
system to meet the wants of the people and obÂ­
viate the delays necessarily attending the presÂ­
ent condition of affairs in our courts. All are
aereed that something should be done, and much
favor is shown by those well able to advise, to
the plan suggested by the Attorney-General at
tile last session of Congress, and recommended
in my last annual message. This recommendaÂ­
tion is here renewed, together with another
made at the same time touching a change in the
manner of compensating District Attorneys and
Iarshlials, and tlie latter subject is commended
to Congress for its action in the interest of econÂ­
omy to the Government and humanity, fairness
and justice to our people.
THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF TIff INÂ­
TERIOR.
The report of the Secretary of tie Interior pre
seats a comprehensive sumnary of tile work of
the various branches o1 the public service conÂ­
uected with hIis department, and the suggestions
and recommendations which it contains for the
imlprovement of thle service should receive your
careftl cousideration, Tice exhibit made of
the condition of our Indian popalation and tihe
prcgress of the work for their enlightenÂ­
Uaent, notwithtanding tile elbarrassments


~hlicll hinder the better administration of
this important branch of the service,
is a gratifying and hopeful one. Tie
funts appropr'iated for the Indian service for
the fiscal year just passed, with the available
income from Indian land and trust moneys,
amounting in all to $7,850,77512, were ample for
the service under the conditions and restrictions
of laws regulating their expenditures. Tnere
remained a balance on hlland on June 30, 1886, of
$1,860,t2330, of which $1,337.76321 are permaÂ­
nent funds for fulfillment of treaties and
other like purposes, and the remainder,
$322,2515 0, is subject to be carried to
the Surplus fund, as required by law. The estiÂ­
mates presented for appropriations for the ensu.
ing fiscal year amount to $5,618,87364, or
$442,306 20 less than those laid before Congress
last year. The present system of agencies,
while absolutely necessary and well-adapted for
the management of our Iudian affairs and for the
ends in view when it was adopted, is, in the
present stage of Indian management, inadeÂ­
quate, standttng alone, for the accomplishment of
an object vwhicli has become pressing in its imÂ­
portance, the more rapid transition from triÂ­
bal organizations to citizenship of such
portions of the Indians as areinoeapable of aivilÂ­
ized life. When the existing system was adopted,
the Indian race were outsiae the limits of organ.
ized States and Territories, and beyond the
immediate reach and operation of civilization,
and all eflorts were mainly directed to the mainÂ­
taunence of friendly relations, and the preservaÂ­
tion of peace and quietof the frontier. All this
is now changed, There is no such thing as the
Indian frontier. Civilization, with the busy
l:un of industry and the influence of
Clhristianity, surrounds these people at every
point. None of the tribes are outside of the
bounds of organized government and society,
except that the Territorial systenm has not been
extended over thatportion of the country inown
as Indian Territory. As a race the Indians are no
longer hostile, but may be considered as subunisÂ­
sive to tile control of the Government, as few of
them are troublesome. Except the fragment of
several bands, all are now gathered upon reserÂ­
vations. It is no longer possible for them to subÂ­
sist by the chase and the spontaneous proctucÂ­
tlons of nature. With an abundance of land,
if furnisBed with the means and Iml.tements for
profitable husbandry, their life of entire dependÂ­
ence upon Government rations from day to day
is no longer defensible. Their inclinations, long
fostered by a defective system of control, is to
clingto tihe habits and customs of their ancesÂ­
tors, and struggle with persistence against the
change of life which their altered circumstances
press upon them; but barbarism and civilizaÂ­
tion cannot live together, It is impossible
that such inconmrtous conditions sifould co-exist
on the same soil. They are a portion of our peoÂ­
ple, are under the authiority of our Government,
and have a peculiar claim upon, and are entitled
to the fostering care and protection of the naÂ­
tion. Tile Government cannot relieve itself of
this responsibility until they are so far trained
and civilized as to be able wholly to manage and
care for thlemselves. Tile path in which they
should walk must be clearly marked out for tlletii,
and they must be led or guided until t'cey
are familiar with the way uand competent
to assume the duties atlt responsibilities of citiÂ­
zenship. The progress of this great work will
crontinue only at the present slow pace and at
great expense, unless the system and methods
of management are inlprbved to meet the
changed conditions antd urgent demands of the
service. The agents having general charge and
supervision, in many cases of more than live
tl.onsand Indians, scattered over large reserÂ­
vatluns and burdened with the details of acÂ­
countability for funds and supplies, have time to
look after the industrial training and imÂ­
provement of a few Indians only; the
many are neglected and remain idle and in
depelndent conditions, not favorable for progress
in civilization. The compensation allowed these
agents and the conditions of the service are not
calculated to secure the workmen who are lifted
by ability and rkill to properly plan and intelliÂ­
gently direct the methods best adapted to proÂ­
duce the most speedy results and permanent
benefits. Hence the necessity for a suppleÂ­
m ental agency or system, directed to tlhe end of
promoting the general and more rapid transition
of tribes from habits and custonms of bartarity to
the ways of civilization. With an ani.ous deÂ­
sire to devise some plan of operalion by
which to securethe welfare of the Indians audito
relieve tile Treasury, so far as possible, from the
support of an idle and dependent population, I reeÂ­
onumended in my previous annual message thle
passage of a law authorizing the appointment of
a Comimmission as an instrumentality auxiliary
to those already established for the care of the
Indians. It was designed that this Commission
should be composed of six intelligent and capable
persons, three to be detailed from tile army,
having practical ideas uplon tie subject
of the treatment -of Indians. and interÂ­
ested in their welfare, and that it should
be charged, under the direction of the Secretary
of the Interior, with the management of such
matters of details as camnot, with the present
organlzation, be properly and successfully conÂ­
ducted, and which present different phases as
the Indians themselves differ in their progress,
disposition and capacity for improvement or inmÂ­
nmediate sell-support. By the aid of such ConsÂ­
mission much unwise and useless expenditure of
money, waste of materials and unavailing efforts
might be avoided, and it is hoped that this, or
some measure which the wisdom of Congress
may better devise to supply the deficiency of the
present system, may receive your consideration
and the appropriate legislation be provided.
The time is ripe for the work of such an agency.
There is less opposition to the education and
training of the Indian youth, as shown by the
increased attendance upon tihe schools, andthere
is a yielding tendency for the individual holding
of lands. Development and advancement in
these directions are essential and should have
every eneoPurawrenlP. t. A r thP ri5inrn n,n,ri-,,


are taught tile language of civiliiatloni and
trained in habits of industry, they should
assume tie duties, privileges and responsibiliÂ­
ties of citizenship. No obstacles should hinder
the location and settlement of any Indian willing
to.take land in severalty. On the contrary, the
inclination to do so should be stimulated at all
times by proper expedients. But there is no
authority of law for making allotments on some
of the reservations, and on others the allotments
provided for are so small that the Indians,
Though ready and desiring to settle down,
are not willing to accept such small areas
when their reservations contain ample lands
to afford them homesteads of suflicient
size to meet their present and future needs.
These inequalities of existing s~eeial laws
a'd treaties sl;ould be corrected anal some genÂ­
eral legislation on the subject should be proÂ­
vided so that the more progressive members of
the different tribes may be settled upon homeÂ­
steads and by their example teach others to folÂ­
low-breaking away from tribal customs and
substituting therefor the love of home, the inÂ­
terest of the family and the wle. The Indian
character and nature are such that they are not
easily led while brooding over unadjustedwrongs.
This is especially so regarding their lands. 1MatÂ­
ters arising from the construction and operation
of railroads across some of the reservations
and claims of title and right of occupancy set up
by white persons to some of the best land within
other reservation require legislation for their
final adjustment, The settlement of these matÂ­
ters will remove many embarrassments to progÂ­
ress in the work of leading the Indians to the
adoplion of our institutions, and bringing them
under the operation, the influence and the pro.
â€¢teelion of the universal laws of our country.
THE PUBLIC DOMAIX,
The recommendations of the Secretary of the
interior and of the Commissioner of the GenÂ­
eral Land Office, looking to the better protection
of publie lands and of the public surveys; the
Preservation of nationa' forests,-the adjudication
of grants to States and corporations and of priÂ­
vate land claims and the increased efficiency of
the public service are commendedlo the attenÂ­
tion of Congress. To secure the widest distribuÂ­
tion of public land and thus make the greatest
number of individual homes was the primary obÂ­
ject of the public land legislation in the early
days of the Republic. This system was
a simple one. It provided that the iunmÂ­
blest citizen could identify the tract upon

 which lie wished to establish his home, and the
price of lands was placed within the reach of all
the enterprising, industrious and honest pioneer
cltizels of the country. It was soon, however.
found That the object of the laws was perverted,
under the system of cash sales, from a distribuÂ­
tion of land among the people to an accumulaÂ­
tion of land capitalby wealthy and speculative
persons. To check this tendency a preferende
right of purchase was given to settlers
on the land, a plan which culminated
in the general Pre emption Act of
1841. The fonundation or this system
was actual residence and cultivation. Twenty
years later the Homestead laws, devised to more
surely place actual homes in the possession of
actual cultivators of the soil, were passed. The
land was given without price, the sole conditions
being residence, improvement and cultivation.
Other laws have followed, each designed to enÂ­
courage the acquirement and useof land in limÂ­
ited individual quantities. But in later years
these laws, through vicious administrative methÂ­
ods and under changedconditions of communica.
lion and transportation, have neen so evaded and
violated that their beneficent purpose is
threatened, with entire defeat. The
methods of such evasions and violations
are set forth in detail in the reports of the SecÂ­
retalry of the Interior and the Commissioner of
the General Land Office. The. rapid appropriaÂ­
tion (""f our public lands without bona floe settleÂ­
ments or cultivation, and not only without intenÂ­
tion of residence, but for the purpose of their agÂ­
gregation in large holdings-in many cases in the
bands of foreigners-invites the serious and imÂ­
mediate attention of Congress. The energies of
the Land Department have been devoted, during
the present Administration, to remedying defects
and correcting abuses in the public land service.
The results of these efforts are so largely
in the nature of reforms in the process and the
methods of our land system as to prevent adeÂ­
quate estimates, but it appears by a compilation
Ilom the reports of the Commissioner of toe GunÂ­
elal Laud Office that ithe immediate effect in
leaoing cases which have come to a linal terminÂ­
ation has been the restoration to the luass of
public lands of 2,750,000, and 2,370,000 acres are elÂ­
braced in investigations now pending before
the department or in the courts. AcÂ­
lion by. Congress hlis been asked to
effect the restoration of 2,790,000acres additional,
besides which 4,000,000 acl es have been withheld
for reservation and the rights of entry thereon
maintained. I recommend the repeal of the PreÂ­
emption and Timber Culture Acts and that tile
Homestead laws be so amended as to better seÂ­
cure compliance with, and cultivation for the peÂ­
riod of live years from data of entry, withoutt
counmutation or provision for speculative relinÂ­
oiishment. I also recommend the repeal of the
Desert Land laws, unless it shall be
the plesure of Congress to so amend
these laws, as to render them less liable to abuse.
As the chief motive for the evasion of the laws
and the principle cause -of this result in land
distribution is the facility with which transfers
are made of the right intended to be secured to
settlers, it may be deemed advisable to provide,
by legislation, some guards and checks upon the
alienation of vested rights and lands covered
thereby until the patents issue. Last year an
Executive proclamation was issued, directing the
removal of fences which inclosed the public
domain, and nmany of these have been removed in
obedience to such order, but much of the public
land still remains within the lines of the unlaw-""
ful fences. The Ingenious methods resorted to
in order to contrive these trespasses, and the
hardihood of the pretenses by which, in some
cases, such inclosures are justified, are fully deÂ­
tailed in the report of the Secretary of the IiÂ­
terior. The removal of the fences still remainÂ­
ing, which inclose public lands, will be enforced
whit all the authority and means with which the
Executive branch of the Goverment is or shall
be invested by Congress for that purpose.
THE PENSION BUREAU.
The report of tile Commisstoner of Pensions
gives a detailed and most satisfactory exhibit of
the operations of the Pension Bureau. During
the last fiscal year the amount of work done was
tihe largest in any year since the organization of
the bureau, and it has been done at less cost
than during the previous year in every division.
On the 38th day of June, 1886, there were 365,763
pensioners on the rolls of the bureau. Since
1861 there have been 1,018,735 applications tor
pensionsfiled, of which 8,834 were basea upon
service in the War of 1812. There were 621,754
of sahese applications allowed, including 6.172 to
the soldiers of 1812 and their widows. The total
amount paid for pensions since the War
of 1812 is $808,024,81157. The number
of new pensions allowed during the year
ended June 30, 1886, is 40,857; a larger number
than has been allowed in any year save one since
18ti1. The names of 2,229 pensioners which had
been previously dropped from tile rolls, were reÂ­
stored ouring the year, and after deducting those
dropped within the same time for various causes,
an increase remains for the year of 20,058
ualiles. From January 1, 1861, to December 1,
1885, 1,958 private pensions acts have been passed.
Since the last mentioned date and during
tile lart session of Congress, 614 such Acts
became .laws. It seems
. to me that
no one can examine our pension esÂ­
tablishment and its operations without
being colnvitced thatthrough its instrumentality
justice can be very nearly done to all who are.
â€¢entitled under present laws to the pension bounty
of the Government. But it is undeniable tlhat
eases exist well-entitled to relief, in which the
Pension Bureau Is powerless to relieve. The
really worthy cases of this class are such as only
lack by misfortune the kind or quantity of proof
which the law ant regulations of the bureau reÂ­
quire, or which, though their merit is apparent,
for some other reason cannotbe justly dealt with
through general laws. These conditions fully
justify application to Congess and special enactÂ­
inent, But resort to Gongress for a special
Pt asion Act to overrile the deliberate and careÂ­


ful determination of the Pension Bureau on the
merits of the case, or to secure favorable action
when it could not be expected under the most
liberal execution of general laws. it must be adÂ­

by sentiment and patriotic feeling that
trey are hard to resist. I suppose
it will not be denied that many claims
for pensions are made witlho..t merit, and
mat many have been allowed on fraudtulent repÂ­
resentations. This has been declared from the
Pension Bureau, not only in this but in prior Ad.
ministrations, The usefulness and the justice of
any system for the distribution of pensions deÂ­
lpend on the equality and uniformity of its operaÂ­
tion. It will be seen from the report of the ComÂ­
missioner that there are now paid by
the Government 131 different rates of pension
Estimates from the best information Ihe call
obtai that 0,010 of those'who hIae h ived in the
army and navy of the United States are now
supported in whole or in part from public funds
or by organized charities exclusive of those in
soldier homes, under the direction and control of
tlhe Government. Only 13 per cent of these are
pensioners, while of the entire number of men
furnished for the late war, something like 20
per cent, lunluding tneir widows and relations,
have been or are n1ow in the receipt of penÂ­
sions. The American people, with a patriotic,
grateful reward for our ex-soldiers too broad and
too sacred to be monopolized.by any special adÂ­
vocates, are not only willing, but anxious that
equal aud exact justice should be done to all
honest claims; and for pensions. ia their sight,
the friendless and destitute soldier, dependent
upon public clharity, if otherwise entitled, has
precisely the same right to share in the provision
made for those who fought their country's battle
as those better able, through friends and influÂ­
ence, to push their claims. Every pension that
is granted under our present plan uponl
any other grounds than actual service, injury
or disease incurret in such service, aucevery

creased on other grounds than the mieritt of the
claim, work an injustice to the brave and the
elippleed but poor and friendless soldier who is
entirely vireglected, or who must be content with
the snle Â·r sum allowdd under general laws.

A Small-Fox Remedy.
A correspondent of the Stockton (Cal

ifornia) Herald writes as follows :

1 herewith append a recipe which has

been used to my knowledge in hundreds

of cases. It will prevent or cure the
small-pox, though the pittings are filling.

vvnen Jenner discovered cow-pox in
England, the world of science hurled an

avalanche of fame upon his head, but

when the most scientific school of mediÂ­
cine in the world, that of Paris, pub

lished this recipe as a panacea tor small

pox, it passed unheeded, it is as un

failing as fate, and conquers in every

instance. It is harmless when taken by
a well person. It will also cure scarlet

fever. Here is the recipe as I have used

it, and cured my children of scarlet-

fever; here it is as I have used it

to cure the small-pox: when learned

physicians said the patient must die it

cured : sulphate of zinc, one grain ; fox

glove, (digitalis), one grain ; half a tea-

spoonful of sugar ; mix with two table-

spoontuls ot water. When thoroughly
mixed add four ounces of water. Take

SDOonful everv hour. Either disease

will disappear in twelve houis. or a

child smaller doses, according to age.

If counties would compel their physiÂ­
cians to use this there would be no need
of pest-houses. If you value advice and
experience, use this for that terrible

disease.

fNoTE to the Editok.1 If anv more

than the above is needed, I would say

that I have a friend who knows of the

above recipe being used in a number of

cases in Cincinnati and vicinity, one
case, a very bad one it was supposed

the patient would die. The result was

exactly as stated. J. D. L., Covington,

EE-IXVESTIGATED.
Remarkable Statement Fully ConÂ­
firmed by Three Important
Interviews.
An unusual article from the Rochester
(N. Y.) Democrat and Chronicle was pubÂ­
lished in this paper recently and has been
the subject of much conversation both in
professional circles and on the street.
Apparently it caused more commotion in
Rochester, as the following from the same
paper shows :
Dr. J. B. Henion. who is well known not
only in Rochester, but in nearly every part
of America, sent an extended article to
this paper, a few days since, which was
duly published, detailing his remarkable
experience and rescue from what seemed
to be certain death. It would be imposÂ­
sible to enumerate the personal enquiries
which have been made at our office as to
the validity of tho article, but they have
been so numerous that further investigaÂ­
tion of the subject was deemed an editorial
necessity.
With this end in view a representative of
this paper called on Dr. Henion at his
residence, when tho following interview
occurred :
44 That article of yours, doctor, has
created quite a whirlwind. Are the stateÂ­
ments about the terrible condition you
were in, and the way vou were rescued,
such as you can sustain?""
""Everyone of them and many additional
ones. Few people ever get so near the
grave as I did and then return, and I am
not surprised that the public think it marÂ­
velous. It was marvelous.""
""How in the world did you, a physician
come to be brought so low?""
4'By neglecting the first and most simplo
symptoms. I did not think I was sick. It
is true I had frequent headaches ; felt tired
most of the time; could eat nothing one
day and was ravenous the next; felt dull;
indefinite pains, and my stomach was out
of order, but I did not taints iff mean-anything
serious."" J a "" ""
""But have these common ailments anyÂ­
thing to do-with the ,fariul Bright'a
disease which took so . firm a hold on
you?""
"" Anything? Why, they are the sure inÂ­
dications of the first stages df that dreadÂ­
ful malady. The fact is, few people know
or realize what ails them, and I am sorry
to say that too few physicians do either.""
""That is a strange statement, doctor.""
""But it is a true one. The medical proÂ­
fession have been treating symptoms inÂ­
stead of diseases for years, and it is high
time it ceased. We doctors have been
clipping off the twigs when we should
strike at the root. The symptoms I have.
jr$t mentioned or any unusual action or
irritation of the water channels indicate
the approach of Bright's disease even more
than a cough announces the coming of
consumption. We do not treat the cough,
but try to help the lungs. We should not
waste our time trying to relieve the headÂ­
ache, stomach, pains about the body or
other symptoms, but go directly to the kidÂ­
nevs, the source of most of theseailments.""
""This,, then, is what you meant when
you said more than one-half the deaths
which occur arise from Bright'a disease, is
it, doctor?""
""Precisely. Thousands ot so-called disÂ­
eases are torturing peophs to-day, when in
reality it is Bright's disease in some one of
its many forms. It is a Hydra-headed
monster and the slightest symptoms should
strike terror to every oue who has them. I
can look back and recall hundreds- of
deaths which physicians declared at the
time were- caused by paralysis, apoplexy,
heart-disease, pneumonia, malarial fever
and other common complaints which I see
now were caused'by Bright's disease.""
44 And did all these cases have simple
symptoms at first?"" . , .
44 Every one of them, . asd might hava
been cured as I Was by the timely uso of
the same remedy Warner's Safe Cure. I
am getting my eyes thoroughly open in
this matter and think I am helping other
to see the fact""? and their possible danger
also. Why, there are no end of truths
bearing o this subject. If you want to
know more about it go and see Mr. Warner
himself. He was sick the same as I, and
is the healthiest man in Rochester to-day.
He has made a study of this subject and
can give you more facts than I can. Go,
too, and see Dr. Lattimore, the chemist, at
the University. If you want facts there
are any quantity of them showing the
alarming increase of Bright's disease, its
simple and deceptive symptoms, and there
is but one wavby which it can be escaped.""
Fully satisfied of the truth and force of
the Doctor's words, the reporter bade him
good day and called on Mr. Warner at his
establishment on Exchange street. At first
Mr. Warner was inclined to be reticent,
but learning tlrat the information desired
was about the alarming increase of Bright's
disease, his manner changed instantly and
he snoke very earnestly :

"" It is true that Bright's disease has la
creased wonderfully, and we find, by reliaÂ­
ble statistics, that in the past ten yean its
growth has been 250 per cent. Look at the
prominent men it has carried off: Everett,
Sumner, Chase, Wilson, Carpenter, Bishops
Haven and Peck, and others. This is terÂ­
rible, and shows a greater- growth than
that of any other known complaint. It
should be plain to every one that someÂ­
thing must be done to check this increase
or there is no knowing where it may end.""
"" Do you think many people are afflicted
with it to-day : who do not iealize it, Mr.
Warner?"" j V ' '. .-
44 Hundreds of thousands. I have a strikÂ­
ing example of this truth which has just
come to my notice. A prominent professor
in a New Orleans medical college was lectÂ­
uring before his class on the subject of
Bright's disease. He had various .-; fluids
under microscopic analysis, and was showÂ­
ing the students what the indications of
this ' terrible malady, were. In order, to
show the contrast between healthy and
unhealthy fluids, he had provided a vial,
the contents of which were drawn from
his own person. 4 And now, gentlemen,'
he eaid, 4 as we have seen the unhealthy inÂ­
dications, I will show you how it appears
in a state of perfect health, ',and he. subÂ­
mitted his own fluid to the usual test. As
he watched 'the results his countenance
suddenly changed his color and comÂ­
mand both left him, and in a trembling
voice he said: 4 Gentlemen, I have made a
painful discovery ; have Bright's disease
of the kidneys,' and in less than a year he
was dead."" t,
44 You believe, thenj that it has no sympÂ­
toms of its own and is frequently unknown
even by the person who is afflicted with it?""
44 It has no symptoms of its own and very
often none at all. Usually no two people
have the same symptoms, and frequently
death is the first symptom. The slightest inÂ­
dication of anvkidnev difficnltv should be

enough to strike terror to any pne. . J tnow

through all -the stages of kidney disease, '&
44 You know of Dr. Henion's case?""
44 Yes, I have both read and heard of it.""
44 It is very wonderful, is it not ?""
44 A very prominent case, but no more so
than a great many others that have come
to my notice as having .been cured by the
same means."" -
44 You believe then that Bright's disease
can be cured?""
44 1 know it can. I know it from the exÂ­
perience of hundreds of prominent persons
who were given up. to die by both their phyÂ­
sicians and friends.""
You speak of your own experience.
What was it?"" : '
44 A fearful one. I had felt languid and
unfitted for business for years. But I did
not know what ailed me. When, however,
I found it was kidney difficulty I tt ought
there was little hope, and so did the docÂ­
tors. I have since learned that one of the
physicians of this city pointed me out to
a gentleman on the street one day, say ing:
4 there goes a mau who will ba dead within
a' year.' I believe his words would have
proven true if I had not fortunately seÂ­
cured and used the remedy now known as
Warner's Safe Cure.""
44 And this caused youtomanafacture it?""
44 No it caused me to investigate. I went
to the principal cities, saw physicians' preÂ­
scribing and using it and I therefore de
termined, as a duty I owed humanity and
the suffering, to bring it within their reach
and now it is known in every part of AmerÂ­
ica, is sold in every drug store and has beÂ­
come a household necessity.""
The reporter left Mr. Warner, much imÂ­
pressed with the earnestness and sincerity
of his statements and next paid a visit to
Dr. S. A. Lattimore at his residence on
Prince street. Dr. Lattiniore, although
busily engaged upon some matters conÂ­
nected with the State Board of Health, of
whibh he is dne of the analysts, courteously
answered the questions that were proÂ­
pounded h&n: -
44 Did you make a chemical analysis of the
case of Mr. H. H. Warner some three years
ago. Doctor?"" . ,
""Yes, sir."" f
""What did this analysis show you?""
44 The presence of albumen andltube casts
in great abundance."" - . . .
""And what did the symptoms indicate?""
""A serious disease of the kidneys."" r
Did you think Mr. Warner could 'reÂ­
cover?"" :.. .
""No, sir. I did not think it possible. It
was seldom, indeed, that so pronounced a
case had, up to that time, ever been
cured.""
""Do you know anything about the remÂ­
edy which cured him?""
'""'Yes, I have chemically analyzed it, and
upon critical examination find it entirely
free from any poisonous or deleterious subÂ­
stances.""We publish the foregoing statements in
view of the commotion which the publicity
of Dr. Henion's article has caused, and to
meet the protestations which have been
made. The standing of Dr. Henion, Mr.
Warner and Dr. Lattimore in the commuÂ­
nity is leyond question, and the stateÂ­
ments they make can not for a moment be
doubted. ""They conclusively show that
Bright's disease of the kidneys is one of
the most deceptive and dangerous of all
.diseases, that it is exceedingljr common,
alarmingly increasing, and that it can be
cured.

who founded our holy religion not that I would
liken this to it, or bring any comparison, for I am
not going to detain you long. But, gentlemen,
I came into power under the Constitution of the
country and by the approbation of the people.
And what did I find? I found eight millions of
people who were in fact condemned under the law,
and the penalty was death. Under the idea of
revenge and resentment they were to be annihilaÂ­
ted and destroyed. O, how different this from
the example set by the holy founder of our reliÂ­
gion, whose divine arm touches the horizon and
embraces the whole earth. Yes, He who founded
this great scheme came into the world and found
our race condemued under the law, aud the senÂ­
tence was death. What was His example? InÂ­
stead of putting the world or a nation to death,
He went forth with grace and attested by His
blood and His wounds that Ho would die and
let the nation live. Let them repent, and let
them acknowledge their allegiance ; let them
become loyal and willing supporters and deÂ­
defenders of our glorious "" stiipes and stars ""and
the Constitution of our country ; let their leaders,
the conscious, intelligent traitors, suffer the penÂ­
alty of the law, but for the great mass, who havo
been forced into this rebellion and misled by their
leaders, I say, leniency, kindness, trust and confiÂ­
dence. Enthusiastic cheers.
THE SECOND REBELLION.
But, my countrymen, after having passed
through the rebellion, and given such evidence as
I have though men croak a great deal about it
now laughter) when I look back through the
battle-fields and see many of these brave men, in
whose company I was, in localities where the conÂ­
test was most difficult and doubtful, before the
smoke of battle has scarcely passed away, before
the blood shed has scarcely congealed, what do
wc find ? The rebellion is put down by the strong
arm of the government in the field ; but is that
the only way in which wo can have rebelion ?
They struggled for the breaking up of your govÂ­
ernment, but before they uro scarcely out of the
battle field, and before our brave men have scarcely
returned to their homes, to renew the ties of afÂ­
fection and love, wo find ourselves almost in the
midst of aucther rebellion. Applause. The
war to suppress one rebellion was to prevent the
separation of the States, to prevent them from
flying off, and thereby changing the character of
the government, and weakening its power. Now
what is the struggle ? There is an attempt to
concentrate the power of tho government in the
hands of the few, and thereby bring about a conÂ­
solidation which is equallv dancrerous and objec
tionable with separation. Enthusiastic applause.
We find that powers are assumed and attempted to
be exercised of a most extraordinary character.
What are they ?
THE REVEIUTlONAKY ACTION OF TUE RADICALS IN
CONGRESS.
We find that Governments can be revolutionized,
can be changed, without going into the battleÂ­
field. Sometimes revolutions, the most disastrous
to tho people, are effected without the shedding of
blood. The substance of government may be taÂ­
ken away, while the form and shadow is still adÂ­
hered to. Now, what are the attempts ? What is
being proposed ? We find that, in fact, by an ir
responsible, central directory, nearly all the powÂ­
ers of Government are assumed, without even
consulting the legislative or executive departments
of Government. Yes ! and by a resolution reÂ­
ported by a committee, upon w hom all the legisÂ­
lative power of the Government has been conferÂ­
red, that great principle in the Constitution, which
authorizes and empowers each branch of the legÂ­
islative department, the Senate and House of
Representatives, to be the judges of the election
and qualification of its own members, has been
virtually taken away from those departments of
Government, and conferred upon a committee,
who must report before they can act under the
Constitution, and allow members duly elected to
take their seats By this rule they"" assume that
there must be laws passed, that there must be
recognition in respect to a State in the Union,
with all its practical relations restored, before the
respective houses of Congress, under the ConstiÂ­
tution, shall judge of the election and qualificaÂ­
tion of its own members. What position is that?
You have been struggling for four years to put
down the rebellion. You denied in the beginning
of the struggle that any State had the right to go
out ; you said that they had neither right nor
power. The issue has been made, aud it has been
settled that a State has neither the right nor the
power to go out of tho Union ; and when you have
settled that by the executive and military power
of the Government and by the public judgment,
you turn round and assume that they are out, and
shall not come in. Laughter and cheers.
nis OWN FOLICY.
I am free to say to you, as your Executive, that
1 am not prepared to take any such position. I
said in the Senate, in tho very inception of the reÂ­
bellion, that States had no right to go out, that
they had no power to go out. That question has
been settled, and I cannot turn round now, and
give the lie direct to all I profess to have done in
the last five years. Laughter and applause. I
can do no such thing. I say that when they comÂ­
ply with the Constitution, when they have given
sufficient evidence of their loyalty and that they
can be trusted, when they yield obedience to the
law, I say extend to them the right hand of fellowÂ­
ship, and let peace and Union be restored. Loud
cheers.

HIS FAITH IN THE MASSES OF HIS COUNTRYMEN.
I know, my countrymen, that it has been insinÂ­

(the intimation has been given in high places)
that if such a usurpation of power had been exerÂ­
cised two hundred years ago, in a particular reign,
it would have cost a certain individual his head.
What usurpation has Andrew Johnson been guilty
of ? ""None !"" ""none !"" The usurpation I have
been guilty of has always been standing between
the peoileund the encroachments of power ; and
because I dared say iu a conversation with a
fellow citizen and a Senator, too, that I thought
amendments to the Constitution ought not to be
so frequent ; that their effect would be that it
would lose all its prestige and dignity ; that the
old instrument would be lost sight of in a small
time ; because I happened to say in a conversaÂ­
tion'that, if it was amended such and such amendÂ­
ments should be adopted, it was a usurpation of
power that would have cost a king his head at a
certain time. Laughter and arjplause.l And, in
connection with this subject, it wrs explained that
wo were inthe midst of earthquakes, that they tremÂ­
bled and could not yield. Yes, thero is an earthÂ­
quake coming ; there is a ground swell coming of
popular judgment and indignation. ""That's
true.'.' The American people will speak by their
instincts, and they will know who are their friends
and who their enemies.
HIS RECORD.
What positions have I occupied ? I have occuÂ­
pied all positions under this Government, beÂ­
genning with an alderman and running through
all branches of the legislature. A voice ""From
a tailor up."" Some gentleman says I have been a
tailor. Tremendous applause. Now, that did
not discomfit me in the least, for when I used to
be a tailor I had the reputation of being a good
one, and of making close fits Great laughter
always punctual with my customers and always
did good work. A voice ""No patchwork. ""J No,
I do not want any patchwork ; I want a whole suit.
But we will pass by this little facetiousness. My
mends may say, ""lou are President, and you
must not talk about buch things. "" When principles
are involved, my countrymen, when tho existence
of my country even is imperilled, 1 will act as I
have on former occasions, and speak what I think.
I was saving that I had held nearly nil positions
from akicrman, through both branches of ConÂ­
gress, to that which I now oecnpy, and who is
there ihat will say Andrew Johnson over made a
pledge that he did not redeem ? or made a promise
that he did not fulfill? Who will say he has ever
acted otherwise than in fidelity to the great mass
of the people ? They may talk about beheading
and usurpation, but when I am beheaded I want
the American people to be the witnesses. I do
not want by inuendoes, by indirect remarks in
high places, to sec the man who has assassination
brooding in his bosom exclaim, ""This Presidential
obstacle must be gotten out of the way."" I make
use of a very strong expression when I say that I
have no doubt the intention was to incite assassiÂ­
nation, and so get out of the way '""the obstacle""
from place and power. Whether by assassination
or not, there are individuals in this Government,
I doubt not, who want to destroy our institutions
and change the character of the Government. Are
they not satisfied with one murder we have had ?
Does net the murder of Lincoln appease the venÂ­
geance and wrath of the opponents of this GovernÂ­
ment ? Are they still unslaked ? Do they still w ant
more blood ? Have they not got honor and courÂ­
age enough to attain their objects otherwise than
by the hands of the assassin ? ""No ! no!""
HI MEWS ON ASSASSINATION.
I am not afraid of assassins attacking me where
a brave and courageous man would attack another.
I only dread him when he would go in disguise,
his footsteps noisless. If it is blood they want,
let them have courage enough to strike like men.
I know they are willing to wound, but they are
afraicl to .strike. Applause. If my blood is to
be shed because I vindicate the Union and the
preservation of this Government in its original
purity of character, let it be shed, but when
it is shed, let an altar to the Union be errected,
and then if it is necessary, take me and lay mo
upon it. and the blood that now warms and aniÂ­
mates my existence shall be poured out as a last
libation of tribute to the Union of these States.
Great applause.) But let the opponents of this
Government remember that when it is poured out,
"" the blood of the martyr will be the seed of the
church."" Cheers. I
CONVERSATION WITH MR. LINCOLN THE LATE PREÂ­
SIDENT'S VIEWS ON REPRESENTATION.
Gentlemen, this Union will grow ; it will conÂ­
tinue to increase in strength and power, though it
may bo cemented and cleansed with blood. I have
talked longer now than I intended to speak. Let
me thank you for the honor you have done me.
So far as this government is concerned, let me say
one other word in reference to tho amendmeuts of
the Constitution of the United States. When I
reached Washington for the purpose of being inÂ­
augurated as Yice President of the United States,
I had a conversation with Mr. Lincoln.- We were
talking about the condition of affairs, and in reÂ­
ference to matters in my own State. I stated that
wc had called a convention, and amended our
Constitution by abolishing slavery in the State
a State not embraced in his proclamation. All
this met his approbation and gave him encourageÂ­
ment, and in talking upon the amendment to the
Constitution he said : ""When the amendment to
the Constitution is adopted by three-fourths of the
States we shall have have done all or pretty nearly
all I am in favour of in amending the ConstituÂ­
tion, if there was one other adopted."" Said I,
""what is that Mr. President ?"" Said he, ""I have
labored to preserve this Union ; I have toiled
four years ; I have been subjected to calumny and
misrepresentation, yet my great desire has been
to preserve the Union of these States intact, under
the Constitution as they were before."" But, said
I, ""Mr. President, what amendment do you refer
to ?"" He said ho thought there should bo on
amendment added to the Constitution which
would compel all the States to send their Senators
and Bepresentatives to the Congress of the United
States. Yes, compel them. The idea was in his
mind that it is a part of tho doctrine of secession
to break up the government by States withdrawÂ­
ing their Senators and Representatives from ConÂ­
gress, and, therefore, he desired a constitutional
amendmend to compel them to be sent. How
now does the matter stand ? In the Constitution
of the country, even that portion of which proÂ­
vides for the amendment of the organic law, says
that no State without its consent, shall be deprived '
oi its representation.
A FLEA FOR SOUTHERN REPRESENTATION.
And now what do w e find ? We find the position
taken that States shall not be represented, that we
may impose taxes, that we may send our taxÂ­
gathers to every region and portion of a State,
that the people are to be oppressed with taxes, but
when they come here to participate in the legislaÂ­
tion of the country, they are met at tho door and
told, ""no ; you must pay taxes, you must bear the
burdens of the Government, but you must not
participate iu the legislation of the country, which
is to affect you for all time."" Is this just ? ""No,
no."" Then I say let us admit into the councils of
the nation those who are unmistakably and unÂ­
questionably loyal ; those men who acknowledge
their allegiance to the Government, and swear to
support the Constitution. It is all embraced in
that. The amplification of an oath makes no difÂ­
ference if a man is not loyal ; but you may adopt
whatever test oath you choose to prove their loyÂ­
alty that is a matter of detail for which I care
nothing let him be unquestionably loyal, owning
his allegiance to the Government, and willing to
support it in its hour of peril and of need, and I
am willing to trust them. I know that some do
not attach so much importance to this principle as
I do, but one principle we carried through the
Revolution was that there should bo no taxation
without representation. I hold to that principle
laid down as fundamental by our fathers. If it
was good then, it is good now. If it was a rule
to stand by then, it is a rule to stand by now. It
is a fundamental principle that should be adhered
to as long as free government lasts.
HE UNROLLS THE CONSTTrUTION.
! X know it was said by some during tho rebellion

that our Constitution had been rolled upas
piece of parchment, and laid away ; that in the
time of war and rebellion there was no Constitu5
tion. Well, we know that sometimes from the
very great necessity of the case, from a great emerÂ­
gency, we must do unconstitutional things in orÂ­
der to preserve the Constitution itself. jlu n
while tho rebellion was going on the Constitution
was rolled up as a parchment ; if it was violate ,
in some particulars to save the Government, there
may have been some excuse to justify it.
now that peace has come ; now the war is over
we want a written Constitution ; and I say tin:
time has come to take the Constitution down, un
roll it, re-read it, and understand its provision..
Now, if you have saved tho Government by Ut.
lating tho Constitution in war, you can only saw
it in peaco by preserving tho Constitution, and the
only way to preserve it is by a strict adherence t,
the Constitution of our fathers as it is now unfoMÂ­
ed. It must now be read and understood by the
American people. I come here to-day, as far as I
can, in makingthese remarks, to vindicate the (v,n.
stitution and to save it, for it does seem to me that
encroachment after encroachment is proposed, j
stand to-day, prepared, so far as I can, to resist
these encroachments upon the Constitutioa aid
Government. Now that wo have peace, let us vuÂ­
force the Constitution ; let us live under and bv
its provisions ; let it be published ; let it be print,
ed m blazing characters, as if it were in the heavÂ­
ens, punctuated with stars, that all may read and
understand ; let us consult that instrument ; let
us digest its provisions, understand them, and unÂ­
derstanding, abide by them.
I tell the opponents of this Government, (I canÂ­
not from what quarter they come, whether from
tho East, West, North or South,) you who are enÂ­
gaged in the work of breaking up the Government

by amendments to the Constitution, that the prinÂ­
ciples of free government are deeply rooted in the
American heart. All the powers combined, I canÂ­
not of what character thoy are, cannot destroy
that great instrument that great chart of freeÂ­
dom. They may seem to succeed for a time, but
their attempts w'iil bo futile. They might as well
undertake to lock up the winds or chain the wave.Â­
of the ocean, and confine them to limits. The;
may think now it can be done by a concurrem
resolution; but when it is submitted to the popuÂ­
lar judgment and to the popular will, they will
find that they might as well undertako to introÂ­
duce a resolution to repeal tho law of gravity a to
keep this Union from being restored.
THE PEOPLE TO DECIDE THE OUESTION.
It is just about as feasible to resist tho great lav.
of gravity which binds all to a common centre, ;
that great law of gravity which will bring hm-l
these States, and replace them in their relations.
All these conspiracies and machinations, North
and South, cannot prevent it","unknown"

Moscow, May 27.-At 7 this morning the inÂ­
auguration of the magnificent ceremonies atÂ­
tendant upon coronation of the Emperor and
Empress was announced by ringing of hun.
dreds of bells and by thelthunder of artillery.
Even at that early hour the streets were
thronged with people, visitors from abroad
and from other parts of the empire crowding
the residents, and all striving to secure elligiÂ­
ble places from which to view the procession
and such portions of the ceremony itself, and
those not particularly favored might be able
to witness. During the entire night, in fact,
there was great activity on the streets, for not
only were the people there whose anxiety conÂ­
cerning and interest in the coronation kept
them awake, but strong squads of soldiers paÂ­
trolled all parts of the city, giving the streets
a very martial appearance.
Great bodies of soldiers shortly before 6
o'clock were stationed along the route of the
procession, four miles in length, and occupied
the streets on either side, keeping the people
on the walks. All unreserved spaces in the
streets were speedily filled by eager sightÂ­
seers, while thl windows, doorways and
house-tops were let out at fabulous prices to
visitors.
. Those dignitaries of the realm who
were to take part in the actual ceremony of the
coronation assembled, according to a prearÂ­
ranged programme, at the Cathedral of the
Holy Assumption, within the walls of the
Kremlin.
These functionaries entered the magnificent
building at 7:30 a. m. At about 8 there folÂ­
lowed in order princes of foreign Governments,
nobility of Russia and other States of Europe,
and special and regular emibassadors of forÂ­
eign countries residing in Russia. The utmost
care was exercised to prevent the admission
of any unauthorized or improper persons.
Each one as he appeared at the entrance was
required to exhibit a carefully prepared ticket,
which was subjected to the closest scrutiny.
This form was observed at
THE KREMLIN
and the doors of the Cathedral. At the request
of Gen. Von Schweritz, Embassador from GerÂ­
many, eight members, comprising the DiploÂ­
matic Corps, assembled at his mansion and
were conveyed thence to the Kremlin in suÂ­
perbly equipped coaches, richly gilded as to
their harness and coats of arms. The reÂ­
mainder of the diplomatic body, consisting of
attaches of the various legations, were asÂ­
signed to positions in the Tribune, just outÂ­
side'tbe Uathe irgl proper, but inside the enÂ­
closure of tile hiremlin. When the white walls
of that wondrous place closed all of the crow~
that could be admitted a choir of boys cliant0t
a Te Deum, and amidst profound silence outÂ­
side the church as well as in it, the clergy, adÂ­
companied by acolytes, bearing a cross and
ewer of holy water, proceeded to receive thile
Czarevitch. This scion of royalty, who was in
thale-nidst~f 'v:blrlliant cortege, took her plans
at tlisaighitlÃ½f9olf the throne,
Wlhen the iimipei-ial procession started it was
made known to those inside th' Cathedral by
a renewed ringing of bells, by sonorous music
from scores of bands and by shouts from those
outside. As the royal pair appeared at the
doors of tile palace the immense multitudeimÂ­
mediately uncovered their heads and burst into
loud aeclamations. Even women were bonnetÂ­
bare~.;ind tie: eilthusiasm was unaffected as it
was spontaneous and hearty. At the headof
tile. royal procession, which now entered the
Kremlin, was the master of ceremonies,
flanked by heralds richly clad and mounted on
pure white horses. It was of immense length,
and composed of deputies from tile Asiatic
States of the empire, students of the universiÂ­
ty, clergy, judges, nobility and prefects from
every section of tile empire. Wlen its front
rank reached the doors of the palace it was met
by the Emperor, wearing the white uniform of
a Colonel of the Imperial Guards, and by the
Empress, dressed in the Russian national cosÂ­
tume of black velvet, richly embroidered with
diamonds, and girdled with a magnificent belt
of precious stones. The Empress leaned on the
arm of her royal consort. The pair placed
themselves beneath the
CANOPY RICIILY WROUGHIIT IN SILK AND GOLD,
and borne by thirty-two Generals of high miliÂ­
tary rank. They then took their places near
the head of the procession,being directly after
the regalia. At this moment the entire body
of clergy emerged from the cathedral in order
to meet the regalia, which they publicly
sprinkled with holy water and perfumed with
incense.
Upon entering the portals of the cathedral
the Emperor and Empress were received by
the Metropolitan of Moscow, Metropolitans of
Novogorod and Kieff, who presented the cross
to be kissed and sprinkled with holy water,
first by the Emperor and then the Empress.
Belore sacred images, which flanked the doors
of the cathedral, they knelt and bowed their
heads, after which tney were conducted to the
ancient thrones of ivory and silver. AlexanÂ­
der occupied the ancient throne of tile
Czar Vladlmir Monomague, while the
Empress was seated in an armÂ­
chair, gilded and incrusted with
jewels, The thrones were placed upon a dais,
erected between the two middle columns of the
catnedral. Over the dais was a canlopy of
scarlet velvet, susplendted( trom a rich root enlÂ­
broidered withll gold and lined with silver broÂ­
cade, which wts wuorked with thile arms of
RIussia and all hier dempendencies in the most
ingenious manlner. In front of the throtne
were two tables covered with gold cloth, upon
which were pitced the crowns, orb -Ind scepÂ­
ter. Nome but foreigt p~rincis were accominoÂ­
dated with seats. Russian princes and digniÂ­
taries stood during thle entire ceremony, acÂ­
cording to the customn of thile Greek. Tihe digÂ­
nitaries of the realh, wto were carrying the
standardc and seals of the empire, took their
sttanid upon thie steps of thile dais.
After tteir minjestices had been seated thie


AMetropolitan of .ovogorod asked tile Emperor
in a loiul nd distinct voice, ""Are you a true
believer?""
TIIE dIPEROR, FALLING ON HIS KNEES,
read in reply,in
it clear voice,the Lord's Prayer
and th, Apostles' Creed of the Greek Church,
the Metrospolitan responding, ""May the grace
of the Holy Ghost remain with tace."" DcÂ­
seended from tho'dais.th, following customary
summons was then three times repeateu by the
Bishop:
""It there be any of you here present knowÂ­
ing any impetdimenlt for which Alexnnder, son
of Alexander, should not be crowned by the
Grace of God Emperor end Autocrat of all the

and of Oldenbutrg, let illm come forward in the
nainm of the Holy Trinity and show what the

ever.""
After rendine selrctions from the gospel, the
Metropolitatls of Novorgorod and li if again
ascended the dais and invested thb Emperor
with the
IMPERIAL MANTLE OF ERMINE,
the Metropolitan of Moscow saying at the
salne time: !'Cover an'd protect thy-peoplo as
this robe proteqts and coveirs'thee.;""
The Emperor responded: ""I.will, I-will, I
will, God helping.""
The -ietropolitin of Vovorcorod, .crossing
his hands upoin thie head of tilhe Emperor, thenÂ­
invoked the benedlrtton of-Almighty God upon
him and his reign, end delivered to Alexander
III. the crown of Russia, who placed I. upon

press, who knelt liet""rd hli&u He touched her




 head lightly with the crown of the Emperor,
and then formally crowned her with her own
crown. The expression and attitude of the
Empress as she knelt was one ot sympathy
with her royal husband and touched
deeply the audience. The Czar preserved
throughout a grave and decorous dignity and
nobleness of demeanor, which also provoked
the admiration of ill. After the Empress had
been duly invested with the imperial mantle,
and their Majesties were seated on their
thrones, the Archdeacon intoned the imperial
titles, and sang, ""Domine Salvum Ine lmperÂ­
atorem,"" which was takep'up and thrice re.
peated by the choir. Directly this part of the
ceremony was finished, tim bells of all the
churches in Moscow rang oit in chorus, a saÂ­
lute of 101 guns was fired, and inside
the cathedral members of the imÂ­
perial family tendered their congratulations
to their Majesties. The Emperor then
knelt and recited a prayei. and at the end of
which the clerty and all knelt before the EmÂ­
peror. The Bishop of Moscow said aloun, in
behalf of the nation, a fervenit prayer for the
happiness of their Mijestles. Shouts of
""Long live the Emperor' then rent the catheÂ­
dral, tnub were taken ip bythousands outside
and carried from mouthl to mouth, until that
part of the multitude who were unable to get
inside even the ample acreage of the Kremlin
caught the sound and waved in a huge vol.
tinme of human gratulatipn to the remotest
parts of the city, when it was speedily made
known to all the world that another Czar of
the Itussias had been crowned.
ANNOINTED.
Tihe cathedral choir teen sang Te Deune,
after which the Emperor ungirded his sword,
and, accompanied by the Empress andnuÂ­
merous dignitaries, proceeded to the
gate of the sanctuary. There the
Metropolitan of Novglgrod annointed tile
Emperor's forehead, eyelids, nostrils, lips,
ears, breast and hands, at the same time exÂ­
claiming, ""Behold the seal of the
Holy Ghost, may it keep ""thee
ever holy.', The Empress was anotinted
on the forehead. Both partook of the
sacrament and then left the cathedral, wiarÂ­
ing their crowns and mantles, the Emperor
also bearing the scetreo aid orb. Afterpraying
in tlihe Cathedral of Michael the Archangel their
Majesties returned to th'e palace, escorted by
a procession, which presented even a more
splentdid sight than that which escorted them
to the cathedral, being now augmented by the
gorgeous state carriages of the imperial family.
Banners waved from all points in
the Kremlin and the whole route of the
procession fairly glowed with bright draperies
and hangings. The Emperor re-entered the
palace by the celebrated redstair-case, whence
laws were anciently promulgated. There he
turned and saluted the people, who imme.
dlittely uncovered their heads, cheering enÂ­
thusiastically and blessing the Czar.
THE IMPERIAL IBANQUET
began at 3:30 p.m., in the hall called the GranÂ­
ovitaia Palate. This hall was specially
restored for the occasion, and was
splendidly decorated with cloth of
gold. The Emperor and Empress, wear.
ing their crowns, sat .at separate
tables on thrones of unequal height. Their
Majesties were served by distintuished nobles,
acting as cup-bearers, carvers. etc. The first
toast was ""His Majesty, the Emperor,"" folÂ­
lowed by a salute of sixty-one guns. The next
was ""Her Majesty, the Empress,"" followed
by flfty-one guns. The third was; ""The ImÂ­
perial foushhold,"" followed by thirty-one
guns, and thie fourth was, ""The
clergy and faithful subjects,"" folÂ­
low. d by twenty-one guns. Foreign
princes and diplomates present stood daring
the first course and afterward, in accordance
with ancient custom, withdrew to a separate
repast. The weather was fine throughout the
day, and everything assed off successfully.
Silver tokens in memory of the day were disÂ­
tributed in twenty Moscow churches to-night.
THE CZAR'S MANIFESTO
was issued this evening and is a document of
very considerable length, Tile manifesto anÂ­
nounces a continuance of the present state of
affairs in Russia, conditional pardon of Poles,
remission of penalties for non-political of.
fenses and other matters, as previously reÂ­
ferred to in these dispatches.
Crowds besieged the printing office to obÂ­
tain copies, the perusal of which caused great
rejoicing.
The Czar has addressed the following rescript
to De Girs, Minister of Foreign Affairs:
The great power and glory acquired by RusÂ­
sia, thanks to Divine Providence, thle extent
of her empire and her numerous population,
leave no. room for any idea of further conÂ­
quests. My solicitude is exclusively devoted
toÂ­ the peaceable 4evelop~ent of the
country and ts pl'oserity, to th '6preservation
of friendly relations with foreeign powers on
the basis of existing treaties and to the mainÂ­
tenance of the dignity of the empire. Having
found in you aconstant, zealous and useful
collaborator for the promotion of these views
in the direction of our international relations,
I confer upon you my order of St. Alexander
Newski, in diamonds, as a testimony of my
gratitude.""
Before their majesties left the palace the
route to the cathedral was sprinkled with holy
water. A heavy rain fell betore their majes.
ties started, but just as they took their places
under the canopythe sun shone brilliantly. In
the cathedral it was noticed that when the
Czar knelt alone to utter a prayer of intercesÂ­
sion his
EYES FILLED WITH TEARS
and lie sobbed audibly as he read. In making
a profession of faith the Czar's voice was
grandly resonant. The Metropolitan of NovÂ­
gorod almost broke down in delivering his alÂ­
locution.
Mounted Cossacks' patrolled every street,
and troops lining thie route of the procession
remained bareheaded the whole morning.
Those unable to obtain admission to the
Kremlin remained outside on their knees,close
to the walls, during tile best part of the
day, praying for tihe Czar. A correspondent
who witnessed the greatest pageants during
the last thirty-five years says the spectacle
culmanating in the advent of their Majestics,
crowned and robed, was the most imposing
and splendidt he ever beheld.
The cost of the coronation is estimated at
Â£2,000,000, which will be covered by
the issue of treasury bills. Only
thirteen newspaper correspondents were
allowed inside the cathtcdril during the


ceremony-six h ussian, ana seven foreign, the
latter, including one English and one AmoeriÂ­
can correspondent. An academy professor
and twelve Russian artists were appointed to

REJOICINGS AT ST. PETERSBURG.
ST. PETERSBURG, May 27.-Tile coronation of
the Czar was celebrated by special services in
all the churches to-day, and by a parade of
troops. The city was brilliantly illuminated
to-night, and the streets were thronged with
people. Perfect order prevailed.
The Kremlin Square was so densely packed
that it would ha""e been impossible for any
miscreant to have extricated his arms, should
he have intended to use them against the Czar.

Emperor Paul I., and is valued at8,000,000
roubles. TIlE ROYAL STANDARD.

sented by their personal adjutant generals.
GERMIANY AND RUSSIA.

Bronchitis.
This is an irritation or inflamation of the
bronchial tubes, which carry the air we breathe
into the lungs. It arises from a cold settled in
the throat, from Catarrh extending to these
parts, from screfulous affections and from severe
use of the voice. The irritation from this latter
cause commences in the larynx and glottis,
which are the organs of the voice, and extendÂ­
ing downwards, produces hoarseness, coughing
and spitting mucous matter, sometimes mixed
with blood. It is chiefly dangerous from its
tendency to spread into the lungs, and terminÂ­
ate in consumption. It is in the cure of severe
nd obstinate cases of this disease that Dr.
Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery has acnievÂ­
ed unparalleld success, and won the loudest
praise from all who have used it. It is sold by
all respectable druggists.
The Harvest of the Head.
When the comb acts as a rake, bringing away
a roll of parted fibers every time it passes
through tho hair, baldness would soon be ineÂ­
vitable. But even in this case, forlorn as it may
seem, the mischief can be arrested, the loss reÂ­
paired. Lyon's Cathairon, aiaed by a brisk apÂ­
plication cf the brush to promote the absortion
of the fluid hy the scalp, will stop the thinningÂ­
out process in forty-eight hours. The roots
from which the dead filaments were shed will
soon be re-endowed with vitality, and a new
growth will speedily spring up on the denuded
places. This work of reproduction will go on
until the damage is completely repaired, and
the luxuriant crop of hair thus produced will
never wither or fall out as long as the vitalizing
application is regularly continued.

DR. TALM AGE'S SERMON FOR LATE
JULY IN SCOTLAND.

""Jeans the Kama High Over All"" The
Wonderful Word Alleviation of HuÂ­
man Borrow Dying Teatlmoaiee of
Many Eminent Men.
LOXDOS, July SL Since his return from
Russia Dr. Talmage bag been literally
flooded with invitations to address congreÂ­
(rations and lyceums on the subject of his
journey to the land of the czar, whither be
went with Mr. Lonis Klnpsch te direct the
distribution of The Christian Herald reÂ­
lief cargo. While expressing his high apÂ­
preciation of the cordiitl welcome and
Hpiendid hospitality extended by the ofÂ­
ficials of St. Petersburg and Moscow, of
the civic honors heaped upon the AmeriÂ­
can visitors and of Russia's national gratiÂ­
tude to America, as personally expressed
by the cznrowiu at Peterhof, where he
entertained them as guests. Dr. Talmage
has been compelled to adhere to his origiÂ­
nal programme. During the week he has
been preaching in the leading Scottish
cities. His arrangements for next week
include services at Newcastle and SunderÂ­
land, and thereafter he goes to the Isle of
Man for a few days. The sermon selected
for this week is entitled ""Pre-eminent,""
the text being John ill, 81, ""He that
cometh from above is aliore all.""
""The most conspicuous character of hisÂ­
tory Btepa out upon the platform. The linÂ­
ger which, diamonded with light, pointed
down to him from the Bethlehem sky, was
only a ratification of the finger of prophecy,
the finger of genealogy, the linger of chroÂ­
nology, the linger of events all five finÂ­
gers pointing in one direction. Christ is
the overtopping figure of all time. He is
the vox humana in all music, the gracefulÂ­
est line in all sculpture, the most exquisite
mingling of lights and shades in all paintÂ­
ing, the acme of all climaxes, the dome of
all cathedraled grandeur and the peroraÂ­
tion of all splendid language.
The Greek alphabet is made up of
twenty-four letters, and when Christ comÂ­
pared himself to the first letter and the
last letter, the alpha and the omega, he
appropriated to himself all the splendors
that you can spell out either with those
two letters and all letters between them.
""I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beÂ­
ginning and the end, the first and the
last."" Or, if you prefer the words of the
text, ""above all.""
It means, after you have piled up all AlÂ­
pine and Himalayan altitudes, the glory of
Christ would have to spread its wings and
descend a thousand leagues to touch those
summits. Pelion, a high mountain of
Thessaly; Ossa, a high mountain, and
Olympus, a high mountain; but jnythology
tells us when the giants warred against
the gods they piled up these three mounÂ­
tains and from the top of them proposed
to scale the heavens; but the height was
not great enough and there was a complete
failure. And after all the giants Isaiah
and Paul, prophetic nnd apostolic giants;
Raphael and Michael Angelo, artistic
giants; cherubim nnd seraphim and archÂ­
angel, celestial giants have failed to climb
to the top of Christ's glory, they might all
well unite in the words of t he text and say,
""He that cometh from above is above all.""
THK CEXTIiAL THEME IN PREACHING.
First, Christ must be above all else In
our'preaching. There are so many books
on homiletics scattered through the world
that all laymen, as well as ail clergymen,
have made tip their minds what sermons
ought to be. That sermon is most effectual
wtHcb most pointedly puts forth Christ as
the pardon of all sin and the correction of
all evil, individual, social, political, naÂ­
tional. There is no reason why wo should
ring the endless changes on a few phrases.
There are those who think that if an exÂ­
hortation or a discourse have frequent
mention of justification, sanctiflcation,
covenant of works and covenant of grace,
that, therefore it must bo profoundly
evangelical, while they are suspicious of
a discourse which present s the same truth,
but under different phraseology.
Now, I say there is nothing in all the
opulent realm of Anglo-Saxonism or all
the word treasures that we inherited from
the Ijatin and the Greek and the IndoÂ­
European but we have a right to marshal
it in religious discussion. Christ sets the
example. His illustrations were from the
gross, tho flowers,' tho spittle, the salve,
the barnyard fowl, the crystals of salt, as
well as from the seas and the stars, and we
do not propose in our Sabbath school teachÂ­
ing and in our pulpit address to be put on
the limits.
I know that there is a great deal said in
our day against words, as though they
were nothing. They may be misused, but
they have an imperial power. They are
the bridge between soul and soul, between
Almighty God and the human race. What
did God write upon the tables of stones?
Words. What did Christ utter on Mount
Olivetf Words. Out of what did Christ
strike tho spark for the illumination of the
universe? Out of words. ""Let there be
light,"" and light was. Of course thought
is the cargo and words are only the ship,
but how fast would your cargo get on withÂ­
out the ship?
What you need, my friends, in all your
work, in your Sabbath school class, In
your reformatory institutions, and what
we all need is to enlarge otir vocabulary
when we come to speak about God and
Christ and heaven. We ride a few old
words to death when there is such illimitÂ­
able resource, Shakespeare employed fifÂ­
teen thousand different words for dramatic
purposes; Milton employed eight thousand
different words for poetic purposes; Rufus
Choate employed over eleven thousand dif
ferent words for legal purposes, but the
mast of us have less than a thousand
words that wo can manage, less than five
hundred, and that makes us so stupid.
ALL SWEET WORDS SEEDED.
When we come to set forth the lbve of
Christ we are going to take thetenderest
phraseology wherever we find it, and if it
has never been used in that direction beÂ­
fore, all the more shall we use it. When
we come to speak of the glory of Christ.
the conqueror, we are going to draw our
similes from triumphal arch and oratorio
and everything grand and stupendous.
The French navy have eighteen flags by
which they give signal, but those eighteen
nags they can put into sixty-six thousand
different combinations. And I have to tell
you that these standards of the cross may
be lilted Into combinations infinite and
varieties everlasting. And let me say to
young men who are after awhile going to
preach Jesus Christ, you will have the.
largest liberty and unlimited resource.
You only have to present Christ in your
own way.
Jonathan Edwards preached Christ in
the severest argument ever penned, and
John Bunyan preached Christ in the sub-
Iimest allegory ever composed. Edward
Payson, sick and exhausted, leaned up
against the side of the pulpit and wept out
bis discourse, while George Whitefleld,
with the manner and the voice and the
start of an actor, overwhilmed his audi
tory. It would have been a different thing
If Jonathan Edwards had tried to write
and dream about the pilgrim's progress to
the celestial city or John Bunyan had atÂ­
tempted an essay on the hunJhn will.
Brighter than the light, fresher than the
fountains, deeper than the seas are all
these Gospel themes. Song has no melody,
flowers have no sweetness, sunset sky has
no color compared with these glorious
themes. These harvests of grace spring
up quicker than we can sickle them. KinÂ­
dling nuloits with their fire, and oroduciwc

iwroronons wirnTnerr power, ngnting up
dying beds with their glory, they are th
sweetest thought for the poet, and they
arc the most thrilling Illustration for the
orator, and they offer the most intense
scene for the artist, and they are to the
embassador of the sky all enthusiasm.
Complete pardon for direst guilt. SweetÂ­
eat comfort for ghastliest agony. BrightÂ­
est hope for grimmest death. Grandest
resurrection for darkest sepukber.
Oh, what a Gospel to preach! Christ
over all in it. His birth, his suffering
bis miracles, his parables, his sweat, his
tears, his blood, his atonement, bis interÂ­
cession what glorious themes! Do we
exercise fnithr Christ hi its object. Do
wehavelo-? It fastens on Jesus. Have
we a fondness for the church? It is beÂ­
cause Christ died for it. Have we a hope
of heaven? It is because Jesus went
ahead, the herald and the forerunner.
The royal robe of Demetrius was so
costly, so beautiful, that after he had put,
it off no one ever dared put it on; but this
robe of Christ, richer than that, the poorÂ­
est, and the wanest, and the worst may
wear. ""Where sin abounded grace may
much more abound.""
THE JOT OF THE CONVERTED.
""Oh, my sins, my sins,"" said Martin
Luther to Staupitz; ""my sins, my sins!""
The fact is that the brawny German stuÂ­
dent had found a Latin Bible that had
made him quake, and nothing else ever

k did make him quake; and when he found
how, through Christ, he was pardoned
and saved, he wrote to a friend, saying:
""Come over and join us great and awful
linners saved by the grace of God. You
teem to be only a slender sinner, and you
don't much extol the mercy of God; but
ire who have been such very awful sinÂ­
ners praise bis grace the more now that
we have been redeemed.""
Can it be that you are so desperately
egotistical that you feel yourself in first
rate spiritual trim, and that from the toot
of the hair to tjie tip of the toe you tire
scarless and immaculate ? What you need
is a looking glass, and here it is in the
Bible. Poor and wretched and miserable
and blind and naked from the crown of
the head to the sole of the foot, full of
wounds and putrefying sores. No hea'th
in us. And then take the fact that Christ
gathered up all the notes against us and
paid them, and then offered us the receipt
And how much we need him in our sorÂ­
rows! We are independent of circumÂ­
stances if we have his grace. Why, he
made Paul sing in the dungeon, and under
that grace St. John from desolate Patmos
heard the blast of the apocalyptic trumÂ­
pets. After all other candles have been
snuffed out, this is the light that gets
brighter and brighter unto the perfect day.
and after, under the hard hoofs of calamÂ­
ity, all the pools of worldly enjoyment
have been trampled into deep mire, at
the foot of the eternal rock the ChrisÂ­
tian, from cups of granite, lily rimmed
and vine covered, puts out the thirst of his
soul.
Again, I remark that Christ is above all
in dying alleviations. I have not any sym
pathy with the morbidity abroad about
our demise. The emperor of Constantino
pie arranged that on the day of his corona
tion the stonemason should come and conÂ­
sult him about his tombstone that after
awhile he would need. And there are
men who are monomanical on the subject
of departure from this life by death, and
the more they think of it the less they are
prepared to go. This is an unmanliness
not worthy of you, not worthy of me.
THE HERO'S DEATH.
Saladin, tho greatest conqueror of his
Jay, while dying, ordered the tunic he had
on him to be carried after his death on a
spear at the head of his army, and then the
soldier ever and anon should stop and say:
""Behold, all that is left of Saladin, the emÂ­
peror and conqueror! Of all t he states he
conquered, of all the wealth he accumuÂ­
lated, nothing did he retain but this
shroud!"" I have no sympathy with such
behavior, or such absurd demonstration,
or with much that we hear uttered in reÂ­
gard to departure from this life to the
next. There is a commonsensical idea on
this subject that you and I need to considÂ­
erthat there are only two styles of deÂ­
parture.A thousand feet underground, by light
of torch toiling in a miner's shaft, a !edge
of rock may fall upon us and we may die a
miner's death.. Far out at sea, fulling
from the slippery ratlines and broken on
the halyards we may die a sailor's death.
On mission of mercy in hospital, amid
broken bones and reeking leprosies and
raging fevers we may die a philanthroÂ­
pist's death. On the field of battle, servÂ­
ing God and our country, the gun carriage
may roll over us and we may die a patriot's
death. But after all there are only two
styles of departure the death of the rightÂ­
eous and the death of the wicked, and we
all want to die the former.
God grant that when that hour comes
you may be at home! You want the hand
of your kindred in your hand. You want
your children to surround you. You want
the light on your pillow from eyes that
have long reflected your love. You want
the room still. You do not want any curiÂ­
ous strangers standing around watching
you. You want your kindred from afar to
hear your last prayer. I think that is the
wish of all of us. But is that all? Can
earthly friends hold us when the billows of
death come up to the girdle? Can human
voice charm open heaven's gate? Can huÂ­
man hands pilot us through the narrows of
death into heaven's harbor? Can an earthly
friendship shield us from the arrows of
death and in the hour when satan shall
practice upon us his infernal archery?
No, no, no, no! Alas! poor soul, if that is
all. Better die in the wilderness, far from
tree shadow and from fountain, alone,
vultures circling throusrh the air waiting
for our body, unknown to men, and to have
no burial, if only Christ could say through
tho solitudes, ""I will never leave thee, I
will never forsake thee."" .. From that pilÂ­
low of stone a ladder would soar heavenÂ­
ward, angels coining and going; and
across the solitude and the barrenness
would come the sweet notes of heavenly
minstrelsy.
DEATH OF TOE CHRISTIAN.
Gordon Hall, far from home, dying in
the door of a heathen temple, said, ""Glory
to thee, O God!"" What did dying WilÂ­
berforte say to his wife? ""Come and sit
beside me, and let us talk of heaven. I
never knew what happiness was until I
found Christ."" What did dying Hannah
More say? ""Togo to heaven; think what
that is! To go to Christ, who died that I
might live! Oh, glorious gravel Oh, what
a glorious thing it is to die! Oh, the
love of Christ, the love of Christ!"" What
did Mr. Toplady, the great hymn maker,
say in his lost hour? ""Who can measure
the depth of the third heaven? Oh, the
sunshine that fills my soul! I shall soon
be gone, for surely no one can live in this
world after such glories as God has maniÂ­
fested to my soul.""
What did the dying Fanewaysay? ""I
can as easily die as close my eyes or turn
my head in sleep. Before a few hours have
passed I shall stand on Mount Zion with
the one hundred and forty and four thouÂ­
sand, and with the just men made perfect,
and wo shall ascribe riches and honor and
glory and majesty and dominion unto God
and the Lamb."" Dr. Taylor, condemned
to burn at the stake, on his way thither
broke away from the guardsmen and went
bounding and leaping and jumping toward
the fire, glad to go to Jesus and to die for
him. Sir Charles Hare in his last moment
had such rapturous vision that he cried,
""Upward, upward, upward!""
And so great was the peace of one of
Christ's disciples that he put his fingers
upon the pulse In his wrist and counted it,
and observed it; and so great was bis
placidity that -&itsr awhile he sairl
Children Cry for Pitcher's

""stoppM,"" ana nis ma naa enoea netv to
begin in heaven. Bat grander than that
was the testimony of the worn out Aral
missionary when in the Mamartin dunÂ­
geon be cried: ""I am now ready to be ofÂ­
fered, and the time of my departure is at
band; I have fought the good fight, I have
finished my course, I have kept the faith;
henceforth there l laid up for me a crown
of righteousness, which the Lord, the
rightraus judge, will give me In that day,
and not to me only, but to all them that
love his appcarim;!"" Do you not see that
Christ is bIkjvo all in dying alleviations?
Toward the last hour of our earthly resiÂ­
dence we are speeding. When I sea the
sunset I say, ""One day lesa to live."" When
I see the spring blossoms scattered I say,
""Another season gone forever."" When I
close this Bible on Sabbath night I any,
""Another Sabbath departed."" When I
bury a friend I say, ""Auother earthly atÂ­
traction gone forever."" What nimble feet
the years have! The roebucks and the
lightnings run not so fast. From decade
to decade, from sky to sky, they go at a
bound.
There Js a place for us, whether marked
or not, where you and I will sleep the last
sleep, and the men are now living who
will, with solemn tread, carry us to our
resting place. Aye, it is known In heaven
whether our departure will be a coronaÂ­
tion or a banishment. Brighter than a
banqueting hall through which the light
feet of the dancers go up and down to the
sound of trumpeters will be the sepulcher
through whose rifts the holy light of
heaven streameth. God will watch you.
He will send bis angels to guard your
slumbering ground until, at Christ's beÂ­
hest, they shall roll away the stone.
So also Christ is above all in heaven.
The Bible distinctly says that Christ b
the chief theme of the celestial ascription,
all the thrones facing his throne, all the
palms waved before his face, all the crowns
down at his feet. Cherubim to cherubim,
seraphim to seraphim, redeemed spirit to
redeemed spirit shall recite the Saviour's
earthly sacrifice.
THE GLORIOUS C05IPANT OF THE REDEEMED.
Stand on some high hill of heaven, and
in all the radiant sweep the most glorious
object will bo Jesus. Myriads gazing on
the sears of bis suffering, In silence first,
afterward breaking forth Into acclamation.
The martyrs, all the purer for the flame
through which they passed, will say, ""This
is Jesus, for whom we died."" The apostles,
all the happier for the shipwreck and th
scourging through which they went, will
say, ""This is the Jesus whom we preached
at Corinth, and at Cappadocia, and at AnÂ­
tioch, and at Jerusalem."" Little children
clad in white will say, ""This is the Jesus
who took us in his arms and blessed us, and
when the storms of the world were too
cold and loud brought us into this beautiful
place."" The multitudes of the bereft will
say, ""This is the Jesus who comforted us
when our heart broke."" Many who had
wandered clear off from God and plunged
Into vagabondism, but were saved by
grace, will say: ""This is tho Jesus who
pardoned us. We were lost on the mounÂ­
tains, and he brought us home. We were
guilty, nnd ho made us white as snow.''
Mercy boundless, grace unparalleled. And
then, after each one has recited his peculiar
deliverances and peculiar mercies, recited
them as by solo, all the voices will come
together in a great chorus, which shall
make the arches echo and re-echo with the
eternal reverberation of gladness and peace
and triumph.
Edward I was so anxious to go to the
Holy Land that when he was about to exÂ­
pire he bequeathed 1160,000 to have his
heart after his decease taken to the Holy
Land in Asia Minor, and his request was
complied with. But there are hundreds
today whose hearts are already in the holy
land of heaven. Where your treasures
are there areyour hearts also. John BunÂ­
yan, of whom I spoke at the opening of the
discourse, caught a glimpse of that place,
and in his quaint way he said: ""And I
heard in my dream, and lo! the bells of the
city rang again for joy; and as they opened
the gates to let in the men I looked in after
them, and lo! the city shone like the sun,
and there were streets of gold, nnd men
walked on them, harps in their hands, to
sing praises with all; and after that they
shut up the gates, which when I had seen
I wished myself among them!""

Horses and Riders.
Some day an interesting article may be
written on horses that have made history.
Last month two horses came very near
changing the course of events in two emÂ­
pires. On May 27, as Lord Salisbury was
driving down St. James street, one of the
carriage horses got its leg over the traces
and thereby upset the nervous equilibrium
of its companion. The two then bolted
down the street and could not be stopped
until they upset the carriage and made a
general spill. Lord Salisbury was lifted
out of the overturned vehicle, shaken but
uninjured. His hat, however, was smashed.
Had it been his head, what a difference it
would have made!
In Germany the young emperor's horses
have run away with him once more, but
this time, beyond rushing over a hedge and
across a field they only afforded the emÂ­
peror an opportunity for the display of his
""customary coolness"" the episode had no
result. Had the runaway team broken the
emperor's neck what a prospect there
would have been before Germany and EuÂ­
rope! The heir to tho German throne is a
child of ten, who but the other day received
his first commission in the German army.
There would have been a regency with all
its complications. Review of Reviews.

Oration of Colonel Robert G. Ingersoll

at his Brother's Funeral.

The funeral of Hon. Elieu C. Intersoll.
brother of Colonel Robert G. Ingcrsoll, of
Illinois, took place at his residence, at
Washington, Monday afternoon, 2d iuat.
Tiie ceremonies were extremely simple, conÂ­
sinting merely of viewing the remains by
relatives nml friends nnd n funeral oration
by Colonel Robert G. Ingeisoll, brother of
the deceased. A large number of distinÂ­
guished gentlemen were present, including
Secretary Sherman, Awustant Secretary
Hawley, Senators Ulainc, Voorhees, PadÂ­
dock, Allison, Logan, Hon. Thomas HenÂ­
derson, Governor Pound, Hon. William M.
Morrison, General JefTiie.s, General WilÂ­
liamson, Colonel James Finhhack, and oi ItÂ­
ers. Tlie pull bearers were .Senators Blaine,
Voorhees, David Davis, Paddock mid AlliÂ­
son, Colonel Ward 11. Lamon, Hon. JereÂ­
miah Wilson, of Indiana, and Hon. ThomÂ­
as A. Boyd, of Illinois. The following is
the oration of Colonel Ingeisoll, which was
received by nil present with marks of deep
and sincere feeling and sympathy.
""My Friends: I am going to do that
which the dead o.Y promised he would
do for me. The loved and loving biolhÂ­
cr, husband, father, friend, died where
manhood's morning aliiuml touches ihe
noon, i. nd while shadows slill were falling
lownrii me nesi. jib nail not passed on
life's highway the stone that innrks I bo
highest point, but being weary f. r moÂ­
ment he laid down by the ways'ide, iiuiI.iihÂ­
ing his burden for a pillow, lell into lhal
dreamless sleep that kisses down his eyeÂ­
lids still. While yet in love with life and
raptured with the world he passed to siÂ­
lence mid pathetic dust. Yet, alter all, it
may be best just in Ihe happiest, sunniest
hour of all the Voyage, while eager winds'
are kissing every sail to dash against the
unseen lock, and iu mi instant hear the bilÂ­
lows roar above a sunken ship. For whethÂ­
er in mid sea or 'lining the breakers of the
farther shore, a wreck muse mark nl least
Ihe cud of each and all, and every lite, no
matter if i la every hour is rich wiih love
and every moment jewelled wild a joy,
wi. I si its close, become a tragedy, lis sud
and deep and dark as can be woven uf the
warp nml woof of mystery nnd death.
This brave and lender nun in every
storm of lifii was oak and rock, but in the
sunshine he was vine and flower, lie was
a friend of all heroic souls. He climbed
the heights and left all superstition far beÂ­
low, while on bis forehead fell the golden
dawn of a grander day. He loved the
beautiful, and was with color, form mid
music touched to tears. He-ided with the
weak, and with n willing hand gave alms
with a loyal heart, and with the purest
baud he faithfully discharged all public
trusts. He was u worshiper of liberty, a
fi iend of the oppressed. A thousand tunes
have I heard hiui quote the words, For
justice, all place a temple, nnd a 1 season
summer. He believed that happiness was
the only good, reason the only torch, jusÂ­
tice Ihe only woiahipper, humanity the
only religion, and love tlie only priest. He
added 10 the sum of human joy, mid were
every one for whom he did some loving
set vice lo bring a blossom to his grave he
would sleep lo night beneath n wilderness
of flowers. Life- isanariow vale between
Ihe cold mid narrow peaks uf two eternities.
Wu strive in vain to look beyond the heights.
We cry aloud and the only ansner is the
echo of our wailing cry. From the voiceÂ­
less lips of Ihe uiucpling dead there comes
no word; but in the night of death hope
sees a slur, and listening love can hear the
rustle of a wing. He whosleepsherewhen
dying, mistaking the approach of death for
the return uf health, whispered with his
latest breath, I am belter now. Let us beÂ­
lieve in spile of doubts mid dogmas, mid
tears and fears, that these dear words lire
true of nil Ihe countless dead. And now
to you who have besu chosen from among
the many men he loved to do the list sad
ollicc fur Ihe dead we give his sacied dust.
Speech cannot contain our love. There
was, there is no gentler, t longer, manlier
man.""
There was no ceremonies whatever at the
grave, but a pathetic scene ocelli red when
ihe Misses Lawler, daughters of the bite
General Lanier, and adopted children of
Eben C. Ingeisoll, to whom they were deÂ­
votedly attached, look their last leave of
their dead foster-la I her. One of them
fainted in being taken lo her carriage, and
the other lingered at Ihe grave until almost
forcibly led away by her friends.

                 [The following poem, written by a young Scotehman named William Knox, was a par- ticular favorite with Abraham Lincoln. F. B. Carpenter, the artist, writes that while engaged in painting a picture, at the White Rouse, he was alone one evening with the President in his room, when he said: "" Thore is a poem which has been a great favorite with me for years, which was first shown me when a young man by a friend, and which I afterwards saw and cit from a newspaper and learned it by heart. I would,"" he continued, ""give a great deal to know who wrote it, but have never been able to ascertain.""]
                 0, why should the spirit of mortal be proud ?
                 Like a swift fleeting meteor, a fast flying cloud, A flash of the lightning, a break of the wave, Alan passes from life to his rest in the grave.
                 The leaves of the oak and the willow shall , Be scattered around and together be laid,
                 And the young and the old, and the low and the high, Shall  to dust and together shall die. The infant, a mother attended and loved;
                 The mother, that infant s :affection who proved;
                 The husband, that , and infant  blessed Each, all, are away to their dwelling of rest.
                 The maid on whose check, on whose brow, in whose
                 eye,
                 Shone beauty and pleasure-her  are by;
                 Aed the memory of those who loved her and praised, Are alike  the  of the living erased.
                 The hand of the king that the sceptre hath borne The brow of the priest that the mitre hath worn- The eye of the sage and the heart of the brave, Are hidden and lost in the depth of the grave, The peasant whose lot was to sow and to reap,

                 Have quietly mingled their bones in the dust.
                 So the multitude goes, like the flower and weed, That '   to let others succeed
                 So the multitude comes, even those we behold, To repeat every tale that blath often been told.
                 For we are the same that our fathers have been
                 We see the same sights that our fathers have seen,
                 We drink the same stream, and we feel the same sun, And run the same course that our fathers have run. The thoughts we are thinking, our fathers would

                 shrink;

seen in the history of the McCormick

For 65 years they have simply been
building grain and grass-cutting maÂ­
chinery, $nd while there are probably
forty manufacturers in this line, it is
safe to say that the McCormick

"274","81026","HINT TO DRAMt DRINKERS. Bar-keepÂ­
ers pay, on an average, 82 per gallon for
whisky. One gallon contains an average
of fifty-five drinks, and at ten cents a drink
the poor man pays $6.50 per gallon for his
whiskey. In other words, he pays $2 for
the whisky and $4.50 to a man for handing
it over the bar. While it would be better
for all not to drink, some men will have
whisky, and my advice to them is this:
Make your wife your bar-keeper. Lend
her $2 to buy a gallon of whisky for a beÂ­
ginning, and every time you want a drink
go to her and pay ten cents for it. By the
time you have drank a gallon she will have
$6.50, or enough money to refund the $2
borrowed of you, to pay for another galÂ­
Ion of liquor, and have a balance of $2.50.
or enough money to refund the $2 borrowÂ­
ed of you, to pay for another gallon of liÂ­
quor, and have a balance of $2.50. She
will be able to conduct future operations
on her own capital, and'when you become
an inebriate, unable, to support yourself,
shunned and despised by respectable peoÂ­
ple, your wife will have enough money.to
keep you until you get ready to fill a
drunkard's grave. But had you paid all
this money to a bar-keeper, he would not
have given a cent to bury you, or a crust
of bread to keep your children from starvÂ­
ing.
Few people ever stop'to calculate the
cost of dram-drinking. At ten cents per
drink,'one drink per day will cost $26.50
per year; two drinks.per day will cost $73;
three drinks, $109.50; and four drinks,
$146 per year.

er; In the course of the last summer considerable
anxiety was caused for a short time by an official
intimation from the Government of Great Britain
as that orders had been given for the protection of the
â€¢ fisheries upon the coasts ofthe British Provinces in
.North America against the alleged eneroachments
no of the fishing vessels of the United States and
h France. The shortness of this notice and the seaÂ­
Sson of the year seemed to make it a matter of urÂ­
i gent importance It was at first apprehended that
' an increased naval-force had been ordered to the
fishing grounds to carry into effect the British InÂ­
terpretation of those provtisons in the convention of
itÂ­ 1818, in reference to the true intent of which the
t
two governments differ. It was soon discovered
* that such was not the design ol Groat Britain, and
- satisfactoryexplanations of the real objects of the
measure have been given both here and in London.
The unadjusted difference, however, between
s, the two governments as to the interpretation of the

matter of importance. American fibAhmg vessels
w ithin nine or ten yeare have been exc uded from
- waters to which they had Iree access for twelntyÂ­
.t five years after the negotiation of the treaty. In
1815 this exclusion was relaxed so fur as concerns
the Bay of Fundy, but the just'and liberal IntenÂ­
tion of the Home government, in compliaonce with
i what we think the true construetion of the convenÂ­
., tion, to open all the other outer bays to our fisherÂ­
: mea,'was ahandoned, in oasequtaence of the oppoÂ­
* sition of the colonies. Notwithstanding this, the
a.
United States have, since the Bay of Fundy was
reopened to our fishermen in 1-1l, pursued the most
Sliberal course towards the eolonial fishing interests.
I. By the revenue law of 1816, Ithe duties on colonial
' fish entering our ports were very greatly reduced,
and by the warehousmgact it is allowed to be eaÂ­
e tered in bond without payment of duty. In this
way colonial filsh ha acqured, the monopoly of the
r
export trade in our market, and is entering to some
extent into the home consumption. Those facts
were among those which increased the sensibility
of our fishing interest,at the movement in question.
iThese
circumstaoces and the incidents above atÂ­
laded to have led me to tlink tile momunt favornble
for a reconsideration of the entire subject of the,
, fisherieson the coasts of the British provinces
with a view to place them upon a more liberal footÂ­
ing of reciprocal privilege. A williugaess to meet
ous it some arrangement of this kind is understood
Sto exist, on the part of Great Britain, with a desire
, on her part to include in one comprehensive settleÂ­
s meat, as well this subject as the commercial interÂ­
t course between the United Sta:en and the British
provinces. I have thought that whatever arrange.
5 ments may be made on these two subjects, it isex.
, pedicot that they should be embraced tn separate
a. conventions. he illness and death of the late SoÂ­
cretary of Slate prevented the commencement of
the eontempuated negotiation. Pains have been
taken to collect the imformation required for the
details of such an arrangement. The subject is atÂ­
tended with considerable difficulty. If it is found
it practicable to come to an agreement mutually acÂ­
cepthable to the two parties, coaveations may be

concluded to the coorse of the present winter. The

The affairs of Cuba formed a prominent topic in
my last annual message. They remain in an unÂ­
easy condittlot, and a feeling of alarm and irritaÂ­
t. lion oil the part of thei Cuban authorities appears
to exist. . his feeling has interfered with the reÂ­
gular commercial iuterconrse between the United
States and the island, and led to some acts of which
we have a right to complain. But the Captain GeÂ­
- onral of Cuba is clothed with no power to treat
t with foreigno governments, nor is he in any degree
Sunder the control of the Spunish Minister at WashÂ­
ington. Any communicatlon which he may hold
m with an agent of a foreign power is informal and
matter of courtesy. Anxious to put an end to the
s existing inconveniences, (which seemed to rest on
i misconception,) I directed the newly appointed
Minatter to Mexico to visit Havana, on his way to
n Vern Crnz. 10o was respocifu ly received by the
Captaiu General, who conferred with him Ireely on
the recent occurrences; but no permanent arrangeÂ­
ment was ffected.
. In the.mean time, the refusal of the Cuptain GoÂ­
Snral t1 allow pansoagrs andÂ­ the mail to b landed
in certain cases, for a reason which does not furÂ­
nish, in the opinion of this government, even a
good presumptive ground for such a prohibition,
has been made the subject of a serious remonÂ­
strance at Madrid; and I have no reason to doubt
that due respect will be paid by the government of
Her Catholic Majesty In the representations which
our Minister has been instructed to make on the
subject.
It is but justice to the Captain General to add,
that his conduc toward thie steamers employed to
car y the mails of the United States to Havana has,
ge
with the exceptions above alluded to, been marked
he
with kindness and liberality, and indicates nogeneÂ­
on ral purpose of interfering with the commercial corÂ­
s respondence and intercourse between the island and
this country.
S Early in he present year olicial notes were reÂ­
i0 ceived from the Mitisters of Franco and England,
w inviting the Government of the United States to
)st
become a party with Great Britain and France to
ed
a tripartite Convention, in virtue of which the
r three powers should severally and collectively disÂ­
claim, how and for the future, all intention to obÂ­
t tain possession of the Island ofCub, and should bind
themselves to discountenance all attempts to that
ial effect on the part of any power or individual what
isÂ­
ever. This invitation has been respectfully deÂ­
co clined, for reasons whichit would occupy tooemuch
ilÂ­ space in this communication to state in detail, but
which led me to think that the proposed measure
d would be of doubtlul constitutionality, impolitic,
m and unavailing. Ihave, however, incommon with
ge
severatl e my predecessors, directed the Ministers
he
of France amd England to be assured that the UniÂ­
cs ted States entertain no designs against Cuba; but
that, on the contrary, I should regard its incorporaÂ­
tlon into the Union at the present time as fraught
a with serious peril.
h Were this island comparatively destitule elfinhaÂ­
le. bitants, or occupied by a kindred race, I should reÂ­
reÂ­
gard it, if voluatarilyceded by Spain, as a most deÂ­
nut sirable acquisition. But, under existing circumÂ­
to stances, I should look upon its incorporation into
our Union as a very hazardous measure. It would
nw bring into the Confederacy a population ofa differÂ­
I
a eat national stock, speaking a different language,
ter
and not likely to harmonize with the other memÂ­
IeÂ­ bers. It would probably affet in a prejudicial
of manner the industrial interests of the South; and it
might revive those conflicts ofopinion between the
aÂ­ diterent sections of the country, which lately shook

aÂ­ happily compromised,

eÂ­ exist, or may hereafter arise, between the govern

b Ouru settlements on the ibores of the Pacific
have already given a. great extension, and in
ice same respects a new direction, to our commerce
inÂ­ i that ocean, A direct Ptd rapidly-increasing
intercoirse has sprung up with Eastern Asia. The
ful
waters of the Northern ecific, even into the
ce Aretic sea, have of late years-been frequented by
ur our wholemen. The application of steam to the
dÂ­ general purposes of navigatiou is becomiag daily
1e_
more common, and makreeÂ­ it desirable to obtain
fnuel and other necessary supplies at convenient
n poetls on the roto between Asia and our Pacific
shores. Our unfortunate countrymen who from
to
time to time nulier shipwreek on the coasts of the
ve
eastern seas are entitled to protection. Besides
ibÂ­
thes specific objects the general prosperity of our
n.
States on the Pacific requires that an attempt
a should be made to open theopposite regions of
Asia to a mutually beneficial mtercourse. It is
ie obvious that this attemapt could be made by no
ed
power to ao great advantage as by the United
im Steles, whose constitutional oyrstem excludes every
idea of distant colonial dependencies. I have aeÂ­
tle cordingly been led to order on appropriate naval
inl force to Japan, under the command of a discreet
do and intelligent olticer of. the highest rank known
ha to our service. He is instructed to endeavor
in to obtain from the government of that country
its
some relaxation of the inhospitable and antiÂ­
nd social system which it has pursued for about
taÂ­ wo centuries. He hasbeen directed particularly
i
to remonstrate in the stfongest language against
ut the cruel treatment to which our ship-wrecked
he manners have often been subjocted, and to insist
n. that they shall be treated with' humanity. He is
of instructed, however, at the same time to give that
be government the amplest asasrances that the objects
rd of the United Stoten are suach, rd such only as I
Ad have indicated, and that theexpedition is friendly
Sand b eaceful. Notwithstanding the jealousy with
which the governments of Eastern Asia regard all
! overtures from foreigners, I tm not without hopes
te
alabeneficial result of tho'cypedition. Should it
abe crowned with success, the advantages will not
e be confined to'thu United lates, but, as in the
m case of China, will be equalltepjoyed by all the
other maritime powers. I have much satisfaction
toin atmoo g that on all the steps preparatory to this
is
expedition the Government of the United States
- has been materially aided by the good oaices of the
th King of the Netherlands, the only European power
. having acycommorelal relations with Japan.
rÂ­ In passlor from this survey of our foreign relaÂ­
. ions, I invite the attention of Congress to the eonÂ­
he
dition of that department of the Government to
as
which this branch of the public business is entrustÂ­
st ed. Our intercourse with foreign powers has of
late years greatly icreased, both in consequence
0j of our own growth and the introduction of many
d, new States into the lamilyoflnations. In this way
. the Department of State has become overburdened.
It has, by tile recent establishment of the DepartÂ­
Lmeat of the Interior, been relieved oa some portion
n of the domesti bunsionesa. I the residue of the buÂ­
siness of that kind, such as thoedistribution of ConÂ­
-y
gresionai doeumenta, the keeping, publishing and
Sdistribution
of the laws of the United Statle, the
execution of the copyright law, the subject of reÂ­
e priuves and pardons, and some other subjects relaÂ­
, tioto interior administration, should be transferÂ­
red trom the Department of State, it wonld unquesÂ­
tioubly hbe for the benefit of the publie service. I
et
would also suggest that the building appropriated to
d tile State Dpartment is not fire proof; that there is
reason to think there are defectin its construction,
and that the arohives of the Government in charge
rÂ­ of the Department, with the precious collections of
the manuscript papers of Washington, Jefferson,
a.
Imilton, Madison, and Monroe, are exposed to
a.
destruction by fire. A similar remark may be

s, In my first annual message to Congress I called
ed
your attention to what seented to me some defects
usÂ­ in
the present tarilff and recommended such modiÂ­
rÂ­ ficatlions as, in my judgment, were best adapted to
ad
remedy its evils and promote the prosperity of the
country. Nothing has sinuce occurred to change
eÂ­ my views on this important question.
Id,
Without repeating the arguments contained in
to tny former message, in favor of discriminating,
to protective duties, I deem it my duty to call your
he attention to one or two other considerations aflectÂ­
isÂ­ ing this subject. The first is, the aefect ol large'
bÂ­ importatios o0 Ibreign goods upon our currency.
,d
Most of the gold of California, as fasnt as it is
iat
coined, finds its way directly to Europe in payÂ­
at
ment tor goods purchased. In the second place,
IeÂ­
as our manufactaring establishments are broken
ch down by competition with foreigners, the capital
ut invealted in them is lost, thousands ol honest and
ire
industrious citizens are thrown out of employment,
ic, and the larmer to that extent is deprived of a home
ith market for the sale of his surplus produce. In
era the third place, the destruction of our manufac.
niÂ­ tures leaves the foreigner without competition in
bnt our market, and he eonrueqently raises the price
enÂ­ of the article sent here for salea, as is now seen in
ght
the increased cost of iron imported from England.
The prosperity and wealth of every nation must
taÂ­
depend upon its productive industry. The farmer
reÂ­ is stimulated to exertion by finding a ready marÂ­
ieÂ­
ket for his surplus products, and benefitted by
mÂ­ being able to exchange them, without loss of time
to or expense of transportation, for the manufactures
aid
which his eomfort or convenience requires. This
erÂ­
is always done to the best advantage where a porÂ­
ge, tion of the community in which heliveosis engaged
aÂ­ in other pornuits. But moat manufactures require
int a amount of Capiml and a pmrctical citll which
lit cannot be commanded, unless they be proteotedfor
he a time from ruinous competition from abroad.
tok Hence the necessity of laying those duties upon
so imported goods which the Constitution authorizes
for revenue, m such a manner oa to protect and enÂ­
lbe courage the labor of our own citlzons. Duties,
:en
however, should not be fixed at a rate so high as to
inÂ­ exclude the foreign article, but ehould be so graduÂ­
feÂ­ ated as to enanhlo the domestic moufaneturer fairly
of to compete with the foreigner in our own markets,
of and by this competition to reduce the price ol the
of manufclured article to the consumer to the lowest
wn rate at which It can be produced. This policy
tot would place the mechanic by the side of tholfarmer,
ng reole oa mutral intenrchnge ofther rspetofive omÂ­
modities, and thus stimulate the industry of the
inÂ­ whole onutary, andrender us independeat or'foreign


t, nations fo tr e supplies required by the abits or
the
necessities of the people.
her Another question, wholly independent of protecÂ­
lion, presents itseef, and that is, whether the duties
ho levied should be upon the value of the article at the
enÂ­
place of shipment, or, who e it is practicable, a
and
pecific duty, graduated according to quantity, as
onÂ­ ascertained by weight or measure. All our duties
the n at present ad evalore. A certain per centage
the islevied on the price of the goods at the port of shipÂ­
tedmeat in a foreign country. Most commercial naÂ­
50. tions have found it indispensable, for the purpose of
oe,
preventing fraud end perjury, to make the duties
ter, specific whenever the article is of such a uniform
in value in weight or measure as to justify such a
e duty. Legislationshould nevereanourage dishonestÂ­
Sto
ty
or crime. It s impossible that the revenue ofÂ­
ubÂ­ licers atthe port where the goods are entered and the
a
to
duties paid, should know with certainty what they
the costin the foreign country. Yetthe lawrequires that
lih they should levy the duty according to such cost.
der They are therefore compelled to resort to very anÂ­
o satisfactory evidence to ascertain what that cost
e wasThby take the invoice of the importer, atÂ­
alÂ­ estedy his oath, as the beat evidence of which
,ped
the nature of the case admits. But every one
nice mstl see that the invoice may be fabricaled, and
:oen
the oath by which it is supported false, by reason
to of which the dishonest importerpays a part only of
alto the dutles which are paid by the honesrt one, and
thus indirectly receives from the treasury of the
exÂ­ United States a reward for hts fraud and perjury.
owÂ­ The reports of the SecretaryofthoTreasnry here
ales lurore made on this subject show. conblusively that
our these fraud have been praceetied to a great extent.
the The tendency is to destroy that high moral characÂ­
t
of ta for which our merehants have long been dlstinÂ­
payÂ­ guished; to defraud the Government ois reveauei;
to break down thehonest importer by a dishonest
the competition; and, finally, to transfer the business o
t of
munportaltion to foreign and irresponsible agents, to
thethe great detriment of our own citizens. I there.
aterÂ­
fore again moat earnestly recommend the adoption
)anÂ­
of epefisduties, wherever it is practicable, or a
a
to
home valuation, to prevent these frauds.
aries
I would also again call your attention to the fact
to
of
that the present toriff in some ceses imposes a
iht,
higher duty
pon the raw material imported than
In upon the article manufactured frotn t, the con.e
r at quence of which is that the duty operates to the ean

had It it be the desire of Congress to remove them

to parlticuolar districts more remote from the settleÂ­

to provide the means necessary for removing them

ties Indians requires the prompt action of Congress on

fic The amendments proposed by the Senate to the
in treaties which were negotiated with the Sioux InÂ­

The removal of the remnant of the tribe of SemÂ­

eots to the commissioner and surveyor to make no farÂ­
,diÂ­
ther requisitions on the Deportment, as they eould
to not be paid; and to discontinue all operation on the
the southern line of New blexieo. Bat as theDlopartÂ­

it was tell discretionary with them to continue the

at their disposal would enable them, or at once to
disband the Commission. A special messenger has

SEvery effort has been made to protect our fronÂ­
tier, and that of the adjoining Mexican States, from
Sof the Incursions of the Indian tribes. O1 about 11,000
ties men of which the army is composed, nearly 8,000
are employed in the defence of the newly-acquired
ch a territory, including exas,) and of emigrants proÂ­
te needing thereto. am gratified to say that these
,e. efforts have been unusually successful. With the
tthe exception of some partial outbreaks in Calfornia
theyand
Oegon
and occasional depredations on a paorÂ­
that lion of the Rio Grando, owing, it is believed, to
cst.
the ditalurbedstato of that border region, the inÂ­
nÂ­ roads at the Indiansa have been effectually reÂ­
cst strained.
at. Experience has shown, however, that whenever
tic the two races are brought into contact, collisions
one will inevitably occur. To prevent these collisions
and thu United States have generally set apart portions
an of their territaryfor the excluttsivuoccupatiu of the
ly of Indian tribes. A dificulty occurs, however, in the
and application of thispolicy to Texas. By the terms
the o the compact by which that State was admitted
into the Union, she retained the ownership of all
cr the vacant lands within her limits. The govern.
,that meat of that State, it is understood, has assigned
tent no portion of her territory to the Indimas; but as
uac. fast as her ettlemcnts advance lays it off intocounÂ­
stivÂ­ ties, and proceeds to survey and sell it. ThispoiÂ­
aeer
cy manifestly tends, not only to alarm and irritate
tuest the Indians, but to compel them to resort to plunÂ­
as of der for subslitence, It also deprives this GovernÂ­
,o meat of that influence and control over them with.
. out which no durablepeat can ever exist be.
plion tween them and the whites. I trust, therrefore, thal
or a a du regard for her own interests, apaert from conu
soderatioas of humanity and jutltie, will induce
fact that State to assign a small portion vl her vast do
main for the provisional occupancy of the small
than remnants of tribes within her borders, subject of
course to her ownership and eventual jurisdiction.
.
enÂ­ If she should fail to do this, the lfulfilment of oun
treaty stipulations with Mextco, and our duty te
roleÂ­ the Indians themselves, will, it to feared, become a
o the subject of serious embarrassment to the Govern
meat. It is hoped, however, that a timely and juso
to provision by Texas may aevrt this evil.

The report from the Navy Department will inÂ­
reÂ­ form yon ofth prosperous condition of the branch
oe the public service committed to its charge. It
iÂ­ presents to your consideration many topics and sugÂ­
heÂ­
gestiolnsl of which I alr your approval. It exhibtls
to anunusual degree of activity mi the operations of
ed.the
Department duricg the pant year. The prepaÂ­
t rations for the Japan expedllion, to which I have
ItlÂ­ already alluded; the arrangements made for the exÂ­
try
plorationand survey of the ChinaSeas, the NorthÂ­
ter era Pacific, and Behring's Straits; the incipient
c-. measures taken towards a reconnoissance of the
e.Â­ continent of Africa eastward of Liberia; the prepaÂ­
ibe
ration for an earlyexamination of the tributaries of
adÂ­
the River La Plata, which a recent decree of the
o.Â­ rovisional chief of the Argentine Confederation
hat
as opened to navigation; all these enterprises, and
te the means by which they are proposed to be acÂ­
miÂ­ complished, have commanded my null approbation,
en and I have no doubt will be productive of most
useful results.
wa Two otficera of the navy were heretofore inÂ­
oy structed to explore the whole extent of the AmaÂ­
mÂ­
con river from the confines of Peru to its mouth.
be The return of one of them has placed mn the potÂ­
:en
session of the governament an interesting and valuÂ­
nr. able account oft the character and resources of a
country abounding in the materials of commerce,
and which, ifopened to the industry of the world,
ea.
will prove an inexhaustible lund of wealth. The
report of this exploration will be communicated to
you as soon as it is completed.
Among other subjects offered to your notice by
the Secretary of the Navy,-( select for special comÂ­
mendation, to view l its conaexion with the ianÂ­
crests of the navy, the plan submitted by him for
the establiof hmet of a permanent corps of seamen,
and the suggestions he has presented tor the reorÂ­
ganization of the Naval Academy.
In reference to the first of tbhese, t take occasion
old
to say that I think it will greatly improve the efiÂ­
ca ciency of the service, and that I regard it as stil
more entitled to favor for the salutary influence
nd it must exert upon the naval discipline, now greatÂ­
nd ly disturbed by the increasing spirit of insubordiÂ­
of nation, resulting from our present system. The
lea plan proposed for the organization of the seamen
tt
furnishes a judicious substitute for the law of SepÂ­
is. temter, 18s50, abolishing corporal puniehment,
and satisfactorily sustains the policy of that act,
rre under conditions well adopted to maintain the
es. authority of command and the order and securiÂ­
ty of our ships. It is believed that any change
which proposes permanently to disperse with
this mnode oa punishment, should be preceded by a
system ofeastetment which shall supply the navy
with seamen ot the most meritorious class, whose
good deportment and pride of character may preÂ­
ea. lude all occasion tor a resort to penalties of a harsh
tus or degrading nature. The sanety of a ship and her
on crew is olten dependant upon immediate obedience
e to a command, and the authorily to enforce it mast
be be equally ready. The arrest of a refractory sea.
ti.
man, in such moments, not only deprives the chlp
.deof
indispensable aid, but imposes a necessity tor
ith
double service on others whose fidelity to their duÂ­
ad ties may be relied uponin such anemergency. The
oe exposure to this increased and arduous labor, since
the passage of the act of 1850, has already had, to a
aÂ­ moat observable and injurious extent, the effect of
he preventing the enlistment of the beat seamea in the
ihÂ­ navy. Tan plan now nuggested ta designed to proÂ­
aÂ­ mote a condition of service in which this objection
an,
willt no longer exist. The details of this plan may
as be established in great part, it not atoagether, by the
asÂ­ Executive, under the authority ot existing laws;
liÂ­ but Ihave thought it proper, in acoordanco wth
be the suggeslion of the Secretary of the Navy, to subÂ­
ed mit it to your approval.
it The establishment of a corps of apprentices for
to the navy, or boys td be enlisted until they become
of age, and to be employed under such regulations
de as the Navy Department may devise, as proposed
to, in the report, I cordially approve and commend to
an your consideration; and I also concur in the aug.
ia, gestion that this system for the early training of
es, seamen may be most usefully engrafted upon the
ry service ofour merchant manne.
The other proposition of the report to which I
laÂ­
have referred-the reorganization of the Naval
he Academy-I recommend to your attention as a
do project worthy of your encouragement and-supÂ­
on port. The varuabla services already rendered by
this tntittion entitle it to the continuance of your
he fostering care.
int Your attention is respectfully called to the report
w of the Postmaster General for the detailed operation
e of his Department during the last fi-sal year, liom
-ds which it will be seen that the receipts from postÂ­
its ages for that time were less by 1 ,41,69 tban foree
the preceding decal year, being a decrease of about
at 23 per cnt.
rÂ­ 'hisdtminution is attributable to the reduction in
the rates of postage made by the act of March 3,
on 1831, which reduction took effect at thecommenceÂ­
enÂ­
meet of the lest fiscal year.
ed Although in its operation during the last year the
co act referred to has not filled the predictions of its
syÂ­ friends by increasing the correspondence of the
wu
country in proportion to the reduction of postage, I
ar
should naerertheless qustion the pohcy of returning
tohigherrates. Experience warrants the expectaÂ­
reÂ­
tion that as the community becomes accuetomed to
ch cheap postage, correspondence will increase. It is
d believed that from ths cause, and from the rapid
saÂ­ growth of the country in population and business,
ion the receipts of the Department must ultimately exÂ­
ter need its expenses, and that the country may solely
InÂ­ rely upon tte continuance of the present cheap rate

ostage.
eÂ­ former messages I have, amoug other things,
im respectfully recommended to the consideration of
asÂ­ Congress the propriety and necessity of further
aid legislation for the protection and puaniahment of
the foreign consuls residing in the United States; to
trtÂ­
revive with certain modifications the act of 10th
of March, 1838, to restrain unlawful military exÂ­

acted upon by Congress. Without repeating the
ity reasons for legitlation on these subjects which have
oble
been assigned in former messages,1 respectfully
ich recomtmend them again to your favorable considerÂ­
a

ions It has been the uniform policy of this GovernÂ­
lons ment from its foundation, to the present day, to abÂ­
o stain from all interference in the domestic affairs

the while the nations of Europe have been engaged in
Iii desolating wars, our country haspursued its peaceful
d course to unexampled prosperity and happiness.
The wars in which we have been compelled to en.

rnÂ­ whirlpool, we sot quiet and unmoved upon our own
it shores. While the laower offtheir umerouaarmies
wase wanted by disease or perished by hundreds of
tat housands upon the battle field, the youth of this
c nefavored land were permitted to enjoy the blessings
of petce beneath the paternal roof. While the

for this nation to become a ""propagaaÂ­

France had no sooner established a republican form

lost

iosÂ­
Here was the false step which led to her subseÂ­
IuÂ­ quent malfortoner. She soon found herself revolvÂ­
a ed in war with all the rest of Europe. In less than
ce, ten years her government was changed from a reÂ­
rid,
public to an empire; nod finally, after shedding riÂ­
che
vers of blood, foreign powers restored her exiled
to dynasty, and exhausted Europe sought peace and
repose in the unquestioned ascendancyot monareh:Â­
by cal principles. Let us leara wisdom from her exÂ­

inÂ­ always establilh freedom. Our own free omniÂ­

en, They existed (before. They were planted in the
orÂ­ free chartersoof selfgovernment under which the
English colonies grew up, and our Revolution only
ton freed us from the dominion of a foreign power,
efiÂ­
whose government was at variance with those inÂ­
still
stitutioas. Baut European nations have had no
Ice
such training for selfgovernment, and every etflrt
atÂ­ to estabhsh.it by bloody revolutions has been, and
rdiÂ­
must, without that preparation, continue to be a
'he failure. Liberty, unregulated by law, degenerates
0en into anarchy, which boon becomes the most horrid
pÂ­ of all despotisms. Our policy is wisely to govern
rot,
ourselves, and thereby to set such an example of
,at, national justice, prosperity, and true glory, as shall
the teach to all nations the blersing, ofselfgovernment,

and the unparalleled enterprise and success of a

S We live in an age of progre-s, and ours is emÂ­
ya phatically a country ol progress. Within the
vy last haltl century the number of Sates in this

Irt
our country is excited to the h.ghest pitch, and

OF THE

To the two Houses of Congress at the ComÂ­
mencement of the Second Session.
Fellow.Citi ""ns of he Senate and THouse of Representaliva :





After a brief interval the Congress of the United States L'
resumes its annual legislative labors. An all-wise and c l
merciful Providence has abated the pestilence which is
visited our shores, leaving its calamitous traces upon
some portions of our country. Peace, order, tranquillity, 1
and civil authority have been fomnally declared to exist
w
throughout the whole ofthe United States. In all the States to
civil authority has superseded the coercion of anrms, and
and the people, by their voluntary action, are maintainÂ­ P:
ing their governments in foll activity and complete opeÂ­ c
ration. The enforcement of the laws is no longer "" hÂ­ h:
structed in any State by combinations too powerful to
be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedÂ­ fr.
ings;"" and the animosities engendered by the war are g+
rapidly yieldingto the beneficent influences of our freew
institutions, and to the kindly effects of unrestricted t
social and commaercial intercourse. An entire restoraÂ­
tion of fraternal feeling must be the earnest wish of every
patriotic heart; and we will accomplish our grandest naÂ­ I
tional achievement when, forgetting the sad eventsof the c
past, and remember!og only their instructive lessons, we
resume our onward career as a free, prosperous, and el
united people.
Reconstruction. cr
In my Message of the 4th of December, 1'65. ConÂ­ pn
gress was informed of the measures which had bieen inÂ­ i
stituted by the Executive with a view to the grad.al l
restoration of the States in which the insurrection 0;
occurred to their relations with the General Government. il
Provisional Governors had been appointed, Conventions C,
called, Governors elected, Legislatures assembled, and ril
Senators and Representatives chosen to the Congress of St
the United State!. Courts had been opened for the eonÂ­ ci
forcement of laws long in abeyance. The blockade had ' inÂ­
been removed, custom-houses rei;tsblishd,. andt the inÂ­ in
ternal revenue laws put in force, in order that the people th
might contribute to the national income. I'ostal operaÂ­ re
tions had been renewed, and efforts were being made to Pt
restore them to their former condition of efliciencr. The ae
States themselves had been asked to take part in the tr
high function of amending the Constitution. and of thus at
sanctioning the extinction of African slavery as one of is
the legitimate results of our internecine stnruggle. P
Having progressed thus far, the Executive lepartment i
found thatit had accomplished nearly all that was within oa,
the scope of its constitutional authority. One thing, la
however, yet remained to be done before the work of; t
restoration could be completed, and that was the admisÂ­ ti
sion to Congress of loyal Senators and Representatives a.
from the States whose people hadl rebelled against the rg
lawful authority of the General Government. Thi.l
question devolved upon the respective Hlouise, which,
by the Constitution, are madle the judges of the elections, i
returns, and qualifications of their own members: and of
its consideration at once engaged the attention of ConÂ­ i or
gres. d
Executive Efforts.
In the meantime. the Executirbt Department--no other i,
plan having been proposed by Congress-continued its w
efforts to perfect, as far as was proeticaile. the r:-.to-i u
ration of the proper relations between' the citizens of the li,h
respective States, the State., and the l':Ieiral Gov:rnÂ­
ment, extending. from time to tinme. as ti h bie intr,::n i
seemed to require. the judicial, rev-::.re, an. psl sysÂ­
tems of the country. With the advice and c'sent c f
the Senate. the necessary officers were api''i:ed. and apÂ­
i ,
priations made by Cmgreos for the paimi,.ut of their sal lÂ­
ries. The proposition to amend the Fed,'r:l Constitution.
so as to prevent the existence of slaverÂ­ within the United p
States or any place subject to their jurisdiction, wa. ra:iÂ­ ti
fled by the requisite number of States; a:nd on the I th I
day of December. Itr15. it was officially declared to have ,
become valid as a part of the Coustitution of the I':.ited ti
States. All of the States in which the intsurroect!, hul a
existed aromptiy amended their constitutionsl .o ;, to
make them conform to the great chanes thus ,ih ,:,.ted in
the organic law of the land; declared nu'ill al vid all
i ordinances and laws of secession; repu;diated all preÂ­ i
tended debts and obligations created for the revole;inr. ""
.
puroposes of the insurrection : and proceded. in good faith '
"" to the enactment of measures for the prut.ie-ti-on 'i a:nte'Â­ a;e
lioration of the condition of the colored race. ('ongre';.
'however. yet hesitated to adimit iuiy of th,';, Stat,: t, (
h
representation; and ft was not until tow~a-s
ihe c!eos of
t:
the eighth month of the eo.-:ion that an exceiption was I
made in favor of Tennessee, by the admissiin of her SenÂ­
otors and Representatives.
Importance of Admission of Senthern Represen. a
tarives. t
I deem it a subject of profound regret that Conress has.
thus far lailed to admit to seats loyal Senatorc and I.""Â­ if
presentatives from the other States. whose inhab.tent.
with those of Tennessee, had enga:ged in the rebellion. e ,
Ten States--more than one-fourth of the whole number i tI
remain without representaticn; the seats of fify
members in the Houn.e of RPerrese;ati rves and of twenty
members in the Senate are yet va.cant-'Â­ . t by their own i
consent not by a failure of election. but by the refusal t,
of Congress to accept their credenti: Their admisÂ­ g
rson, it is believed, would have accr-:nop!i ed mucih toÂ­ i
wards the renewal and strengthening of our relations is
one people, and removed serious cause for discontent on .i
the part of the inhabitants of those S ates. It would
have accorded with the great principle enunciated in the f
Declaration of American Independlence. that no people i
ought to ltear the burden of taxation, antd yet be denied
the right of representation. It would have ieen in conÂ­ c
sonance with the erpress provisions if the Constitution,
-hat ""each State shall have at least one RepresentsÂ­
tive,"" and ""that no State. without its consent, shall be
deprived of its equal sufifrage in the Senate. These
provisions were intended to secure to every State, andl to t
the people of every State, the right of representation in
each House of Congress; and so important was it""
deemed by the framers of the Constitution that the
equality of the Etates in the Senate should be preserved, a
that not even by an amendment of the Constitution can t
any State, without its consent, be denied a voice in that I
branch of the Sational Legislature. t
eonahern ta Bt 8ulI in the Union. -i


It is true, it has been assumed that the existence of r
the States was terminated by the rebellions acts of their
inhabitants, and that the insurrection having been supÂ­
pressed, they were thenceforward to be considered I
merely as conquered territories. The Leiri.lative, ExecÂ­ 1
utive, and Judicial Departments of the Government i
have, however, with great distinctness and uniform conÂ­ I
sistency, refused to sanction an assumption so incomÂ­
1
patible with the nature of our republican system, and
a
with the professed objects of the war. Throughout the
Â° recent legislation of Congress the undeniable fact makes
itself apparent, that these ten political communities
- are nothing less than States of this _Union. At the
very commencement of the rebellion each IIoue deÂ­
Sclared, with a unanimity as remarkable as it was .i'i0Â­
aant, that the war was not ""waged, on our part, in
any spirit of oppression, nor for any purpose of conquest
or subjugation, nor purpose of overthrowing or interferÂ­
ing with the rights or established institutions of those
States, but to defend and maintain the supremacy of the
- Constitution and all laws made in pursuance thereof, and
to preserve the Union with all the dignity, equality, andl
:a rigjh of the several States unimpaired; and that as soon

c.iotinue their legislative functions, while in other inÂ­
stances Representatives were â€¢elected and admitted to
seats after their States had formally declared their right

to withdraw from the Union, and were endeavoring to
maintain that right by force. All of the States whose
people were in insurrection as States were included in
the apportionment of the direct tax of twenty millions of
dollars annually laid upon the United States by the act
approved 5th August, 1861. Congress, by the aset of
March 4, 1862,; and by the apportionment of representaÂ­
tion thereunder, also recognized their presence as States
i n the Union; and they have, for judicial purposes, been
: divided into districts, as States alone can be divided.
The same recognition appears in the recent legislation in




 reference to Tennessee, which evidently rests upon the of
fact that the functions of the State were not destroyed I 1
by tha rebellion, but merely suspended; and that princiÂ­ p
ple is of course applicable to those States which, like di
Tennessee, attempted to renounce their places in the ii
Union. 9.
The action of the Executive Department of the Govern-I >

in the l'roclaImntion issued by my predecessor on the 2 2di tt

In the admission of Senators and Representatives tl
from any and all of the States, there can be no just tl

could not happen when the Constitution and the laws are te
enforced by a vigilant and faithful Congress. Each at

Senator or Representative presents his certificate of an
election, ue may at once be admitted or rejected; or, ci
should there he any question as to his eligibility, his so
credentiale may be referred for investigation to the apÂ­ v

upon evidence satisfactory to the House of which he
thus becomes a member, that he possesses the requisite
co.nstitutional and legal qualifications. If refused ad-a
imission as a member for want of due allegiance to the oa
Government, and returned to his constituents, they are
o
admonished that none but persons loyal to the United

d internal as well as impost, are commended to the careful
t consideration of Congress. In my last Annual Meseage I
n expressed my general views upon these subjects. I need
, now only call attention to the necessity of carrying into
I every department of the Government a system of righid
Saccountability, thorough retrenchment, and wise econoÂ­
o my.. With no exceptional nor unusual expenditures, the
it oppressive burdens of taxation can be lessened by such a
modification of our revenue laws as will be consistent

)1 The report presents a much more satisfactory condition
t t of our finances than one year ago the most sanguine
Di could have anticipated. During the fiscal year ending
aÂ­ the 30th June, 1865, the last year of the war, the public
debt was increased $941,90,537, and on the 31st of OcÂ­
.. tober, 1865, it amounted to $2,740,P54,750. On the 31st
I. day of October, 1866, it had been reduced to $2,551,310,Â­
in 066, the diminution, during a period of fourteen months,

 conslmuencig September 1, 1865, and ending October 31, go
1866, having been $206,379,565. In the last annual reÂ­ no
port on the state of the finances, it was estimated that on
during the three quarters of the fiscal year ending the sic
30th of June last, the debt would -be increased $112,194,Â­ ve
947. Durilg that period, however, it was reduced sio
l3-1,196,387, the receipts of the year having been art
63J,905,905) more, and the expenditures $200,529,235 less go
than the estimates. Nothing could more clearly indicate tho
than thele statements the extent and availability of the em
national resources, and the rapidity and safety with tht
which, under our form of government, great military and lin
naval establishments can be disbanded, and expenses reÂ­ pri
duced from a war to a peace footing. fro
l)uring the fiscal year ending the 30th of June, 1866, pel
the receipts were $558,032,620, and the expenditures ter
85,20,750.940, leaving an available surplus of $37,281,680. fro
It is estimated that the receipts for the fiscal year endÂ­ Ne
ing the ""30th of June, 1867, will be $475,061,386, and that wil
the expenditures will reach the sum of $316,428,078, gis
leaving in the Treasury a surplus of $158,033,308. For
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1868, it is estimated that 1
the receipts will amount to $436,000,000, and that the poi
expenditures will be $350,97,61--showing an excess of int
; 85,752,359 in favor of the 'dovernment. These estima-. V
ted receipts may be diminished by a reduction of excise a f
and import duties; but after all necessary reductions sht
shall have been made, the revenue of the present and of tin
fillowing years will doubtless be sffilcient to cover all poc
legitimate charges upon the Treasury, and leave a large tin
annual surplus to be applied to the payment of the prinÂ­ con
cipal of the debt. There seemse now to be no good reaÂ­ qua
sion why taxes may not be reduced as the country adÂ­ pat

Report of secretary of War.
The report of the Secretary of War furtlishes valuable tic

lThe military strength of the nation has been unimpaired hab
by the discharge of volanteers, the disposition of unÂ­ Sh
serviceable or perihliable stores, and the retrenchment del
of expenditure. Sufficient war material to meet any col
emergency un as been itained, and, from the disbanded by
volunteers standing ready to respond to the national call,
large annsies can be rapidly organized, equipped, and conÂ­
centratedl. Fortifications on the coast and frontier have ers
received, or are being prepared for more powerful armsÂ­ ni

Report of the Postmaster General.
Ti'i; rieprt of the I'ostnter General presents a most
sati-tr etr"" condtition of the postal service, antd slbmits i
recmmienldatiins which deserve the consideration of ConÂ­ d
rs-s. The revenues of the Department for the year
ending Jnrine
. lIs.fi, were $14,380.9.0, and the expendiÂ­ t
turer -
f,:52.079l, sh'wiing an excess of the latter of
59i.full. In anticsipartitt of this deficiency, however, a i t
s~l,-iid appropriatiotr wais made by Congress in the act g
iapproved
. Jnlt 2u. I1.,. Includiing the stainding approÂ­
pritltiol of i$70i.i
0 for free mail matter, as a legitimate
pr:in if the revenues yet remaining unexpended, the tl
a:tual defliciency for the past year is only $'265,0t53Â­ 'Â­
.un witfhin $51.141 of the amount estimated in the an
Snual report of 1x64. The decrease of revenue compared e


with the previous year was one and one-fifth per cent..
and the increase of expenditures, owing principally to the
enlargement of the mail service in the South, was twelve b
per cent. On the 30th of June last there were in operaÂ­ I
tion six thousand nine hundred and thirty mail routes, o
Swith an aggregate length of one hundred and eighty 14
thousand nine hundred and twenty-one miles, an aggreÂ­ j1
I gate annual transportation of seventy-one million eight b
t hundred and thirty-seven thousand nine hundred and
furteen miles, and an aggregate annual cost. including
all expenditures, of x',410.184. The length of railroad t
routes is thirty-two thousand and ninety-two miles, and I
the annual transportation thirty million six hundred and
nine tho.usand fur hundred and sixty-seven miles. The
t length of steamboat routes is fourteen thousand three
hundred and forty-six miles, and the annual transportaÂ­
tion ; three million four hundred and eleven thousand nine
hundred and sixty-two miles. The mail serviceis rapidly 1
increasing throughout the whole country, and its steady
d extension in the Southern States indicates their conÂ­
e stantly impronng condition. The growing importance of
the foreign service also merits attention. The Post i
Office Department of Great Britain and our own have
agreed upon a preliminary tasis for a new postal conÂ­ 1
vention, whhic it is believed will prove eminently beneÂ­
licial to the commercial interests of the United States,
Si innamuch as it contemplates a reduction of the internsÂ­
e tional letter postage to one half the existing rates ; a reÂ­
i duction of postage with all other countries to and from
Q whicth correspondence is transmitted in the British mail,
al
or in closed mails through the United Kingdom ; the esÂ­
I tablishment of uniform and reasonable charges for the
d sea and territorial transit of correspondence in closed
to mails; and an allowance to each post office department
id
of the right to use all mail communications established
o. under the authority of the other for the despatch of corÂ­
le
respondence, either in open or closed mails, on the same
a terms as those applicable to the inhabitants of the coonÂ­

ry Report of Seeretar of Interior.
The report of the Secretary of the Interior exhibits
in the condition of those branches of the public service
Ie which are committed to his supervision. During the
ig last fiscal year four million six hundred and twenty-nine
lie
thousand three hundred and twelve acres of public land
Were disposed of, one million eight hundred and ninetyÂ­
two thousand five hundred and sixteen acres of which
were entered under the homestead act. TheÂ­ policy
is, originally adopted relative to'the publie lands has underÂ­

 gone essential modifications. Immediate revenue, and dri
not their rapid settlement, was the cardinal feature of for
our land system. Long experience and earnest discusÂ­ tar
sion have resulted in the conviction that the early deÂ­ lea
velopment ofour agricultural resources, and the diffu. Me
sion of an energetic population over our vast territory, Imi
are objects of far greater importance to the national Fri
growth and prosperity than the proceeds of the sale of noi
the land to the highest bidder in open market. The preÂ­ Go
emption laws confer upon the pioneer who complies with ha
the terms they impose the privilege of purchasing a the
limited portionlof ""unoffered lands"" at the minimum the
price. The homestead enactments relieve the settler 1
from the payment of purchase-money, and secure him a cot
permanent home, upon the condition of residence for a ter
term of years. This liberal policy invites emigration Mi
from the Old, and from the more crowded portions of the for
New World. Its propitious results are undoubted, and a5Â­
will be more signally manifested when time shall have of
given to it a wider development. the
The Publio Lands. ci
Congress has made liberal grants of public land to corÂ­ of
porations, in aid of the construction of railroads and other for
internal improvements. Should this policy hereafter preÂ­ to
vail, more stringent provisions will be required to secure run
a faithful application of the fund. The title to the lands Re
should not pass, by patent or otherwise, but remain in lib
the Government and subject to its control until some Pal
portion of theroad has been actually built. iortions of res
them might then, from time to time, be conveyed to the of
corporation, but never in a greater ratio to the whole
quantity embraced by the grants than the completed wh
parts bear to the entire length of the projected improveÂ­ WA
ment. The restriction would not operate to the prejudice sol
of any undertaking conceived in good faith and executed of
with reasonable energy, as it is the settled practice to to
withdraw from market the lands falling within the operaÂ­ pus
tion of such grants, and thus exclude the inception en
of a subsequentldverse right. A breach of the condi CI
lions which Congress may deem proper to impose should an
work a forfeiture of claim to the lands so withdrawn but wel
unconveyed, and of title to the lands conveyed which thj
remain unsold.
Paclfie BnRllroad. the
Operations on the several lines of the Pacific railroad evi
have been prosecuted with unexampled vigor and success. tie
Should no unforeseen causes of delay ocour, it is confiÂ­ ji`

by Congress. ar
Pensioners. Fr
During the last fiscal year the amount paid to pensionÂ­
pry
ers, including the expenses of disbursement, was thirteen he
million four hundred and fifty-nine thousand nine hundred I
and ninety-six dollars; and fifty thousand one hundred
rei
and seventy-seven names were added to the pension rolls.
The entire number of pensioners June 30, 18f6, was one for
hundred and twenty-six thousand seven hundred and aui
twenty-two. This fact furnishes melancholy and strikÂ­ i
ing proof of the sacrifices made to vindicate the oonstituÂ­ a l
tional authority of the Federal Government, and to main. tic
tain inviolate the integrity of the Union. They impose
j
upon us corresponding obligations. It is estimated that il
thirty-three million dollars will be required to meet the tri
exigencies of this branch of the service during the next it
fiscal year. .i
Indians.
Treaties have been concluded with the Indians, who,
enticed into armed opposition to our Government at the
Ih
outbreak of the rebellion, have unconditionally submitted ie
to our authority, and manifested an earnest desire for a
renewal of friendly relations.
During the year ending September 30, 1566, eight thouÂ­
sand seven hundred and sixteen patents for useful invenÂ­ ha
tion and design were issued, and at that date the balance
. I,,:
in the Treasury to the credit of the patent fund was two i of
hundred and twenty-eight thousand two hundred and i ot
ninety-seven dollars. tis
Levees. ob
As a subject upon which depends an immense amount ha
of the production and commerce of the oountry, I recomÂ­ ' il
mend to Congress such legislation as may be necessary oc
for the preservation of levees of the Mississippi river. It lie
is a matter of national importance that early steps should I to
be taken not only to add to the efficiency of these harÂ­ i to
riers against destructive inundations, but for the removal
i ar
of all obstructions to the free and safe navigation of that I i
great channel of trade and commerce. ni
District of Columbia. I fe
The District of Columbia, under existing laws. is not tr
entitled to that representation in the national councils pi
which, from our earliest history, has boen uniformly acÂ­ bi
corded to each Territory established from time to time
within our limits. It maintains peculiar relations to
Congress, to whom the Constitution has granted the la
power of exercising exclusive legislation over the seat B
of Government. Our fellow-citizens residing in the DieÂ­ I
trict, whose interests are thus confided to the speciali
guardianship of Congress, exceed in number the populaÂ­ I
tion of several of our Territories, and no just reason is ti
perceived why a delegate of their choice should not ibe
admitted to a seat in the House of Representatives. No
mode seems so appropriate and effectual of enabling
them to make known their peculiar condition and wants. I
and of securing the local legislation adapted to them. I
therefore recommend the passage of a law authorizing ii
the electors of the District of Columbia to choose a deleÂ­
gate, to be allowed the same rights and privileges as a
I delegate representing a Territory. The increasing enÂ­ t
Sterprise and rapid progress of improvement in the D)isÂ­
Strict are highly gratifying, and I trust that the efforts of
the municipal authorities to promote the prosperity of
the national metropolis will receive the efficient anst
generous coiiperation of Congress.

It is a subject of congratulation that no foreign comÂ­ t

SelexLan Affars.
bh In the month of April last, as Congress is aware, a
.y friendly arrangement was made between the Emperor of
5rÂ­ France and the Presidentef the United States for the with

 drawal from Mexico of the French military expeditionary uj
forces. This withdrawal was to be effected in three deÂ­ tl
tachments, the first of which, it was understood, would In
leave Mexico in November, now past, the second in st
March next, and the third and last in November, 1867. pi
Immediately upon the completion of the evacuation the tr
French Government was to assume the same attitude of si
non-intervention, in regard to Mexico, as is-held by the it
Government of the United States. Repeated assurances S
have been given by the Emperor, since that agreement, at
that he would complete the promised evacuation within sa
the period mentioned, or sooner.
It was reasonably expected that the proceedings thus Si
contemplated would produce a crisis of great political :nÂ­ S
terest in the Republic of Mexico. The newly-appointed f
Minister of the United States, Mr. Campbell, was thereÂ­ re
fore sent forward, on the 9th day of November last, to
avsume his proper flnctions as Minister Plenipotentiary
of the United States to that Republic. It was also C
thought expedient that he should be attended in the viÂ­ ti
cinity of Mexico Iby the Lieutenant General of the Army oi
of the United States, with the view of obtaining suchlinÂ­ s
formation as might be important to determine the course ""
to be pursued by the United States in reestablishing and P'
maintaining necessary and proper intercourse with the Pi
Republic of Mexico. Deeply interested in the oause of of
liberty and humanity, it seemed an obvious duty on our fr
part to exorcise whatever influence we possessed for the di
restoration and pertnanent establishment in that country P
of a domestic and republican form of government. I
Such was the conditionr of affairs in regard to Mexico, h
when, on the 22d of November last, official information 0
was received from Paris that the Emperor of France had cc
some time before decided not to withdraw a detachment tl
of his forces in the month of November past, according P
to engagement, but that this decision was made with the
purpose of withdrawing the whole of those forces in the
ensuing spring. Of this determination, however, the
United States had not received any notice or intimation;
and, so soon as the information was received by the GoÂ­
vernment, care was taken to make known its dissent to
the Emperor of France.
I cannot forego the hope that France will reconsider
the subject, and adopt some resolution in regard to the
evacuation of Mexico which will conform as nearly as pracÂ­
ticablowith the existing engagement, and thus meet the
just expectations of the United States. The papers relaÂ­
ting to the subject will he laid before you. It is believed
that, with the evacuation of Mexico by the expedition
ary forces, no subject for serious difference between
France and the United States would remain. The exÂ­
Spressions of the Emperor and people of France warrant a
hope that the traditionary friendship between the two
countries might in that case be renewed and permanently
restored.
A claim of a citizen of the United States for indemnity
for Ppoliations committed on the high seas by the French
authorities, in the exercise of a belligerent power against
Mexico, has been met by the Government of France with
a proposition to defer settlement until a mutual convenÂ­
tion for the adjustment of all claims of .citizens and subÂ­
I jects of both countries, arising out of the recent wars on
this Continent, shall be agreed upon by the two counÂ­
tries. The suggestion is not deemed unreasonable, but
1it belongs to Congress to direct the manner in which
claims for indemnity by foreigners, as well as by citizens
of the Unitel States, arising out of the late civil war,
shall l,e adjudicated and determined. I have no doubt
that the subject of all such claims will engage your atÂ­
tention at a convenient and proper time.
Affair With Great Britanla.
It is a matter of regret that no considerable advance
ha, bien made! towardi. an adjustment of the differences
I I, twceen the United States and Great Britain, arising out
,i,-f thie Iiprelations upon our national commerce and
Sother
trespJsses committed during our civil war by BriÂ­
tish snuhjcts, in violation of international law and treaty
Sobligations. The delay, however, may be believed to
1 have resulted in no small degree from the domestic
Situation of Great Britain. An entire change of ministry
. occurred in that country during the last session of ParÂ­
liament. The attention of the new ministry was called
to the subject at an early day, and there is some reason
to expect that it will now be considered in a becoming
1I aund friendly spirit. The importance of an early dispoÂ­
t
sition of the questilon cannot be exaggerated. Whatever
night te the wishes of the two Governments, it is maniÂ­
fest that good will and friendship between the two counÂ­
tries cannot be established until a reciprocity, in the
practice of gocrl faith and neutrality, shall be restored
between the respective nations.
The Fenians.
On the 6th of Jane last, in violation of our neutrality
a laws, a military expedition and enterprise against the
British North American Colonies was projected and atÂ­
tempted to be carried on within the territory and jurisÂ­
.1
diction of the United States. In obedience to the
obligation imposed upon the Executive by the ConstitnÂ­
s tion, to see that the laws are faithfully executed, all
e citizens were warned, by proclamation, against
taking part in or aiding such' unlawful proÂ­
g ceedings, and the proper, civil, military, and naval
officers were directed to take all necessary measures for
the enforcement of the laws. The expedition failed, but
g lit has not been without its painful consequences. Some
of our citizens who, it was alleged, were engaged in the
e xpedition, were captured, and have been brought to
Strial as for a capital offence in the province of Canada.
f Cudgment and sentence of death have been pronounced
Sagainstr some, while others have been agcquitted. Fully
Iselieriig in the maxim of government that severity of
Scivil puiishment for misguided persons who have enÂ­
i gaged in revolutionary attempts which have disastrously
fi ailed is unsonmd and unwise, such representations have
ibeen made tI, the British Government, in behalf of the
'convicted persinS. as. biing sustained by an enlightened
"" andl humane jud.mwnt, will, it is hoped, induce in their
Srases an exercise of clemency, and a judicious amnesty
Srt all who were snrasead in the movemaent. Counsnel has


been emnploye by the (;overnment to defend citizens of
- the I nited States on trial fior capital offences in [Canada.
er and a discontinuance of the prosecutions which were inÂ­
(1 stituted in the courts of the United States against those
, who took part in the expedition has been directed.
re I have regarded the expedition as not only political in
is its nature, but as also in a great measure foreign from the
Inited States in its causes, character. and objects. The
attempt was understood to be made in sympathy with an
, insurgent party in Ireland, and, by striking at a British
dÂ­ province on this continent, was .designed to aid in obÂ­
xi taining redress for political grievances which, it was asÂ­
e sumed, the people of Ireland had suffered at the bhands
at of the British Grovernment during a period of several
centuries. The persons engaged in it were chiefly naÂ­
'h tives of that country, some of whom had, while others
sh had not, become citizens of the United States under our
in general laws of naturalization. Complaints of misgoÂ­
vernment in Ireland continually engage the attention of
the British nation, and so great an agitation is now preÂ­
ne vailing in Ireland that the British Government have
us deemed it necessary to suspend the writ of habeas corpus
as in that country. These circumstances must necessarily
inÂ­ modify the opinion which we might otherwise have enÂ­
tct tertained in regard to an expedition expressly prohibited
by our neutrality laws. So long as those laws remain
upon our statute books they shouldbe faithfully execuÂ­
of ted, and if they operate harshly, unjustly, or oppresÂ­
n, sively, Congress alone can apply the remedy by their
ad modification or repeal.
ral Political and commercial interests of the United States
are not unlikely to be affected in some degree by events
which are transpiring in the eastern regions of Europe,
hÂ­ and the time seems to have come when our Government
dÂ­ ought to have a proper diplomatic representation in
ed Greece.
Ild This Government has claimed for all persons not conÂ­
an victed, or accused, or suspected of crime, an absolute poÂ­
arÂ­
litical right of self-expatriation, and a choice of new naÂ­
tional allegiance. Most of the European States have
ill dissented from this principle, and have elaimed a right to
a hold such of their subjects as have immigrated to and
ls ieen naturalized in the United States, and afterwards reÂ­
m turned on transient visits to their native countries, to the
performance of military service in like manner as resident
subjects. Complaints arising from the claim in this reÂ­
a spect made by foreign States, have heretofore been matÂ­
of ters of controversy between the United States and some
th of the European Powers, and the irritation eonsequent




 upon the failure to settle this question ineremed dudlng
the war in which Prussia, Italy, andAustria were recently
engaged. While Great Britain has never acknowledged
the right of expatriation, she has not for some years
past practically insisted upon thd opposite doeÂ­
trine. France has been equally forbearing; and PeroÂ­
sia has proposed a compromise, which, although evincing
increased liberality, has not been accepted by the United
States. Peace is now prevailing everywhere in Europe,
and the present seems to be a favorable time flr an asÂ­
sertion by Congress of the principle, so long maintained
by the Executive Department, that naturalization by one
State fully exempts the native-born subject of any other
State from the performance of military service under any
oreign Government, so long as he does not voluntarily
renounce its rights and benefits.
Conclusion.
In the performance of a duty imposed upon me by the
Constitution, Ihave thus submitted to the Represeata
tives of the States and of the people snob information o
our domestic and foreign affairs a a the publio interetta
seem to require. Our Government is now undergoing its
most trying ordeal, and my earnest prayer is, that the
,peril may be successfully and finally passed, without firP
pairing its original strength and symmetry. The intesta
of the nation are best to be promoted by the revival of
fraternal relations, the complete obliteration of our pas
differences, and the reinauguration of all the pursuits of
peace. Directing our efforts to the early accomplish.
ment of these great ends, let us endeavor to pesarve
harmony between the co-ordinate Departments of the
Government, that each in its proper sphere may cordially
co-operate with the other in securing the maintdance d
the Constitution, the preservation of the Union, ad the
perpetuity of our free institutions.

The Unusual Experience of a Prominent

The following article from the Democrat and

ing a nature, and emanates from so reliable a
source, that it is herewith re-publlshed entire,
In addition to the valuable matter it contains,
it will be found exceedingly interesting.
To the Editor of the Democrat and Chronicle:
Sib: My motives for the publication of the
most unusual statements which follow are,
first, gratitude for the fact"" that 1 have been
saved from a most horrible death, and, secondÂ­
ly, a desire to warn all who read this stateÂ­
ment against some of the most deceptive inÂ­
fluences by which they have ever been surÂ­
rounded. It is a fact that to-day thousands
of people are within a foot of the grave and
ihey do not know it. To tell how I was
caught away from just this position, and to
warn others against ntaring it, are my objects
in this communication.
On the first day of June, 1881, 1 lay at my
residence in this city surrounded by my friends
and waiting for mv death. Heaven only
knows the agony I then endured, for words
can never describe it. And yet, if a few years
previous, any one had told me that I was to be
brought so low, and by so terrible a disease, I
should have scoffed at the idea. I had always
been uncommonly strong and healthy, had
weighed over 20J pounds and hardly knew, in
my own experience, what pain or sickness
were. Very m iny neople who will read this
statement realize at times that they are unÂ­
usually tired and cannot account for it. They
feel dull and indefinite pains in various parts
of the body and do not understand it. Or
they are exceedingly hungry one day and enÂ­
tirely without appetite the next. This was
just the way I felt when the relentless malady
which had fastened itself upon me first began.
StiU I thought it was nothing; that probably
I had taken a cold which would soon pass
away. Shortly after this I noticed a dull, and
at times a neuralgic pain in my head, but as
it would coma one day and be gone the next,
I paid but little attention to it. However, my
stomach was out of order and my food often
failed to digest, causing at times great inÂ­
convenience. Yet I had no idea, even as a
physician, that these things meant anything
serious or that a monstrous disease was beÂ­
coming fixed upon me. ' Candidly, I thought
I was suffering from Malaria and so doctored
myself accordingly. But I got no better. I
next noticed a j ecullar color and odor about
the fluids I was passing also that there were
large quantities one day and very little the
next, and that a persistent froth and scum apÂ­
peared upon the surface, and a sediment setÂ­
tled in the bottom. And yet I did not realize
;y dancer, for, indeed, seeing these sympÂ­
toms continually, I finally became accustomed
to them, and my suspicion was wholly disÂ­
armed by the fact that I had no pain in the
affected organs or in their vicinity. . Why I
shoutd have been so blind 1 cannot understand.
There is a terrible future for all physical
neglect, and impending danger always brings
a person to his senses even though it may then
be too late. I realized, at last, my critical
condition and aroused myself to overcome it.
And, Oh 1 how hard I tried 1 I consulted the
best medic d skill in the land. I visited all
the prominent mineral springs in America and
traveled from Maine to California Still I
grew worse. No two physicians agreed as to
my malady. One said ' 1 was troubled with
spinal irritation; another, nervous prostraÂ­
tion; another, malaria; another, dyspepsia;
another, heart-disease; another, general deÂ­
bility; another, congestion of the base of the
brain; and so on throu rh a long list of comÂ­
mon diseases, the symptoms of all of which I
re.d'y had. In this way several years passed,
during sll of which time I was stddily growÂ­
ing worse. Mv condition had really become
pitiable. The slight symptoms I at first exÂ­
perienced were developed into terrible and
constant disorders the little twigs of pain
had grown to oaks of agony. My weight had
been re luced from 207 to 13 pounds. My life
was a torture to myself and friends. I could
retain no food upon my stomach, and lived
wholly bv injections. Twas a . living mass of
pain. My pulse was uncontrollable. In my
ago-y I frequent v fell upon the floor, conÂ­
vulsively clutched the carret; and prayed for
deith. Morphine had little or no effect in
de dening the nain. For six dnys and nights
I had the death-premonitory hiccoughs conÂ­
stantly. My urine Wis filie I with tube casts
and albumen. I was struggling with Bright'
Disease of the Kidneys in its last stages.

While suffering thus I received a call from
my pastor, the Rev. Dr. Foote, rector of St.
Paul's Church, of this city. I felt that it was
our last interview, but in the course of con
venation he mentioned a remedy of ""which I
had heard much bat had never used. Dr.
Foote detailed to . me the many remarkable
cures which had come under his observation,
by means of this remedy, and urged me to try
it. As a practicing physician and a graduate
of the schools, I cherished the prejudice both
natural and common with all regularpractitioners,-and
derided the idea of any medicine
outside the regular channels being the least
beneficial. So solicitous, however, was Dr.

Foote, that I finally promised I would waive.
my prejudice ana try ine remeay ne so nigniy
recommended. I began its use on the 1st day
of June and took it according to directions.
At first it sickened! me; but this I thought
was a good sign for me in my debilitated conÂ­
dition. I continued to take it; the sickening
sensation departed and I was able to retain
food upon my stomach. In a few days I noÂ­
ticed a decided change for the better s also
did my wife and iriends. My hiccouirhs ceased
and I experienced less pain than formerly. I
was so rejoiced at this improved condition
that, upon what I had believed but a few days
before was my dying bed, I vowed,, in the
preseuce of my family and friends, should I
recover I would both publicly and privately
make known this remedy for the good of huÂ­
manity, wherever and whenever I had an opÂ­
portunity. I also determined that I would
give a course of lectures in the Corinthian
Academy of Music of this city, stating in full
the symptoms and almost hopelessness of my
disease and the remarkable means by which I
have been saved. My improvement was conÂ­
stant from that time, and in less than three
months I had gained 26 pounds in flesh, beÂ­
came entirely free from pain, and I believe I
owe xay life and present condition wholly to
Warner's Safe Kidney and Liver Cure, the
remedy which I used.
Since my recovery I have thoroughlyre-investigated
the subject of kidney difficulties
ind"" Bl ight's disease, and the truths developed
are astounding. I therefore state, deliberateÂ­
ly, and as a physician, that I believe that more
than one-half the 'deaths which occur in
America are caused by Bright's disease of the
kidneys.', This may sound like a rash stateÂ­
ment, but I am prepared to , fully verify it.
Bright's disease has no distinctive symptoms
of its own (indeed, it oiten develops without
any pain (Whatever in the kidneys or their
Vicinity), but has the symptoms of nearlyev-ery-other-
known complaint. Hundreds of
people die daily, whose burials are authorized
by a. physician's certificate of ""Heart DisÂ­
ease;"" ""Apoplexy,"" ""Par.ilysis,"" ""Spinal
Coinplaint,"" "" Kheumatism,"""""" Pneumonia,""
and ether common complaints, when in reality
if, was Bright's Disease ot the Kidneys. Few
physicians, and fewer people, realize the exÂ­
tent of this disease or its dangerous and inÂ­
sidious nature. It steaU into the systemlike
a thief, manifests its presence by the comÂ­
monest symptoms, and fastens itself upon the
constitution before the victim is aware. It is
nearly as hereditary as consumption, quite as
commou and fully as fatal. Entire fa liilie.,
inheriting it from , their ancestors, have died,
and yet none of the number knew or realized
the mysterious power which was removing
them. Instead of common symptoms it ofteu
shows none whatever, but brings death sudÂ­
denly, and as such is-usually supposed to be
heart-disease. As one who has suffered, and
knows by bitter experience what he says, I
implore every one who reads these words not
to neglect the slightest symptoms of Kidney
difficulty. Certain agony and possible death
will be the sure result of such neglect, and no
one can afford to hazard such chances.
. I ; m aware that such an unqualified stateÂ­
ment as this, coming from me, known as I
am throughout the entire land as a practitionÂ­
er and lecturer, will arouse the surprise and
possible animosity of the medical profession
and astonish all with whom I am acquainted,
but I make the foregoing statements based
upon facts which I am prepared to produce
and truths which I can substantiate to the
letter. The welfare of those who may possiÂ­
bly be sufferers such as I was, is an ample inÂ­
ducement for me to take the step I have, and
if I can successfully warn others from the
dangerous path in which I once walked, I am
willing to endure all professional and personal
consequences. J. B. HENION, M. D.

He says : â€” I read with surprise the fatal effects of diphtheria in and about Castlt-maineâ€” an epidemic, according to an extiait from the Mount Alexander Mail, clinging to the town with fatal tenacity. Should you, or any of your family, be attacked, do not be alarmed , as it iB both easily and speedily cured. When it was raging in England a few years ago I accompanied Dr. Field on his rounds, both in town and country, to witnesB the so-called 4 'wonderful cures' he performed, while the patients of medical men were dropping off on all sides. Of course, the remedy, to be so efficacious and rapid, must be eimple. All that he took with him was powder of sulphur and a quill, and with these he cured every patient, without a single exception. He put a large teaspoonf ul of the flour of brimstone into a wine-glass of water, and, instead of a spoon, he used his fingar in stirring it, as the sulphur does not readily amalgamate with water ; and as the sulphur was pretty well mixed, he gave it as a gargle, and in ten minutes the patient was out of danger â€” brimstone killing every species of fungus in man, beast, and plant in a few minuteB. Instead of spitting the gargle out, as usual, he recommended the patient to swallow it. In extreme cases to which he had been called just ' in the nick of time' to rescue the sufferer from death, where the fungus was too nearly closing to admit of sufficient breath passiuy to enable the patient to gargle, he blew the sulphur into the throat through a quill, and When the iungUB had shrunk sufficiently to admit of sufficient wind passing to gargle, he ad'ministered the whole, occupying a few minutes only â€” and he never losfcapatient from diphtheria. If you should meet with a patient that cannot gargle, take a live coal (stone or wood) from the fire, puc it on a shovel, and sprinkle the flour of brimstone upon it â€” a spoonful or two at a t'ine â€” and lot the sufferer inhale it, holding the head over it, and the fungus will die. If plentifully wed, the whole room will be filled almost to aaffocation, and the patient may walk about inhaling the fumes, with the doors and windows shut.

Statesmen, who are worthy of the appellation

Jefferson died comparatively poor. Indeed,

Madison saved money, and was comparati velv

to those of his widow, Congress purchased his
manuscript papers, and paid thirty thousand
dollars for tiiein.
James Monroe, the sixth President of the
United States, died in this city, so poor that his
remains found a resting-place through the chariÂ­

cemetery in Second street, but no monument
marks the spot where they repose.

Valth the Christian's Invincible Weapon
In th Conflict Men Argument
Nothing Before the TestimoÂ­
ny of Wltneiaes.
""The Facts Proved"" was the subject of
Rev. T. DeWitt Talmage's fifth sermon at
""The Eamptons,"" the discourse being
founded on the following text:
We are witnesses. Acts lii., 13.
In the days of George Stephenson, the
yerfecter of the locomotive engine, the
scientists proved conclusively that a railÂ­
way train could never be driven by steam
power successfully and without peril ; but
the rushing express trains from Liverpool
to Edinburg, and from Edinburg to LonÂ­
don, have made all the nation witnesses of
the splendid achievement. Machinists
and navigators proved conclusively that a
steamer could never cross the Atlantic
ocean; but no sooner had they successfully
proved the impossibility of such an under
takes: than the work was done, and the
passengers on the Cunard, and the Inman,
and the National, and the White Htar lines
are witnesses. There went up a guffaw
Of wise laughter at Prof. Morse's
proposition to make the lightning of
Heaven his errand boy, and it was proved
conclusively that the thing could never bo
done; but now all the news of the wide
world, put In your hands every morning
and night, has made all nations witnesses.
So in the time of Christ it was proved
conclusively that it was impossible for
him to rise from the dead. It was shown
logically that when a man was dead he
was dead, and the heart and
the liver and the lungs having ceased to
perform their offices, the limbs would be
rigid beyond all power of friction or
arousal. They showed it to be an abso
lute absurdity that the dead Christ should
get up alive; but no sooner had they
proved this than the dead Christ arose,
and the disciples beheld him, and they
took the witness-stand to prove that to be
true which the wiseacres of the day had
proved to be impossible; the record of the
experiment and of the testimony is In the
text:
mm hath Ood raised from the dead, whereof
we are witnesses.
Now, let me play the skeptic for a moÂ­
Dent.""There Is no Ood."" savs the skeptic, ""for
I have never seen him with my physical
eyesight. Tour Bible is a pack of contra
dictions. There never was a miracle.
Lazarus was not raised from the dead,
and the water was never turned into
wine. Your religion is an imposition on
the credulity of the ages.""
There is an aired man movinir In that
pew as though he would like to respond.
Here are hundreds of people witn races a
little flushed at these announcements, and
all through this house there is a supÂ­
pressed feeling which would like to speak
out in behalf of the truth of our glorious
Christianity, as in the days of the text,
crying out:
We are witnesses.
The fact is. that If this world Is ever
brought to God it will not be through ar
arument. but through testimony. You
might cover the whole earth with apolo
gies for Christianity and learned treatises
in defense of religion you would
not convert a soul. Lectures
on the harmony between science
and religion are beautiful mental discipÂ­
line, but have never saved a soul, and
tlever will save a soul. Put a man of the
world and a man of the church against
each other, and the man of the world will
in all probability s:et the Itriumph. There
are a thousand things in our religion that
seems illogical to the world, and always
will seem illogical.
Our weapon in this conflict is faith, not
loeric: faith, not metaphysics; faith, not
profundity; faith, not scholastic explora
tion. But, then, in order to have faith, we
must have testimony, and If ooo men, or
1,000 men, or 600,000 men. or 6,000,000 men
get up and tell me that they have felt the
reliaion of Jesus Christ a joy, a comfort, a
help, an inspiration, I am bound as a fair
minded man to accept their testimony. I
want just now to put before you three
propositions, the truth of which I think
this audience will attest with overwhelm
ing unanimity.
The first proposition is: We are wit
nouses that the religion of Christ is able to
convert a soul.
The Gospel may have had a hard time to
conquer ns, we may have fought it back,
but we were vanquished. You Say con
version is only an imaginary thing. We
know better.
We are witnesses.
There never was so great a change in
our heart and life on any other subject as
on this. People laughed at the mission
ariw in Madagascar because they preached
ten years without one convert; but there
are thirty-three thousand converts in Mad
agascar to-day.
People laughed at Dr. Judson, the Bap
tist missionary, because he kept on preach
ing in Burmah five years without a single
convert; but there are twenty thousand
Baptists in Burmah to-day. People
laughed at Dr. Morrison, in China, for
breaching there seven years without a
single conversion; but there are fifteen
thousand Christians in China to-day. Peo
ple laughed at the missionaries for preach-
ing at Tahiti for fifteen years without a
single conversion, and at the missionaries
for preaching in Bengal seventeen years
Without a single conversion; yet in all
those lands there are multitudes of Chris
tians to-day.
But why go so far to find evidences of
the Gospel's power to save a soul
We are witnesses.
We were so proud that no man could
have humbled us; we were so hard that no
earthly power could have melted us
angels of Ood were all around about us,
they could not overcome us ; but one day,
perhaps at a Methodist anxious-seat, or at
a Presbyterian catechetical lecture, or at
a burial, or on horseback, a power seized
us, and made us get down, and made us
tremble, and made us kneel, and made us
cry for mercy ; and we tried to wrench
ourselves away from the grasp, but we
could not. It flung us flat, and when we
arose we were as much changed as
Gom-Bfls. the heathen, who went into a
praver-meeting with a dagger and a gun
to disturb the meeting and destroy it, but
the next day was found crying:
""Ohl my great sins! Oh I my great
Saviour 1"" and for eleven years he preached
the Gospel of Christ to bis fellow-moun
taineers, the last words on his dying lips
being.
""Free grace!""
Oh, it was free grace!
There is a man who was for ten years a
hard drinker. The dreadful appetite had
sent down its roots around the palate and
the tongue, and on down until they were
interlluked with the vitals of body, mind

lants for two years. What did that? Not
temperance societies. Not prohibition
laws. Not moral suasion. Conversion did
it.
""Why,"" said one upon whom the great
chance had come, ""sir, I feel just as
though I were somebody else.""
There is a sea captain who swore all the
way from New York to Havana and from
Havana to Han Francisco, an I when he
was in port he was worse thaa when he
was on the sea. What power was it that
washed his tongue clvan of profanities and
made him a psalm-singer? Conversion by
the Holy Spirit.
There are thousands of people in this
house to-night who are no more what they
once were than a water-lily is nightshade,
or a morning lark is a vulture, or day is
night.
Now, if I should demand that all these
people in this house who have felt the
converting power of religion should rise,
so far from being ashamed, they would
spring to their feet with more alacrity than
thev ever sprang to the 'dance, the tears
mingling with their exhilaration, as they
cr lad:
We are witnesses.
And if they tried to sing the old Gospel
bymn, they would break down with emoÂ­
tion by the time they got to the texTud
line:
Ashamed ot Jesus, that dear friend,
On wtioni niy hopes of Heavea depenuf

What poor advice. Get your V off of

you of what you have lost. Get yoi mind
off of it. They might as well advi vou

Why, along that very street, or that very
road, she once accompanied you. Out of
that grass plot she once plucked flowers,
or into that show window she looked,
fascinated, saying:
""Come, see the pictures.""
Go deeper into business ! Why, she was
associated with all your business ambition,
and since she has gone you have no ambiÂ­
tion left.
Oh, this is a clumsy world when it tries
to comfort a broken heart ! I can build a
Corliss engine, I can paint a Raphael's
""Madonna,"" I can play a Beethoven's
""Symphony"" as easily as this world cam

Did Christ come trt 'ydii and say:
Get your mind- off this; go out arwi

No. There was a minute -Their ne' came

out the photograph of the departed one and
look into the eyes and the face of the dear
one, and say:
""It is all right; she is better off; I would
not call her lack. Lord, I thank thee that
thou hast comforted my poor heart.""
There are Christian parents here who are
willing to testify to the power of this
Gospel to comfort. Your son had just
graduated from school or college, and was
ifoinir into business, and the ljord toon
him. Or your daughter had just gradu
ated from the young ladies' seminary, and
you thought she was going to be a useful
woman and of long me; but the lora tooR
her, and you were tempted to say:
All this culture of twenty years for
nothing !""
Or the little child came home from school
with the hot fever that stopped not for the
agonized prayer or for the skillful physi
cian, and the little child was taken. Or
the babe was lifted out of your arms by
some quick epidemic, and you stood won
dering: why God ever gave you that child
at all, if so soon He was to take it away.
And yet you are not repining, you are not
fretful, you are not fighting against God.
What has enabled vou to stand all the
trial?
Oh,"" you say, ""I took the medicine that
God cave mv sick soul. In my distress I
threw myself at the feet of a sympathiz
ing God; and when I was too weak to
pray, or to look up, he breathed into me a
peace that I think must be the foretaste of
that Heaven where there is neither a tear,
nor a farewell, nor a grave.""
Come, all ye who have been out to the
grave to weep there come, all ye comfortÂ­
ed souls, get up oft your knees. Is there
no power in this Gospel to soothe the heart?
Is there no power in this religion to quiet
the worst paroxysm of grief f There comes
up an answer from comforted widowhood,
and orphanage, and childlessness, saying:
""Aye, aye, we are witnesses ;""
Again, I remark that we are witnesses
of the fact that religion has power to give
composure in tho last moment. I shall
never forget tho first time I confronted
death. We went across the corn fields in
the country. I was led by my father's
hand, and we came to the farm house
where the bereavement had come, and we
saw the crowd of wagons and carriages;
but there was one carriage that especially
attracted by boyish attention, and it had
black plumes. I said:
""What's that? what's that? Why those
black tassels at the top?""
After it was explained to me, I was
lifted up to look upon the bright f.ce of an
aged Christian woman, who three days
before had departed in triumph. The
whole scene made an impression I never
forgot.
In our sermons and in our lay exhorta
tions we are very apt, when we want to
bring illustrations of dying triumph, to go
back to some distinguished persona;
to a John Knox or a Harriet Newell. But
I want you for witnesses.
I want to know if you have ever seen
anything to make you believe that the re
ligion of Christ can give composure in the
final hour. Now, in the courts, attorney,
jury and judge will never admit mere
hearsay. They demand that the witness
must have seen with his own eyes or heard
with his own ears, and so I am critical in
my examination of you now; and I want
to know whether you have seen or heard
anything that makes you believe that the
relisriou of Christ gives composure in the
final hour.
""Oh, yes,"" you say, ""I saw my father
and mother depart. There was a great
difference in their death beds. Standin
by the one we felt more veneration. By
the other there was more tenderness.""
Before the one you bowed perhaps in awe.
In the other case you felt as if you would
like to go along with her. How did they
feel in that last hour? How did they
seem to act? Were they very much
frichtened? Did thev take hold of this
world with both hands, as though they
did not want to give it up?
""Oh, 110,"". you say; ""no, I remember as
though it were yesterday; she had a kind
word for us all. and there were a few
mementoes distributed among the chil
dren. and then she told us how kind we
must be to our father in his loneliness,
and then she kissed us good-by and went
asleep as a child in a cradle.""
What made her so composed? Natural
courage?
""No,"" you say, ""mother was very nerv
ous; when the carriage inclined to the side
of the road she would cry out; she was al
ways rather weakly.""
AVhat, then, gave her composure? Was
it because she did not care much for you,
and the pangs of parting were not great?
""Oh,"" you say, ""she showered upon us
a wealth of affection; no mother ever
loved her children more than mother loved
us; she showed it by the way she nursed
us when we were sick, and she toiled for
us until her strength gave out.""
What, then, was it that gave her com
posure in the last hour? Do not hide it.
Be frank and let me know.
""Oh,"" you say, it was because she was
so good; she made the Iord her portion,
and she had laith that she would go
straight to glory and that we should all
meet her at last at the foot of the throne.""
Here are people who say: ""I saw a
Christian brother die, and he triumphed.""
And some one else: ""I saw a Christian
sister die, and she triumphed.""
Some one else will sav : ""I saw a Chris
tian daughter die, and she triumphed.""
Come', ail ve who have seen the last mo
ments of a Christian, and give testimony
in this cause on trial. Uncover your
heads, put your band en the old family
Bible, from which they used to read
the promises, and promise in the presence
of high Heaven that you will tell
the truth, the whole truth and
nothing but the truth. With what you
have seen with your own eyes, and from
what you have heard with your own ears,
is there power in this Gospel to give calm
ness and triumph in the last exigency?
The response comes from all sides, from
young and old, and middle-aged:
We are witnesses.
You see, my friends, I have not put beÂ­
fore you an abstraction, or a chimera, or
any thing like guess work. I present you
affidavits of the best men and women, liv
ing or dead. Two witnesses in court will
establish a fact. Here are not two witÂ­
nesses, but thousands of witnesses on
earth millions of witnesses, and in Heaven
a great multitude of witnesses that no
man can number, testifying that there is
power in this religion to convert the soul,
tf givecomfort in trouble and to afford

composure in ice ianz cqur.
If ten men should come to you when you,
are sick with appalling sickness, and.say
they had the same fcii-kiwss, and took a
certain medicine and it cured them, you
would probably take it. Now suppose ten
other men should come up aud say:
""We dou't believe there is any thing in

GIRLS AND BOYS.
Common-lcme Ilintg for Their Galdanee
In Youthful Hours.
Young girls rarely are conscious of th
power they exert over the young men with
whom they are brought into contact.
Their standards influence th,e conduct of
young men while they are in their presÂ­
ence, if at no other time.
A young lady who will allow loud ana
boisterous conversation, familiar manner,
inolegant attitudes, careless reference to
? hurch and church rcembers takes down
the barriers that should be maintained be
tween herself and her gentleman friends.
It may appear that she makes herself
more attractive by this f reeom, but it is
not so. No girl is attractive to a gentleÂ­
man who does not maintaia a gentle,
womanly dignity, and by her aStitude pre
vent a slipping away from the nvcest conÂ­
ventionalities of society. In the deeper
matters things affecting life in its spiritÂ­
ual and moral side a girl has a greater
influence than she dreams.
A very safe rule governing the relations
between herself and her gentleman
friends for a girl to make is to never per
mit a word, a subject of conversation, to
take place between a gentleman and her
self that she would hesitate to have
spoken or discussed in the presence of
father, mother or brother, and this will
be no bar to a pleasant, entertaining and
fun making intercourse, but it will preÂ­
vent the use of slang, the discussion of silÂ­
ly themes and trifling with subjects that
are, and should be, sacred to every young
man and woman governed by refined and
righteous principles.
Girls love pretty things as naturally aa
the bees love sunshine. It is not to be
granted that boys are not susceptible to
beauty in various shapes also; but to the
feminine portion of humanity ccmes the
greater share of the love of the beautiful.
In tho home life, where so many girls ara
of necessity kept until they are grown to
womanhood, the opportunity for beautifyÂ­
ing themselves as well as their surroundÂ­
ings is often lost because the father psrÂ­
haps, and occasiona.ly the mother also,
has grown to think that simple prettiness
is of ni possible use. They have outÂ­
grown their youthful thoughts, follies ia
their eyes now, and have learned to say,
What's its use to every thing new.
If a girl in her home life be allowed to
rearranga the rooms according to her
taste, to bring into the living room plants
or simply her flowers, to occasionally havo
some new ornament, cheap in many cases
it may be, but have its newness a thing of
beauty, and not have some one saying:
""It's useless; it can neither be eaten nor
worn"" she will take much more comfort,
and care much more for her father's home.
There aro fathers who love their
daughters as well as they know how and
still they never allow them to think money
er time can be spent on any thing that is
not in itself of some obvious use; they
pooh-pooh at the idea oT a flower bed; they
object to vines on the house because they
are rubbish, and the idea of a prettily furÂ­
nished room, either for the family or for
the daughter herself, is an unheard of
folly.
When these girls go out from the barren
home life, what wonder that they saidoni
know how to act in a pleasantly appointed
home ! and more, what wonder that tho
trusting, loving heart sometimes is too
easily led astray through promises of a
pretty home. A"". T. Jltrald","unknown"

The Largest Farm in the World.
In the extreme southwest corner of
Louisiana lies the largest producing farm
in the world. It runs 100 miles north and
south and many miles east and west, and
is owned and operated by a syndicate of
northern capitalists, says the St. Louis IdÂ­
1pilclian. Their general manager, J. 3.
Watkins, gives an interesting account of
this gigantic plantation, which throws the
great Dalrymple farm in Dakota into the
shade completely.
""The 1,500,000 acres of our tract,"" M'r.
Watkins said, ""was purchased in 1883 from
the United States government. At that
time it was a vast grazing land for the catÂ­
tle of the few dealers in the neighborhood.
When I took possession I found over 30,Â­
000 head of half wild horses end cattle.
My work was to divide the immense tract
into convenient pastures establishing staÂ­
tions. or ranches every six miles. The
fencing alone cost in the neighborhood of
$50,000. The land I found adapted to
rice, sugar, corn and cotton.
""All our cultivating, ditching, etc., is
done by steam power. We take a tract,

place an engine on each side. The enÂ­

tached to four plows, and under this arÂ­
rangements we are able to plow 30 acres a
day with only the labor of three men.

The government has only to make good its promises,

The government is, therefore, the sole delinquent.
The amount of legal tender notes of the United
States now outstanding is less than $370,000,000, beÂ­

sented forgedemption, and such inconsiderable porÂ­
tions of it sl tenders as individuals may from time
to time Aire to convert for special use, or in order
to lay by in coin their little storeset money.
COIN RESERVES.
So, make the coin now in the treasuryavailablefor
the objects of this reserve. To gradually strengthen
and enlarge that reserve, and to provide for such
other exceptional demands for coin as may arise,
does not seem to me a work of difficulty. If wisely
planned and discreetly pursued, it might not cost
any sacrifices to the business of the country. it
should tend, on the contrary, to a revival of hope
and confidence. The coin in the treasury on the
thirteenth of June, including what is held against
coin certificates, amounted to seventy-Sour millions.
The current of precious metals which has flowed out
of our country fortheeleven years, fromJuly 1,1865,
to June 30, 1875, averaging nearly seventy-six milÂ­
lions a year, was eight hundred and thirty-two milÂ­
lions, in the whole period of which six hundred and
seventeen millions were the product of our own mines.
To amass the requisite quantity by intercepting from
the current flowing out of the country, and from
stocks which exists abroad without disturbing the
equilibrium of the foreign money markets, is a result
to be easily worked out by practical knowledge and
judgment.
SURPLUS OF LEGAL-TENDERS.
With resject to whatever surplus of legal tenders
the wants of business may fail to keep in use and
which in order to sale the interest, will be returned
for redemption they can either be paid or they can
be funded. Whether they mature as currency or be
absorbed into the vast mass of securities held as inÂ­
vestments. ts merely a question of the rate of interÂ­
est they draw. Even if they were to remain in
their present form and the government were to agree
to pay on them a rate of interest making them deÂ­
sirable as investments, they would cease to circulate
and take their place with government, state, municÂ­
ipal and other corporate and private demands of
which thousands of millions exist among as. In the
perfect ease with which they can be changed from
currency into investments, lies the only'danger tobe
guarded againstin the adoption of general measures
intended to remove im clearly ascertained surplus,
that is, a withdrawal of any which are not a permaÂ­
neat excess beyond the wants of business. Even
more mischievous would be .sny measure which afÂ­
fects public imagination with the fear of an appreÂ­
hended scarcity. In a commfsunity where credit Is
so much used, fluctuationsof values and vicissitudes
in business are largely caused by temporary beliefs
of men, even before those beliefs can conform to asÂ­
certained realities.

NECESSARY CURRENCY.
The amount of necessary currency at a given time
cannot be determined arbitrarily, and it should not
be assumed on conjecture that the amount is subÂ­
jected to both permanent and temporary changes.
An enlargement of it which seemed to be durable
happened at the beginning nf the civil war, by a
subatituted use of currency in the place of IndividÂ­
ual credits. It varies with certain states of busl.
ness; it fluctuates with considerable :regularity at
different seasons of the year-in autumn, for inÂ­
stance, when buyers of grain and other agricalÂ­
tural products begin their operations they usually
need to borrow capital or circulating credits by
which to make their purchases, and want these
funds in currency capable of being distributed in
smell sums among numerous sellers. Ihe addiÂ­
tional need of currency at such times is five per
cent, of the whole volume, and if a surplus beyond
what is required for ordinary use does not happen
to be oh hand at the moitey centers a scarcity of
currency ensues and also a stringency in the loan
market.
THE WANTS OF BUSINESS.
It was In reference to such expenses that in a disÂ­
cussion of this tbject in my annual message to the
New York legislature of January 5,.1875, a suggesÂ­
tion was mate that the federal government is bound
to redeem every portion of its issue which the public
de not wish to use. Having assumed to monopolize
the supply of currency, and enacted exclusions
against everybody else, it is bound to furnish all
which the wants of bosiness require. The system
should passively allow the volume of circulating
credits to ebb and flow according to the ever chang
lug wants of business. It should imitate as -losely
as possible the natural laws of trade, which it has
superseded by artifcial contrivances. In a similar
dtiscnosion in my message of January 4, 187m;, it was
said that resumrption should te effcctsd by sucb
measures so would keep the aggregate amount of
currency self-adjusting during all the process withÂ­
out creating, at any time an artificial scarcity,
without exciting the public imagination with
alarms which impair conndence and distract ltroely
the whole machinery of credit and disturb the natÂ­
ural operations of business.
RESERVES AND REDEMPTIONS.
Publicoeconomiea, official retrenchments and a
wise finance are the means which the St. Louis
convention indicatee as the provision for reserves
and redemptions. The best resource is a reduction
in expenses of the government below its income, for
that imposes no new charge on the people. If, hoya
ever, the improvidence and waste which have conÂ­
ducted us to a period of falling revenues oblige nato
supplement the results of economics and retrenchÂ­
ments by some resort to loans, we should not hesiÂ­
tate. The government ought not to speculate on
its own dishonor in order to save the interest of its
broken premises, which it still compells private
dealers to accept at a fictitious par. The bigbest
national holosr is not only right but would prove
profitable.
REDUCTION OF INTEREST.
Of the public debt nine hundred and eighty-five
million dollarshear interestat six per cent. ingold,
and sixty-five millions at five per cent. in gold; the
average interest is 5.58 per cent. A financial policy
that should secure the highest credit, wisely availed
of, ought gradually to obtain a reduction of one per
cent. in the interest on most of the loans. A saving
of one per cent. on the average would be seventeen
million dollais a year is-cold. That saving, reguÂ­
larly inveeted at four and a half per cent.. would,
in leastian thirty-eight years, cxtinguish the prinÂ­
cipal. The whole seventeen hundred millions o~f
the funded debt might be paid by this saving alone,
without cost to the people.
THE TIME FOR RESUMPTION.
The proper time for resumption is the time when
wise preparation shall have reigned into perfect
ability to accomplish the object with certainty and
ease, that will inspire confidence and encourage a
revival of business. The earliest time in which
such a result can be brought about is best. Eve n
when preparations shall have been matured, the
exact date would have to be chosen with reference
to the then existing state of trace, and the creditÂ­
cheet of operations in our country, the course of
foreign commerce, and the condition of our exÂ­
changes, with other nations.

SPECIFIC MEASURES.
The specific measures and actual dat are mattesr
of detail, having reference to the ever-changing
conditions. They belong to the domain of practical
administrative tsttemauship. The captain of a
Pteamerabout to sail from New York to t.iverpool
does not assemble a counsel over his ocean chart
and fix an angle by which to lash th' rudder fora
whole voyage. Human intelligence munst be at the
helm to discern the shifting forces of the waters
and winds; a human band must be at the helm to
feel the elements day by sa., and guide to a masteÂ­
ry. Over them such preparations are everything;
without them a legislative command fixing a dayÂ­
an omcial promise fixing a day-are shams. They
are worse-they are a i'elusion and snare to all who
trust them. They destroy all confidence among
thoughtful men whose jndgment.will at least sway
public opinion. An attempt to act on such a comÂ­
mand-without preparation, would end In a new
suspension. It would be a fresh calamity, prolific
of confusion, distrust and distr, as.
RADICAL RESUMPTION.
The act of congress of Jela, 1875, provided thst on
and after the first of Janury. 1879, the secretary of
the treauery shall redeem in coin ths legal tender
notes of the United States on presentation at the
office of the 5,ssist mnt treasurer, in the city of New
Toik. It authorixes the secretary to prepare and
provide for such resumption of spetie payments by
the use of any susrplus revenues not otherwise apÂ­
propriated, sad by issuing, in his discretion 5clusaes
of honds. More than one and a half of the feur
years bave passed. Congiess and the presi Jnt
have continued ever since to unite in act which
have legislated out of existence every possible sourÂ­
plus applicable to this purplose. The coin in lhe
treasury claimed to belong to the g vernment had,
on the thirtisthof June, fallen to less than $45,e0o.Â­
Oils, against SOO,Oh9,0tl00 on the first of July, 1875, and
the avallabilitlof a part of that sum is said to be
questionable, THE REVENUES.
The revenues are foltingi faster than appropria.
tions and expenditures are reduced, leaving the
treasury with diminishing resources. The secretary
has doulbothrng under his power to issue Honds,
the legislative comand the official, promises fixÂ­
ing aday for resumption have been made, and there

hNcould lay his hands on in riotous living, would
bus all character for honesty and veracity. lils
offer of anew trornise, or his profession actotnhe
value of the old promise, would alike provoke deÂ­
rision.
THlE PLATFORM ON RESUMPTION.
The St. Louis platform denounces the failnre for
eleven years to make good the promise of legalÂ­
tender notes; it denounces the omission to accsmuÂ­
bare any reserve for their redemption; it denounces
the conduct which, during eleven years of peace,
heamade no advance toward resumption, no prepa.

PREPARATION.
The St. Louis convention concludes its expresÂ­
sions in regard to the currency by a declaration of
its convictions as the praotical results of the eyeÂ­
teni of preparation which it damands. It saym:
""We believe such a systeum, w-all devised, aiid, above
all. instrusted to comp-)tent hands for execution,
creating at no time an attificiat scarcity of currenÂ­
cy, and at no time alarming the public mind to the

of its adoption will b ring heating on ite wing to all
our harrassed industries, set in motion thew weels

store employment to labor, and renew in all its
equal resources the prosperity of the people.

ion, caii advance to a resumption of specie paymntseit

istrationt of the executive ollice, I ehosld deem it a
duty so to exercise the. bowers with which it has
been or may be invested by congress as best and
soonest to conduct tha country to that beneficent
result.
CIVIL SERVICE.
The convention justly affirms that reform Is neceeÂ­
oary in the civil service, necessary for its pmirificaÂ­
tiosi, ito economy aiid elliciency ; neceossary in order
that the ordiiiary emiploymsent of public busniiese
mar not tie a prize lii fight for at the ballot-box-a
reliel of party zeal, instead of poole of Honor assigned
for proved comipetency, and held for fidelity in the

""odges, sdhnatirs, representatives, cabinet officers,

his: service exists mnot for this bussiness and benseit of
thie whole peoiple, but for the interest; of the office
holders, wiso are in truths hut servants of the
people.

THE GREEDY OFFICE-HOLDERS.
Under the influence of this pernicious error public
employments have been multiplied; the numbers of
those grathered into the ranks of office-holders have
been steadily increased beyond any posoible requireÂ­
ment of public business, while inefficiency, peculaÂ­
tion, frond and tnalveroation of public funds from
the highest places of power to the lowest have overÂ­
spread the whole service like a leprosy; the other
evil is the organization of official class into a body
of political mercenaries governing caucuses and
dictating nominations of their own party and atÂ­
tempting to carry elections of the people by undue
influence and by immense corruption. Funds sysÂ­
tenmatically collected from the salaries of foes of
otticeholders, the official class in other countries
sometimes by its own weight and sometimes in alliÂ­
ance with the army, has been able to rule unorganÂ­
ized masses even under universal suffrage. Here it
has already grown into a gigantic power capable of
stitling the inspirations of a sound public opinion
and of resisting an easy change of alministration
until misgoverinment becoiesintolAtable and pubÂ­
lic spirit has been stung to the pitch of a strong
revolution.
THE ROAD TC REFORM.
The first step in reform is theelevation of the standÂ­
ard by which the appointing power selects agents
to execiute official trsists. Next an importance is a
conscientious fidelity in the exercise of authority to
hold to account and displace untrustworthy and inÂ­
capable subordinates. The public interest, in an
honest and skilful performance of official trust,
must not be sacrificed to the use of incumbents. AfÂ­
ter these immediate steps, which will insure the exÂ­
hibition of better examples, we may wisely go oi to
the abolishing of unnecessary effices, and finally to
the patient, careful organization of a better civilÂ­
service system, under tests wherever practicable, of
proved competenicy suit fidelity. White ns ich may
be acconmplished by these methods, it. might encourÂ­
age delusive expectations if I withheld here the exÂ­
pression of my conviction that no reform of the civil
service ins this country will bie complete and permit.

by candidates or incumbents. Through this solÂ­
estnity only cas lie hbe effectually delivered from his
greatest temptation-to misuse the power and patÂ­
ronage with which the executive is necessarily

Educated in the belief that it is the first duty of a
citizen of this republic to take his fair allottuent of
care and trouble in public affairs, I have, for fifty
years, as a private citizen, fulfilled that duty.
Though occupied in an unusual degree during all
that period with the concerns of government. I have
never acquired the habit of official life. When, a
year and a half ago, I entered upon my present trust,
it was in order to cotnsnmmate the reforms to which
I had aIready devoted several of the best years of my
life. Knowing as I do, therefore. from fresh experiÂ­
ence, how great the difference is between gliding
through asi osficial routine and workint out a reform
of syste-ns and policies, it is impossible for me to
contemplate what needs to he done in federal adÂ­
muinistrations without an anxious sense of the diffiÂ­
culties of the undertaking. If summoned by the
suffrages of my countrymen to attempt this work, I
shall endeavor, with God's help, to be an efficient
instrumetnt of their will.

IHNDRICK'S LETTER.
The following is the full text of Gov. Hendrick's
letter of acceptance:
INDIANAPOLI, July 21, 1876.
GENTLEaMEN-I have the honor to acknowledge the
receipt of your communication, in which you have
formally notified me of my nomination by the naÂ­
tional democratic committee at St Louis as their
candidate for the office of vice-president of the
United States. It is a nomination which I had
neither expected nor desired, and yet I recognize
and appreciate the high honor done me by the conÂ­
vention. The choice of such a body, and pronounced
with such unusual unanimity, and accompanied
with so generous an expression of esteem and conf.
dence, ought to outweigh all merely personal desires
and preferences of my own. It is with this feeling,
and I trust also from a deep sense of public duty,
that I now accept the nomination and shall abide
the judgment of my countrymen.
THE 1'LATFOM ENDORSED.
It would have been impossible for me to accept the
nomination if I could not heartily indorse the plat
form of the convention. I am gratified, therefore,
to be able, unequivocally, to declare that I agree in
the priniciples, approve the policies, and sympathize
with the purposes enunciated in that platform. The
institutions of our country have been solely tried by
the exigencies of civil war, and since the peace b1- a
selfish and corrupt mansagement of puibl ic affairs,
wshich has shamed at before civilized mankind, by
unwise anid partial legislation, every industry and
interest of the people have been made to suffer, and
in the executive department of the government, disÂ­
honesty, rapacity-anl venality have debauched the
p ublic service. Men knewn to be unworthy lhave
beenupromeotecit whilst others have be en degradled for
fidelity to official duty. Public office has been made
the means of private profit, and the county has been
offeitded to see a class of mnte who boast of thes friend.
ship of the sworn protectors of the state, amassing
fortunes by defrauding the public treasury and by
corrupting the servants of the people in such a crisis
of the history of the country.
REFORM.
I rejoice that the convention at St. Louis has so
nobly.raisea the standard of reform. Nothing can
be well with us or with our affairs until the public
conscence-. shocked by the enormous evils sod
abuses which prevail, shall have been demanded and
conmpelled an unsparing reformation of our national
adminnistration. in its-head and in its members. In
such a reformation, the removal of a single officer,
even the president, is comparatively a trifling matÂ­
ter. if the system which he represents, and which
has fostered him as he has fostered it, is suffered to
remain. The president alone must not be made the
scapegoat for the enormities of the system which inÂ­
fects the public service, and the means of destrucÂ­
tion of our institutions. In some respects, I hold
that the present executive has been thie victim rathÂ­
er than the author of that vicious system. CongiesÂ­
aional and party leaders have been stronger than the
president. No one man could have created it, and
the removal of no one man can amend it. It is
thoroughly corrupt, and must be swept remorselessÂ­
ly away by the selection of a government composed
of elements entirely new and pledged to radical reÂ­
form. The first work of reform must evidently le
the restoration of the nermal operatiot of the con- I
stittetioti if the Uiiitedt States, with all its ameuidÂ­
ments. The necessities of war cannot be pleaded in
a time of peace. The right of local self-government,
as guaranteed by the constitution. must he everyÂ­
where restored, and the centralized, almost personal
imperialisni, which has been practiced, must be
d en away, or the first principles of the republic will
be lost.
FINAJCES.
Our financial system of expedients must te reform.

can be reached, in harmony with the interests of the
people, by artificial measures for the contraction of
the currency any more thaqtI believe that wealth or
ptosperity can be created by an inflation of currenÂ­
cy. The laws of finance cannot be disregarded. The
financial policy of the government, if, indeed, it deÂ­
serves the name of policy at all, has been in lisreÂ­
g and ot those lawn and reform. anud hita disturbed
siness confidence, as well as hindered a return to
specie payment. REÂ­
One feature of that policy was the resumption
clause of the act of 1875, which has embarrassed the
country by the anticipation of a compiulsory resumpÂ­
tion, for which no preparation has bteen mode, and
without any assurance that it would be prc-ticable.
The repeal of that clause is necessary, that the nat.
ural operationef financial laws may be restored*
that the business of the country may be relieve
from its disturbing and depressing influence, and
that a return to specie papments may be facilitated
by the substitution of wiser and more prudent legisÂ­
lation, and which shall mainly rely on a judicious
system of publiceconomy and officiat retrenchments
anil. aovTe all, in the promotion of prosperity in all
the industries of the people.
SPECIE PAYMENTS.
I do not understand the repeal of the resumption

clause of the act of 1875 to be a backward step in our
return to specie -synents, but the recovery of a
false step; and slttough the repeal may for a time
be prevented, yet the determination of the demoÂ­
cratic party on this subject has been formally deÂ­
clared. There should be no hindrances put in the
way of a return to specie payments. ""As such a
huindrance."" says the St. Louis platform. ""we dcÂ­
nlounce the resumption clause of the act of 1875, aniji
emaned Its repeal."" I thoroughly believe that by
joblic economy, byy official retrenchment antI by a
7ise finance, enabliing us to accumulatet},e precious
mtal s, resnuiption at an eeatly perIod is possible
without prodcing an artificial scarcity of currency

that these reforms, oiogetlier with the restoration of
pure governimenit, will restore general confidenice,
encourage useful investments if capital. furnish
enmploymtent to labor, antl relieve the cotuntry front

OUR INDUSTRIES.
With the Industries of the people there have been
frequent interfererces. Our patfocm truly says that
many industries have been impoveriohed to subsiÂ­
dizs a few. Our commerce has becn deranlgedt to an
inferior position on the high seas, manufacturess
have been diminished, agriculture has been embar-e

The burdens of the people must also he lightened

profligate exponditures which increasl. taxation

lars in 1870, tells its own story of oinr need of fiscal
reform. Our treaties with foreign powers shouild

citizens of foreign birth in any particular less secure

The engag,-ment took place inside the
harbor of Cardenas. The gunboat ""WilÂ­
mington."" the torpedo boat ''Winslow""
and the gunboat ""Hudson'' were the
only vesseis engaged. They entered
the harbor for the purpose of attackÂ­
ing some Spanish gunboats which were I
known to be there. These latter, howÂ­
ever, were not discovered by the ArnerÂ­
l-an force until the Spaniards opened
fire. The land batteries of the ('ardeÂ­
nas supported the fire of the Spanish
gunboats. The engagement commenced
at 2:05 p. mn. and lasted about an hour.
The vessels blockading Cardenas
were the gunboat ""Machias,"" the torÂ­
pedo boats ""Foote"" and ""''Winslo""w' and
the revenue cutter ""''Hudson.""

TER'IT FIC: FIGHT.
The battle. while it lasted, was teriÂ­
fic. The ""Wilmingtonn"" and the ""HudÂ­
son"" were ahead and opened fire on the
Spanish boats, hich were lying at the
dock. The firing began at a range of
about I500 yards. A few minutes later
the ""'Winslow ciame
up and also
opened fire. In an instant the entire
atrtention of the Slpanish gunboats and
land batteries was directed upon her.
From all sides shot and snell poured
in on the little torpedo boat. The ""WilÂ­
mington"" aniid the ""Hudson"" still kept
up their fire, but they could not turn
aside the lerrible storm of fire and
death pourting in upon the torpedo
boat.
The crew of the ""Winslnow,"" howeve'r,
never faitered for a second. At 2:35 a,


solid shot crashed into the hull of the
""Winslow"" and knocked out her boiler.
on an instant she begal to roll and
rock heleplessl.. Then there was a moÂ­
ment of awful suspense. A fierce cheer
of triumph went up from the Spaniards
on the gunboats and in the batteries,
and again a storm of fire was opened
on the helpless boat.
The gunboat ""Hudson,"" which was
lying near by, started to the assistance
of the ""Winslow."" She ran alongside
the torpedo boat and tried to throw a
line to the imperiled crew. UTp to this
time, with the exception of the one
shot which disabled the boiler of the
""Winslow,"" the firing of the Spanish
gunboats had been wild, but as the
""Winslow"" lay rolling in the water
the range grew closer and shells began
to explode all about her. It was diffiÂ­
cult for the ""Hudsen"" to get near
enough to throw a line to the ""WinÂ­
slow's"" crew, so terrible was the fire
all about her. Finally, after about




 twenty minutes, tne ""Hudson"" ip -
proached near enough to throw a line.
KILLED BY A SHELL.
Ensign IBagiey and six men were
standing in a group, on the deck of the
""Winslow."" ""Heave her, heave her.""
shouted Bagley as he looked toward the
commande-r of the ""Hudson"" and called
for a line. ""Don't miss it,"" shouted an
officer from the ""Hudson."" and w\ith a
smile Bagl'ly called back. ""Let her
come. It's ge-tt'ing too hot here for c'mÂ­
fort."" The line v.as thrown and aboutjt
the same instant a shall burst in tlie
very ltidst of the group of en onll
board the ""Vi inslow.""
Bagley was instantly killed, and a
few others dropped about him. Half a
dozen more fell groaning on the bloodÂ­
stained deck. One of the men pitched
headlong over the side of the boat, but
his feet caught in the iron rail and he
was hauled back. Bagley's body was
stretched on the deck and his face coinÂ­
pletely torn away and the upper part
of his body shattered.
It was a terrible moment. The IfrÂ­
pedo boat, disabled and helpless, rolled
and swayed under the fury of the fire
of the Spanish gunboats. When the
shell burst in the group on board the
""Winslow"" another wild shout of triÂ­
umph went up from the Spanish boats
and batteries, and again a heavy fire
was opened on the t1rpedo boat.
Finally thn "".tidson'' succeerled in
getting a ine on board the Winslow,
and was towing her oulit of the deadiy
range when the line a1rted and again
hon, boats were at thel mercy of the
Sp' nish fire. At :::05 p. in. the ""HudÂ­
soil' managed to get another! line nol
the delk of the ""'Winslow.' but there
wVere only threle imen left iat that time
to make it fast. The line was finally
secured and the ""''Winslow""n was townred
up to Pedras island, iwhre she was anÂ­
choreri with her dead and woundedÂ­ on
her decks. Thore. some 1""ien from the
''Hudson"" weni on board the ""Xin

shortly afterward. At 9:153

and some of the woiindbd., steancid tfor

this morning.
LTEUT. BEP NADOTU'S STORY.
Lieut. Berradou. with the surgeon
bending over him. told the story of the
battle ton the representative of the,
Associated Press as calmly as if talking
,of the weather. He began:
""W' went under full speed to, attack
the ipanish hea.ts in the harhbor and
""y""n know the result. We went under
orders from the comm!ilnander of the
'Wil'mington.' Or bIoat is hadly rlamÂ­
ag re. but. she wiii be brought here for
repairs and 1 think she will he ready
for service aiain in two weeks.""'
Continuing the Lieutenant said: ""The
'Winslow' was the worst injulred and
had five of her men killed and I don't
know how la.ny injured. We were orÂ­
dered ,to atack the Spanish gunboats
at (Cardenas.""
stet'med in under full head and were
tired upon as soon as we w\ere ii ralige.
The Spanish boats were tied up at the
docks, and had a fair range on us. The
batteries on shore also opened fire and
1 think we received most of the fire.
1 don't know' whether any one was hurt t
on the 'W'ilmington' or the 'Hudson,'
but I think not.
""I ha.ve no fault to find with the
'Winslow's' crew. They acted nobly all
the way through. The inen who were
killed fell at the same time. We were
standing in a group and the aim of
the Spanish was perfect. A shell burst
in our laces.""
The dead and wounded hbrught here
b)y the ""Hudson"" were taken in small
boa.ts to the Government dcks. This
was the first new's of the engagement
to reach Key West. No tiint was lost
in ministering to the wounded. A
quick call was sent to the marine hosÂ­
pital and the ambulance came clatterÂ­
ing down to the dcock. The dead were
taken to an undertaker's and the
wounded conveyed to the hospital.
In the meantime the news had sprenad
and crowds gathered about the dock,
but there was no 'temonstratin. Tihe
success of the American ships in 'very
action thus far has been so :verwheimÂ­
ing that it was hard to ralize tlhat
death had at last come to s'n, of our
men.
Ensign Bngley was about 26 yea:rs cf
age, and wthile the fleet waas statitneid
here he was one of the miost polutilar
men in the service. The news of ii,:
death causedr a terrible shock to a!l
who knew him. It has always been
a
foregone conclusion that the torpendo
boat was among the first to fall. as the
work is most dangerous, but in spite
of this. when the fleet -was stationed


frequently made, all 1he young men of
the service were eager for torpedo-boat
duty.
The ""Hudson"" shows the effect of the
fight. Her smokestack is punctured
with bullet holes and her cabin and
decks are damaged and splintered.
COVERED WITH T'~HE FLAG.
The ""WVinslow's"" dead are now lyin:g
at an undertaking establishment. The,
were taken there in a rough l.lwag)1o
still covered by the Stars and Stripes.
The rude conveyance was followed
by
a large crowd and all day long the
doors of the shop have been surrounded
by a large gathering. Naval oflicers,
marines and sailors came there to lohk
upon the faces of their dead conrades.
Some of the bodies show fearful
wounds.
Ensign Bagley was literally ltorn to
pieces. His body will he embalmed and
shipped home.
Oiler Varves had his throat cut open




 by a sharp piece of the shell, which apÂ­
parently severed his windpipe as if
slashed with a razor.
Fireman Daniel had his left shoulder
ripped up and the right side of his head
torn open.
The body of Tuninell, the colored
cook. shows no wounds.
Fireman Meeks was hit in the groin.
No orders for the disposition of the
bodies have yet been issued.
BAGLFEY AT ANNAPOLIS.
Annapolis, Md.. May 12.-Ensign
0Worth Bagley was one of the best
known men who ever came out of the
naval academy. He was an able and
capable man. His local fame here was
chiefly in the athletic field, he being
the fullback of the academy eleven.
He played in the series of West Point
and Naval academy games.
3BURNED SPANISH GUNBOAT.
It is now known that the American
boats rnade furious ha.voc. wXith CarÂ­
denas harbor aond town. The captain
of the ""I-ud aon"" said: ""I know we deÂ­
siroyed a large part of their town near
the wharves, burned one of their gunÂ­
boats, a.n I think destroyed two other
torpedo destroyers. We were in a \vorÂ­
tex of shot, shell, smoke, etc., and
could not tell acdulrately, but we saw
one of their boats on fire and sinking
soon after the action began. Then a
large building near the wharf, I think
the barracks, took fire, and many other.'
buildings were soon burning.
""The Spanish had masked batteries
on all sides of us. As soon as we got
within range of their hatteiies, they
would move them. I think their guns
were field pieces. Our large boat could
not get into the harbor to help up on
account of the shalow water.""

M'KINLEV'S MESSAOE
Natleaal Fineness Discussed sad Nsthlngj Else
Referred to
WASHINGTON, March 15.â€”The presÂ­
ident today sent the following message
to congress:
NECESSITY DEPLORED.
Regretting the necessity which has reÂ­
quired me to call you together, I feel
that your assembling In extraordinary
session Is Indispensable because of the
condition In which we find the revenues
of the government. It Is conceded that
its current expenditures are greater
than lta receipts, and that such condiÂ­
tion has existed now more than three
years. With unlimited means at our
command we are presenting the remarkÂ­
able spectacle of Increasing the public
debt by borrowing money to meet the
ordinary outlaya Incident upon even the
economical and prudent administration
of the government
THE GOOD OLD TIMES.
An examination of the subjects disÂ­
closes this fact In every detail and leads
Inevitably to the conclusion that the
condition of the revenue which allows It
Is unjustifiable and should be corrected.
We find by the report of the secretary of
the treasury that the revenues of the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1892, from all
sources, were 1425,868,260.22, and expendÂ­
itures for all purposes were $415,953_,806.56
leaving an excess of receipts over expenÂ­
ditures of J9,914,543.66. During that fiscal
year $40,670,467.98 were paid upon the
public debt, which has been reduced
since March 1, 1889, 8259,076,890 and anÂ­
nual Interest charge decreased $11,684,Â­
--576.60. The receipts of the government
from all sources during the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1893, amounted to $416,Â­
--716,561.94, and its expenditures to $469,Â­
--874,887.66, showing an excess of receipts
over expenditures of $254,167.29.
WriEN TROUBLE BEGAN.
Since that time the receipts of no fiscal
year, and with but few exceptions, of no
month of any fiscal year have exceeded
the expenditures. The receipts of thr
government from all sources during the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1894, were
$872,892,488.29, and Its expenditures $442,Â­
--605,758.87, leaving a deficit, the first since
the resumption of specie payments, of
$69,983,230.58. Notwithstanding there
waa a decreaae of $16,769,128.78 In the orÂ­
dinary expenses of the government as
compared with the previous fiscal year,
lta income was still not sufficient to proÂ­
vide for Its dally necessities, and the
gold reserve Jn the treasury for the reÂ­
demption of greenbacks was drawn upon
to meet them.
BOND ISSUES
But this did not suffice and the govÂ­
ernment then resorted to loans to reÂ­
plenish the reserve. In February, 18*4,
$50,000,000 in bonda waa issued.and In NoÂ­
vember following a aecond issue ot $50,Â­
--000,000 was deemed necessary. The aum ot

ly decreased until on. February 8, 1895,
the third sale of $62,315,400 bonds ($66.Â­
--116,244) was announced to congress. The
reoelpts of the government's first fiscal
year, ending June 80, 1895, were $39,373,Â­
--208.80, and expenditures $433,178,426.48,
showing a deficit of $48,805,223.18. A furÂ­
ther loan of $100,000,000 was negotiated
by the government In February, 1896, the
sale netting $111,166,246 and swelling the
aggregate bonds Issued within three
years to $262,135,600.
For the fiscal year ending June 20,1896,
the revenues of the government from all
sources amounted to $409,475,408.78, while
its expenditures were $434,678,654.48, or
an excess of expenditures over receipts
of $26,208,245.70. In other words, the toÂ­
tal receipts of the three fiscal years endÂ­
ing June 30, 1896, were Insufficient by
$187,811,729.46 to meet the total expendiÂ­
tures, nor has this condition since ImÂ­
proved. For the first half of the present
fiscal year the receipts of the governÂ­
ment, exclusive of postal revenue, were
$167,607,603.76, and expenditures, excluÂ­
sive of postal services, $195,410,000.29, or
an excess of expenditures over receipts
of $35,902,396.46. In January this year
â– the receipts, exclusive of postal revenues,
were $24,316,994.29, a deficit of $5,962,397.24
for each month. In the treasury this
year the receipts, exclusive of postal
revenues, were $24,400,977.38, and exÂ­
penditures, exclusive of postal service,
$28,796,076.66, a deficit of $4,396,063.28, or
a total deficit of $186,031,580.44 for the
three years and eight months ending
March 1, 1897.
SURPLUS ALL GONE.
Not only are we without surplus in the
treasury, but with an increase In the
public debt there has been a correspondÂ­
ing Increase In the annual Interest
charge from $22,893,883.20 In 1892, the
lowest of any year since 1862, to $34,337,Â­
--297.60, in 1896, or an Increase of $11,493,Â­
--414.40. It may be urged that even If the
revenues of the government had been
sufficient to meet all Its ordinary exÂ­
penses during the past three years, the
gold seserve would still have been InÂ­
sufficient to meet the demands upon It.
and that bonds would necessarily have
been lasued for Its repletion. Be this as
11 may, It Is clearly manifest without
denying or affirming the correctness of
such a conclusion, that the debt would
have been decreased at least the amount
deficient and business confidence ImÂ­
measurably strengthened throughout
the country.
CORRECTION NEEDED.
Congress should promptly correct exÂ­
isting conditions. Ample revenues must
be supplied not only for ordinary exÂ­
penses of the government, but for the
prompt payment of liberal pensions and
the liquidation of the principal ana inÂ­
terest of the pubHc debt. In raising
revenues the duties should be so levied
upon foreign products as to preserve the
home market so far as possible to our
producers, revive and Increase our manÂ­
ufactures; to relieve and encourage our
agricultural Industries; to Increase our
domestic and foreign commerce; to aid
and develop mining and building, and
to render to labor In every field of useful
ocoupatlon liberal wages and adequate
rewards to which skill and industry are
Justly entitled. The necessity of passÂ­
ing a tariff law which shall provide amÂ­
ple revenue ne*d no* be further
urged. The Imperative demand of the
hour ts the prompt enaotment of such
a measure, and to this object I earnestly
recommend that congress shall make
every endeavor. Before other business
U transacted let us first provide sufficient
revenue to faithfully administer tha
government without contracting further
debt or continued dlaturbance of our
finances.

of the present treaties has been so enlarged
as to secure to the citizens of either country

has also been concluded. The war between

during its continuance suffered through the

'Will soon be negotiated.

j& THE CONGO COUNTRY.
Pursuant to the advice of the Senate at the
last session, I recognized the fiag of the InÂ­
ternational Association of the Congo as that
of a friendly Government, avoiding in so doÂ­
ing any prejudgment of conflict. In the terÂ­
ritorial claims m that region subsequently,
in execution of the expressed wish of ConÂ­
gress, I appointed a commercial agent for
the Congo basin. The importance of the rich
prospective trade of the Congo Valley has led
ton general conviction that it should be
. open to all nations upon equal terms. An
International Conference for the consideraÂ­
i..; tion of tins subject was called by the EmperÂ­
or of Germany, and is now in session at BerÂ­
lin. Delegates arc in attendance on behalf
of the United States. Of the results of the
conference, you will be duly advised.
IJSGATIOS PREMISES IN THE KAST.
The Government of Cospn has generously
aided the efforts of the United States MinisÂ­
ter to secure suitable premises for the use of
the legation. Assise conditions of the diploÂ­
matic Intercourse with the EastÂ­
ern nations tlem:.. ! Jl the legation
premises t be ow-tl by the repre-
: sented power, I ndv .- that an appropriation
be made for the acqr'sition of this property
by the Government. The United states alÂ­
ready possesses valuable premises at TanÂ­
Riers as a gift from the Sultan of Morocco. As
is stated hereafter, they have lately received
a similar gift from the Siamese Government.
The Government of Japan stands ready to
sell to as extensive grounds at Tokto where- i
In to erect a suitable bo tiding for the lega- '
tion, Court-house and Jail ; and similar privÂ­
ileges can probably be secured In China and

Persia. The owning of such premises would
: not only - affect a large saving of present
rentals, ont would permit of the due asser- j
tion of extra territorial rights in these counÂ­
tries, and wor'd the better serve to maintain
the dignity of tne United States. . ,
The failure of Congress to make an approÂ­
priation for our representative at the AutonÂ­
omous Court of - the Khedive has proved a
serious embarrassment in our intercourse
' with Egypt; and in view of the necessary in-
tlmacy of the diplomatic relationship due to
; the participation of this Government as one
of the treaty powers in all matters of adminÂ­
istration there affecting the rights of forÂ­
eigners. I advise the restoration of the agency
and Consul-General at Cairo on its former
basis 1 do not conceive it to be the wish of
Congress that the United States should withÂ­
draw altogether from the honorable position
.thcy have hitherto held with renpect to the
Khedive, or that citizens of this Kepublic reÂ­
siding or sojourning in Egypt should hereafÂ­
ter be without the aid and protection of a
competent representative.

awaits the necessary tariff legislation of ConÂ­
gress to become effective. This legislation
will, I doubt not, be among the first measÂ­
ures to claim your attention. A full treaty
of commerce, navigation and consular rights
Is much to fee desired, and such a treaty, I
have reason to believe, the Mexican GovernÂ­
ment stands ready to conclude. Some emÂ­
barrassment has been occasioned by the failÂ­
ure of Congress at Its last session to provide
means for the doe execution of the treaty of
July 29, 18S2, for the resurvey of the Mexican
boundary and the relocation of the bounÂ­
dary monuments.
NICARAGUA. :-'.,
With the Eepnblie of Nicaragua a treaty
has been concluded which authorizes the
construction by the United States of a canal,
railway and telegraph line across the NlcaraÂ­
guan territory. By the terms of the treaty sixÂ­
ty miles of the River San Juan,as well as Lake
Nicaragua, ;- an Inland sea forty miles
in width, are to constitute a part
of the, projected enterprise. This
covers for actual canal construction sevenÂ­
teen miles on the Pacific side and thirty-six
miles on the Atlantic To the United States,
whose rich territory on the Pacific is, for the
ordinary purposes of commerce, practically
cut off from communication by water with
the Atlantic ports, the political and commerÂ­
cial advantages of such a project can scarceÂ­
ly . be over-estimated. It is believed that
when the treaty is laid before you, the jusÂ­
tice and liberality of its provisions will comÂ­
mand universal approval at home and
abroad. , ,

pitality which onr territory affords. The ofÂ­
ficers of the Government have been instructed
to exercise vigilance to prevent infractions
of our neutrality laws at Key West and at
other points near the Cuban coast. I am
happy to say that in the only Instance when
these precautionary measures were successÂ­
fully eluded, the offenders when found in
our territory were subsequently tried and
convicted. The growing need of close relaÂ­
tionship of intercourse and traffic between
the Spanish Antilles and their natural marÂ­
ket in tho United States, led to tue adoption,
in January last, of a commercial agreement
looking to that end. This agreement has
since been superceded by a more carefully
framed and comprehensive 'convention
which I shall submit to the Senate for apÂ­
proval. It has been the aim of this negotiaÂ­
tion to open such a favored reciprocal
exchange of productions carried unÂ­
der the fiag of either country as
to make the -intercourse between Cuba and
Porto Kieo and ourselves scarcely less IntiÂ­
mate than the commercial movement' ' beÂ­
tween our domestic ports, and to insure a reÂ­
moval of the burdens on shipping in the
Spanish Indies, of which in the past our ship
owners and ship masters have so often bad
eanse to complain. The negotiation of this
convention has for a time postponed the
prosecution of certain claims of our citizens
which were declared to be without the jurisÂ­
diction of the late Spanish-American Claims
Commission, and which we therefore remitÂ­
ted to diplomatic channels for adjustment.
The speedy settlement of these claims will
now be urged by the Government.

result will shortly be laid before the Senate
' TURKEY.
' Certain questions between the United
States and t he Ottoman Empire still remain
unsolved. Complaints in benalf 1 of our citiÂ­
zens are not satisfactorily adjusted. The
Porte has sought to withhold from our comÂ­
merce the right of favored treatment to
which we are entitled by the existing conÂ­
ventional stipulations and the revision of the
tariffs is unaccomplished.
VENEZUELA.
The final disposition of the pending quesÂ­
tions with Venezuela has not as yet been
reached, but I have good reason to expect an
early settlement, which will provide the
means of re-examining the Caracas awards
In conformity with the expressed desire of
Congress, and which will recognize the jusÂ­
tice of certain claims preferred against VeneÂ­
zuela.THE CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICAN COMMISÂ­
SIONappointed by authority of the act of July 7,
lstfi, will soon proceed to Mexico. It has
been furnished with instructions which will
be laid before yon. They contain a statement
of the general policy of the Government for
enlargin.1; commercial intercourse with
American States. The Commissioners have
been actively preparing for their responsible
task by holding conferences in the principal
cities with merchants and others interested
In Central and South American trade.
THE INTERNATIONAL MERIDIAN CONFERENCE
lately convened In Washington upon the inÂ­
vitation of the Government of the United
States was composed of representatives
from twenty-five nations. The conference
concluded its labors on the 1st of November,
having with snbstantial unanimity agreed
upon the meridian of Greenwich as the startÂ­
ing point whence longitude is to be computÂ­
ed eastward and westward, and on the adopÂ­
tion for all purposes for which it may be
found convenient of a universal day which
Bhall begin at midnight on the initial meriÂ­
dian, and whose hours shall be counted from
zero up to. twenty-four. The formal report
of the transactions of this conference will be
hereafter transmitted to Congress.
FOREIGN EXHIBITIONS.
This Government is in frequent receipt of
invitations from foreign States to participate
in International exhibitions, often of great
Interest and importance. Occupying as we
do an advanced position on the world's proÂ­
duction and aiming to secure a profitable
share for our industries in the general comÂ­
petitive markets, it is a matter of serious
concern that the want of means for particiÂ­
pation in these exhibits should so often exÂ­
clude our producers from advantages enÂ­
Joyed by those of other countries during the
past year. The attention of Congress was
drawn to the formal invitations in this regard
tendered by the . Governments of England,
Holland, Belgium, Germany and Austria.
The Executive has in some Instances apÂ­
pointed honorary commissioners. This is,
however, a most unsatisfactory expedient,
for without some provision to meet the necÂ­
essary working expenses of a commission It
can effect little or nothing in behalf of exÂ­
hibitors. ' r t i f
AS INTERNATIONAL INVENTORS' EXHIBITION.
Is to be held In London next May. This
will cover a field of special importance
in which our country holds a foremost
rank, -bnt the , Executive is at present
powerless to organize a proper representaÂ­
tion of our vast national interests in this
direction. I have in several previous mesÂ­
sages referred to this subject. It seems to
me that a statute giving to the Executive
general discretionary authority to accept
such Invitations and to appoint honorary,
commissioners without salary, and placing
at the disposal of the Secretary of State, a
email fund for defraying their reasonable
expenses, would be of great public utility. ;
COLLISIONS AT SEA. ; - s
This Government has received official
notice that the revised international reguÂ­
lations for preventing collisions at sea
have been adopted by ail the leading
maritime powers except the United States,
and came - into force on the 1st of SepÂ­
tember last. For the due protection of out
shipping interests, the provisions of our
statutes should at once be brought into conÂ­
formity with these regulations. t
INTERNATIONAL COPYRIGHT.
The question of securing to authors, comÂ­
posers and artists copyright privileges in this
country in return lor reciprocal rights
abroad justly challenges your attention. It
is true that a convention will be necessary
for fullv accomplishing this result. But unÂ­
til Congress shall by statute fix the extent to
-which foreign holders of copyright shall be
here privileged.it has been deemed inadvisaÂ­
ble - to negotiate such conventions. Kor
this reason the United Mates was not repreÂ­
sented at the recent conference at Berne.
NEUTRALITY LAWS.
I recommend that the scope of the neutralÂ­
ity laws of the United States be so enlarged
as to cover all patent acts of hostility, comÂ­
mitted In our territory and aimed against the
peace of a friendly nation. Existing statutes
prohibit the fitting out;of armed expeditions,
and restrict the shipment of explosives,
though the enactments in the latter respect
were not framed with regard to internaÂ­
tional obligations, but simply for the protecÂ­
tion of passenger travel. All these statutes
were intended to meet special emerÂ­
gencies that had already arisen. Other
emergencies have arisen since, and modern
ingenuity supplies means for the, OrganizaÂ­
tion of hostilities without open resort to
armed vessels or filibustering parties. I see
no reason why overt- preparations In this
country - for the commission of criminal
acts, such as are here under consideration,
should not be alike punishablewbetber such
acta are intended to be committed in onr
own country, or in a foreign country with
which we are at peace. The prompt and
thorough treatment of this question is one
which intimately, concerns the National
Honor. , - :

Onr existing naturalization laws also need
revision. Those sections relating to persons
residing within the limits of tb United

States In 1795 and 1798 have now only an Ms-'v
torical interest. Section 2712, recognizing
the citizenship of the children of naturalized
Jarents is ambiguous in its terms and partÂ­
y obsolete. There are special provisions ot
law favoring the naturalization of those who
serve in the army or in merchant vessels,whlle
no similar privileges are granted those who
serve in the navy' or marine corps. ""An
uniform rule of naturalization, such
as the Constitution contemplates,
should, among other things, clearly
define the status of persons born within the
UnRed States, subject to a foreign power.""
Section 19Stt: ""And of minor children of
fathers who have declared their Intention of
becoming citizens, but failed to perfect their
naturalization."" It might be wise to provide
for a central bureau of registry, wherein
should be filed authenticated transcripts of
every record of naturalization in the several
Federal and State Courts and to make proÂ­
vision also for the vacation or cancellation
of such record In cases where fraud had been
Sracticed upon the court by the applicant
imself, or where he had removed or forfeitÂ­
ed his acquired citizenship. A just and uniÂ­
form law in this respect would strengthen
the bands of the Government in protecting
its citizens abroad, and would pave the way
Utr the conclusions of treaties ot naturalizaÂ­
tion with foreign countries.
DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR SERVICE, .i -
' The legislation of the last session effected
In the diplomatic and consular service cerÂ­
tain changes and reductions which have been
productive of embarrassment. The populaÂ­
tion and intermediate activity of our counÂ­
try are steadily on the increase and are giv.
ing rise to ever varying and often delicate
relationships with other countries. Our
foreign establishment now embraces
nearly double the area of operations
that it did twenty - years ago. The
confinement of such a service within the limÂ­
its of expenditure then established is not, it
seems to me, In accordance with true econÂ­
omy. A community of 60,000,000 of people
should be adequately represented In its inÂ­
tercourse with foreign nations. , A project for
the reorganization of consular service and
for recasting the scheme of extra territorial
jurisdiction Is now before yon. If the limits
of a short session will not allow its full conÂ­
sideration, I trust you will not fail to make
suitable provision for the present needs of
the service It has been customary to define
in the appropriation acts the rank of each
diplomatic office to which ' a salary is atÂ­
tached. I suggest that this course be abanÂ­
doned, and that it be left to the President,
with the- advice and consent of the Seaate,
to fix from time to time the diplomatic grade
of the representatives of this , Government
abroad as may seem advisable, provision
being definitely made, however, as now, for
the amount of salary attached to the reÂ­
spective stations.
FINANCIAL.
The condition of our finances and the opÂ­
eration of the various branches of the public
services which are connected with the TreasÂ­
ury Department are very fully discussed in
the report of the Secretary. It appears that
the ordinary revenues for the fiscal year endÂ­
ed June 30, 1884, were:
From customs. $195,067,489 '78
From Internal revenues lil,586,07i 51
From all other sources 31,866,307 65
Total ordinary revenue $348,519,8fi!) 91
The public expenses during the same period
were: ;
For civil expenses $22,312,007 71
For foreign intercourse 1,260,766 37
For Indians v 6,475,999 29
For pensions 85,429,228 36
For the military establishment, Qj
including river and harbor imÂ­
provements and arsenals 39,429,603 36
For the naval establishments inÂ­
cluding vessels, machinery and
improvements at navy yards.. 17,292,601 44
For miscellaneous expenditures
including . public buildings,
light houses, and collecting the
revenue 4n,939,710 00
For expenditures on account of
the District of Columbia 407,049 26
For interest on the public debt.. 54,578,378 48
For the sinking fund 46,790,229 50
Total ordinary expenditures ?290,916,4$3 83
Leaving a surplus of $57,603 396.09. As comÂ­
pared with the preceding fiscal year there
was a net decrease of over $21,000,000 in the
amount of expenditures. The aggregate reÂ­
ceipts were less than those of the year
previous by about $54,000,000. The falling off
of revenue from customs made up nearly
$20,000,000 of this deficiency, and about $23,Â­
000,000 of the remainder was due to the dimÂ­
inished receipts from internal taxation.
The Secretary estimates the total receipts
for the fiscal year which will end June 3oth,
1885, at $.00,000,000, and the total expenditures
at $290,620,201.16, In which are included the inÂ­
terest on the debt and the amount payable
to the sinking fund. This would leave a
surplus for the entire year of about $39,000,Â­
000. The value of exports from the United
States to foreign countries during the year
ending June 30th, 1881, was as follows:
Domestic merchandise $724,764,852
Foreign merchandise 15,518,757

Total merchandise..
Specie....
.$740,513,609
.$ 67,133,383
Total exports of merchandise and
specie $S07,6i6,992
The cotton and cotton manufactures inÂ­
cnlded In this statement were valued at $208,Â­
900,415, the breadstuff s at $102,544,715, the proviÂ­
sions at $114,416,547 and the mineral oil at
$47,103,24S.
During the same poriod the imports were
as follows:
Merchandise $667,097,693
Gold and silver 37,426,262
Total $705,123,:55
More than 63 per cent, of the entire value
of imported merchandise consisted of the
following articles:
Sugar and Molasses $103,8S4,274
Wool and Woolen manufactures.... 5:5,542,292
Silk and its manufactures... 49,949,128
Coffee 49,686,705
Iron and Steel and manufactures
thereof 41,464,599
Chemicals 38,464,965
Flax, Hemp, Jute and like subÂ­
stances and manufactures thereof 33,463,399
Cotton and manufactures of cotton 30,454,476
Hides and. Skins other than Fur
Skins... 22,350,306
SILVER DOLLARS AND CERTIFICATES.
I concur with the Secretary of the TreasÂ­
ury In recommending the immediate suspenÂ­
sion of the coinage of silver dollars and of
the issuance of silver certificates. This is a
matter to which in former communications I
have more than once invoked the attention of
the National Legislature. It appears that
annually for the past six years there have
been coined Incompliance with the requireÂ­
ments of the act of February 2Sth, 1878, more
than twenty-seven million silver dollars. The
number now outstanding is reported by tho
Secretary to be nearly 185,000,000, whereof
but little more than 40,000,000, or less than
twenty-two per cent., are in actual circulaÂ­
tion. The mere existence of this fact seems
to me to furnish of itself a cogent arguÂ­
ment for the repeal of the statute which
has made such fact possible, but there
are other and graver considerations that
tend in the same direction. The Secretary
avows his conviction that, unless this coinÂ­
age and issuance of silver certificates be
suspended, silver Is likely at no disÂ­
tant day to become our - sole metallic
Btandard. The commercial disturbance
and the impairment of National credit that
would be thus occasioned can scarcely be
overestimated. I hope that the Secretary's
suggestions respecting the withdrawal from
circulation of the $1 and $2 notes will receive
your approval.: It is likely that a consideraÂ­
ble port-ion of the silver now in t-iie vaults of
the Treasury might find its way into curÂ­
rency. . i ; -t,; ,
' t ;: TRADE DOLLARS. T
fWblle trade dollars have ceased, for the
present at least, to be an element of active
disturbance In our currency . system, some
provision should be made for their surrender
to the Government. In view of the circumÂ­
stances under which they were coined and
of the fact that they have never had a legal
tender quality, there should be offered for
them only a slight advance over their bullion
value. The Secretary, in the course of his
report, considers the propriety of beautifyÂ­
ing the designs of our subsidiary silver coins,
and of so increasing their weight that they
may bear their, due-ratio of value to the
standard dollar, ' His conclusions in this reÂ­
gard are cordially approved.
EXCIStt taxes. ,
In my annual message of -1882 I recomÂ­
mended the abolition of all excise taxes exÂ­
cept those relating to distilled spirits. This
recommendation is now renewed. In case
these taxes shall be abolished the revenues
that will still remain to the Government
will, In my opinion, not only suffice to meet
Its reasonable expenditures, but will afford a
surplus large enongh to permit such tariff
reduction as may seem to be advisable when
the results of the recent revenue laws and
commercial treaties shall have shown in
what quarters these reductions can be most
Judiciously effected. . :
i, FOREIGN TRADE.
One of the gravest of the problems which
appeal to the wisdom of Congress for soluÂ­
tion is the ascertainment of the most effecÂ­
tive means of Increasing our foreign trade,
and thus relieving the depression under
which our industries are now languishing.
The Secretary of the Treasury advises that
the duty of Investigating this subject be inÂ­
trusted in the first Instance to a competent
commission. While fully recognizing the
considerations that may be urged against
this course, lam nevertheless of the opinion
that upon the whole no other would be likely
to effect speedier or better results.
SHIPPING INTERESTS.
; -That 'portion of the Secretary's report
which concerns the condition of -our shipÂ­
ping interests can not fail to command your
attention. He emphatically recommends
that as an Incentive to the -Investment of
American capital in American steamships,
the Government shall, by liberal payments
for mail transportation or otherwise, lend its
active assistance to individual enterprise,
and declares bis belief that unless that course
be pursued onr foreign-carrying trade must
remain as It is to-day, almost exclusively in
the hands of foreigners. One phase of this
subject is now especially prominent, In view
of the repeal, by the act of June 98, 1884, ot
all the saltatory provisions arbitrarily comÂ­
pelling American veaeto to carry tne mails

to and from the United States."" As tt 1 nee-

essarv to make orovision to comDensate the
owner of sncb vessels for performing that
servico alter April, ii, n is nopea tnas uo
whole subiect will receive early considera
tion that will lead to the enactment of such
measures for the revival of onr merchant
marine as the wisdom of Congress may de
vise.
CTUCULATIOIT Or NATIONAL BANES. '
The three ner cent, bonds of the Govern
ment to the amount of more than $100,000,000
have, since my last annual message, been reÂ­
deemed by the Treasury. The bonds of that
issue still outstanding amount to little over
S20O.00O.OOd. about one-fourth of which will be
retired through the operations of the sinking
fund during the coming year. . As these
bonds still continue the chief basis for the
circulation of the National Banks, the quesÂ­
tion how to avert the contraction of the curÂ­
rency caused by their retirement is one of
constantly increasing importance.
It seems to be generally conceded that the
law governing this matter exacts from the
banks excessive security and that upon their
present bond deposits a larger circulation
than Is now allowed may be granted with
safety. I hope that the bill which passed the
Senate at the last session, permitting the
issue ot notes equal to the face value of deÂ­
posited bonds, will commend Itself to the
approval of the House of Representatives.
THE WAR DEPARTM'ENT.
In the expense of the War Department the
Secretary reports a decrease of more than
$9,000,000, of which reduction $5,600,000 was efÂ­
fected in the expenditures for rivers and harÂ­
bors aad S2.700.O0O in exDenditures for the
Quartermaster's Department. Outside of
that denartment the annual expenses of all
the army bureaus proper (except possibly
the ordnace bureau), are substantially
charges which can not be materially diminÂ­
ished without chansre in the numerical
strength of the army. The expenditures in
the Quartermaster's Department can readily
be subjected to administrative discretion,
and it is reported by the Secretray of War
that as a result of exercising such discretion
In reducing the number of draught animals
in the army the annual cost of supplying and
caring for such animals is now $1,108,0850
less than it was in 1882.
The renorts of the military commander
show that the last year has been notable for
its entire ireedom irom inuiau ouioreaKs.
THE INDIAN TERRITORY RAIDERS.
In defiance of the President's proclamation
of July 1, 1884, certain intruders sought to
make settlements in tne xnuian xerniory.
Thev were Tironmt.lv removed bv a detach
ment of troops. During tho past session of
Congress a bill to provide a suitable fireÂ­
proof building for the Armv Medical Museum
ana tne ilDrary or tne ssurgeon-iienerars
office received the approval of the Senate. A
similar bill reported favorably to the House
of Representatives bv one of its committees
is still pending before that body. It is hoped
that during the coming session the measure
may become a law, and immediate steps may
be taken to secure a place of safe deposit for
these valuable collections now in a state of
insecurity. ""The funds with which tne
works"" tor the imnrovement of rivers and
harbors were prosecuted duringthe past year
were uenvea irom tne appropriations oi ino
act of August 2, 1882, together with
such few balances as were on band
from previous appropriations. The balÂ­
ance In the Treasury subiect to requisition
July 1,1883, was $10,021,649.55; the amount
appropriated during tne nscai year was
$1,319,634,627, and the amount drawn from the
Treasury during the fiscal year was $8,228,Â­
703.64, leaving a balance of $3,112,580.63 in the
Treasury subject to requisition July 1st, 1884.
SEABOARD CITIES.
The Secretary of War submits the report
of the Chief of Engineers as to the practicaÂ­
bility of nrotectinir our important cities a
the seaboards by fortifications and other
aeienses aoie to repel mouern meinous or
attack. The time has now come when such
defenses can be prepared with confidence
that they will not prove abortive, and when
the possible result of delay in making such
preparation is seriously considered, delay
seems inexcusable. For the most important
cities, those whoss destruction or capture
would be a National humiliation, adequate
defenses, inclusive of guns, may be made by
the gradual expenditure of $60,000,000, a sum
much less than a victorious enemy could
levy as a contribution. An appropriation of
about one-tenth of that amount is asked to
begin the work, and 1 concur wito the SecreÂ­
tary of War In urging that it be granted.
GUNS.
The War Department is proceeding with
the conversion of ten-inch smooth-bore guns
Into eight-inch rifles by lining the former
with tubes of forged or of coiled wronglit
Iron. Fifty guns will be thus converted durÂ­
ing the year. This, however, does not obviÂ­
ate the necessity of providing means for the
construction of guns of 'the highest power,
botli for the purpose of coast defense and for
the armament of war vessels. The report of
the Gun Foundry Board, appointed April 2d,
1883, in pursuance of the act of March 8th,
lss, was transmitted to Congress in a special
message of February 8th, 1884. In my message
of March 26th, 1884, 1 called attention to the
recommendation of the board that the GovÂ­
ernment should encourage the production of
private steel works of the required material
for heavy cannon, and that two Government
factories, one for tiie Army and one for the
Kavy, should be established for the fabricaÂ­
tion of guns from such material. o action
having been taken, the Board was subseÂ­
quently reconvened to then determine more
fully the plans and estimates necessary
for carrying out its recommendations.
It has received Information which indicates
that there are responsible steel manufacturÂ­
ers in this country, who, although not proÂ­
vided at present with the necessary plant,
are willing to construct the same and to
make bids for contracts with the GovernÂ­
ment for the supply of the requisite material
for the heaviest guns adapted to modern
warfare, if a guaranteed order of sufficient
magnitude, accompanied by a positive apÂ­
propriation extending over a series of years,
shall be made by Congress. All doubts as to
the feasibility of the plan being thus reÂ­
moved, 1 renew my recommendation, that
such action be taken by Congress as will enÂ­
able the Government to construct Its own
ordnance upon its own territory, and so to
provide the armaments demanded by conÂ­
siderations of national safety and honor.
THE NAVY. .
The report of the Secretary of the Navy exÂ­
hibits the progress which has been made on
the new steel cruisers authorized by the acts
of August 5th, 1882, and March 3d, lo8i. Of the
four vessels under contract one, the Chicago,
of 4,500 tons, is more than half finished ; the
Atlanta, 3,000 tons, has been successfully
launched, and her machinery is now fitting;
the Boston, also of 3,000 tons, is ready for
launching, and the Dolphin, a dispatch
steamer of 1,500 tons Is ready for delivery.
Certain adverse criticisms upon the designs
of these cruisers are discussed by the SecÂ­
retary, who insists that the correctness
of the conclusions "" reached by the
Advisory Board and by the DeÂ­
partment has been demonstrated by
recent developments - in ship-building
abroad. The machinery of the doubleÂ­
turreted monitors, Puritan, Terror and
Amphitrite, contracted for under the
act of March 3d, 1883, is in process
of construction. No work has been done
during the past year on their armor, for lack
of the necessary appropriations. A fourth
monitor, the Monadnock. still remains unÂ­
finished at the navy yard in California. It is
recommended that early steps be taken to
complete these vessels, and to provide also
an armament for the monitor Miantonomah.
The recommendations of the Naval Advisory
Board, approved by the department, comÂ­
prise the construction of one steel cruiser of
4,500 tons, one cruiser of 3,000 tons, two heavÂ­
ily armed gunboats, one light cruising gunÂ­
boat, one dispatch vessel armed with HotchÂ­
kiss cannon, one armored ram and three torÂ­
pedo boats. The general designs, all of
which are calculated to meet the existing
wants of the service, are now well advanced
and the construction of the vessols can be
undertaken as soon as you shall grant the
necessary authority. , .. .
THE JEANNETTE VICTIMS.
The act of Congress approved August 7,
1382, authorized the removal to the United
States of the bodies ofUeutenant-Com-mander
George W. DeLong and his comÂ­
panions of the Jeannette expedition.' This
removal has been successfully accomÂ­
plished by Lieutenants Harberand Schuetze.
The remains were taken from their grave
in the Lena Delta in March, 1883, and were reÂ­
tained at Yakutsk until the following winter,
the season being too lar advanced to admit
of their immediate transportation. They arÂ­
rived at New York February 20, 1884, where
they were received with situabie honors.
THE OREELY RELIEF EXPEDITION.
In pursuance of the Joint resolution of
Congress, approved February 13,1884, a naval
exDedition was fitted out tor the relief of 1
Lieutenant A. W.Greely, United States Army,
and of the party who had been engaged unÂ­
der his command in scientific observations
at Lady Franklin Bay. The fleet consisted of
the steam sealer Thetis, purchased la EngÂ­
land; the Bear, purchased at St. Johns, NewÂ­
foundland, and the Alert, which was generÂ­
ously provided by the British Government.
Preparations for the expedition were
promptly made by the Secretary of the Navy,
with the active co-operation of the Secretary
of War. Commander George W. Coffin was
placed In command of the Alert, and LieuÂ­
tenant W. H. Emery In command of the Bear.
The Thetis was intrusted to Commander
Wenfield S. Copley, to whom also was asÂ­
Signed the superintendence ot the entire
expedition. Immediately upon Its arÂ­
rival at Upernavik the fleet began the
dangerous navigation - of Melville Bay,
and, in spite of every obstable, reached LitÂ­
tleton Island on June 22d, a fortnight earlier
than any vessel had before attained that
point. On the same day it crossed over to
Cape Sabine, where Lieutenant Greely and
the other survisors of his party were discovÂ­
ered. After taking on board the living and
the bodies of the dead, the relief ships sailed
for St. Johns, where they arrived on July
17th. They were appropriately received at
Portsmouth, N. IL, on August 1st, and at New
Y'ork on August 8th. One of the bodies was
landed at the former place, - The others were
put on shore at - Governor's Island,- and,
with the exception of one which was InÂ­
terred ha the National Cemetery, were forÂ­
warded thence to the destination indicated
by friends. The . organization and conduct
oi this relief expedition reflects great credit

ThR rnrTt of the Postmaster-General ac
quaints you with the present condition
and the needs of the postal service. It disÂ­
closes the gratifying fact that the loss of

system is in operation, ana it appears tnas as
those offices where the carrier system is In
operation that the increase in the tax upon
local letters defrays the cost not only oi its
own collection and delivery, but of the colÂ­
lection and delivery of all other mail matter.
This Is an inequality that ought no longer to
exist. . ....
UNITY OF WEIGHT. .
I approve the recommendation of the Post
master-General that the unit of weights in
the rating of first-class matter should be one
ounce instead of one-half ounce as it now is.
In view of the statistics furnished by the de
partment it may well be doubted whether the
cnange wouiu result in any loss oi revenue.
That it wonld srreatlv rjromote the conveni
ence of the public is beyond dispute. The
free delivery system has been lately applied
to five cities, and the total number of offices
in which it is now in operation is 159. Jx
perlence shows that its adoption under
proper conditions is equally an aecommoaa
tion to the public and an advantage to the
postal service, it is more thanself-sustaining,
and for the reasons urged by thePostmaster-General
may be properly extended.
EXCEPTIONAL DISPATCH. ,
It Is the' opinion of that officer that it Is
proper to provide means wnereoy excepÂ­
tional dispatch in dealing with letters In
free delivery offices may be secured by
paying extraordinary postage. This scheme
might be made effective by the employment
oi a special stamp wnose coss snouia oe
commensurate with the expenses of the ex
tra service. In some of the large cities

OR. TALMAGE SAYS THEY ARE INÂ­
FLLCTED FOR A PURPOSE.
We Should Strive to Overcome the
Troubles of Life-With the Help of
God's Grace Petty Grievances BeÂ­

[Copyright, Louis I(lopsch. .1899,]





WASHINGTON, Oct. 8.-This sermon
by Dr. Talmage deals with a subject
which appeals to all classes and condiÂ­
tions of men. His text is Deuteronomy
vii, 20, ""The Lord thy God will-send
the hornet.""
It seems as if the insectile world
were determined to extirpate the huÂ­
man race. It bombards the grainfields
and the orchards and the vineyards.
The Colorado beetle, the Nebraska
grasshopper, the New Jersey locust,
the universal potato beetle, seem to
carry on the work which was begun
ages ago when the insects buzzed out
of Noah's ark as the door was opened.
In my text the hornet flies out on its
mission. It is a species of wasp, swift
in its motion and violent in its sting..
Its touch is torture to man or beast.
We have all seen the cattle run bellowÂ­
ing under the cut of its lancet. In boyÂ­
hood;.}'e used to stand cautiously lookÂ­
` ifi;~g.attlm globular nest hung from the
tree branch, and while we were lookÂ­
ing at the wonderful covering we were
struck with something that sent us
shrieking away. The hornet goes in
swarms. It has captains over hunÂ­
dreds, and 20 of them alighting on one
man will produce certain death.
The Persians attemhpted to conquer a
Christian city, but the elephants and
the beasts on which the Persians rode
were assaulted by the hornet, so that
the whole army was broken up and the
besieged city was rescued. This burnÂ­
ing and noxious insect stung out the
Hittites and the Canaanites from their
country. What gleaming sword and
chariot of war could not accomplish
was done by the puncture of an insect.
""The Lord sent the hornet.""
My friends, when we are assaulted by
great behemoths of trouble we become
chivalric, and we assault them. We
get on the high mottled steed of our
courage, and we make a cavalry charge
at them, and if God be with us we
come out stronger and better than
when we went it. But alas for these
insectile annoyances of life, these foes
too small to shoot, these things withÂ­
out any avoirdupois weight, the gnats
and the midges and the flies and the
wasps and the hornets! In other
wards, It is the small, stinging annoyÂ­
ances of our life which drive us out
and use us up. In the best conditioned
life for some grand and glorious purÂ­
pose God has sent the hornet.
IIumanity Overworked.
I remark, in the first place, that these
small, stinging annoyances may come
in the shape of a nervous organization.
People who are prostrated under tyÂ­
phoid fevers or with broken bones get
plenty of sympathy, but who pities
anybody that is nervous? The doctors
say and the family say and everybody
says, ""Oh, she's only a little nervous;
that's all!"" The sound of a heavy foot,
the harsh clearing of a throat, a disÂ­
cord in music, a want of harmony beÂ­
tween the shawl and the glove on the
same person, a curt answer, a passing
slight, the wind from the east, any one
of ten thousand annoyances, opens the
door for the hornet. The fact is that
the vast majority of the people in this
country are overworked, and their
nerves are the first to give out. A
great multitude are under the strain of
Leyden, who, when he was told by his
physician that if he did not stop workÂ­
ing while he was in such poor physical
health he would die, responded, ""DocÂ­
tor, whether I live or die, the wheel
must keep going round."" These sensiÂ­
tive persons of whom I speak have a
bleeding sensitiveness. The flies love
to light on anything raw, and these
people are like the Canaanites spoken
of in the text or in the context-they
have a very thin covering and are vulÂ­
nerable at all points. ""And the Lord
sent the hornet.""
Again, the small insect annoyances
may come to us in the shape of friends
and acquaintances who are always sayÂ­
ing disagreeable things. There are
some people you cannot be with for
half an hour but you feel cheered and
comforted. Then there are other peoÂ­
ple you cannot be with for five minutes
before you feel miserable. They do not
mean to disturb you, but they sting
you to the bone. They gather up all
the yarn which the gossips spin and
retail it. Tlhey gather up all the adÂ­
verse criticisms about your person,
about your business, about your home,
about your church, and they make your
ear the funnel into which they pour it.
They laugh heartily when they tell
you, as though it were a good joke, and
you laugh, too-outside.
Job's Comxforters.
These people are brought to our atÂ­
tention In the Bible, In the book of
Ruth. Naomi went forth, beautiful
and with the finest of worldly prosÂ­
poets, into another land, but after
awhile she came back widowed and
sick and poor. What did her' friends
do when she came to the city?. They
all went out, and. instepd of giving her
common sense consolation, what did
they do? Rcad the boolk of Ruth and
find out. They threw up their hands
and said, ""Is this Naomi?"" as much as
to say, ""How awful bad you do look!""
WVhen I entered the ministry, I looked
very pale for years, and every year,
for four or five years, many times a
year I was asked if I had not conÂ­
sumption, and, passing throughl tlhe
room, 1 would sometimes hear people
sigh and say. ""A-ah, not long for this
world!"" I resolved in those times that
I never in any conversation would say
anything depressing, and by the help
of God I have kept the resolution.
These people of whom I speak reap
and bind In the great harvest field of
discouragement. Some day you greet




 them with a hilarious ""Good morning,""
and they come buzzing at you with
some depressing information; ""The
Lord sent the hornet,""
It is astonishing how some people
prefer to write and to say disagreeable
things. That was the case when HenÂ­
ry M. Stanley returned after his magÂ­
nificent exploit of finding David LivÂ­
ingstone. When 'Mr. Stanley stood beÂ­
fore the savants of Europe and many
of. the small critics of the day, under
pretense of getting geographical inÂ­
formation, put to him most insolent
questions, he folded his arms and reÂ­
fused to answer. At the very time
when you would suppose all decent
men would have applauded the heroÂ­
islu of the man there were those to
hiss. ""The Lord sent the hornet."" And
when afterward that man sat down on
the western coast of Africa, sick and
worn out, with perhaps the grandest
achievement of the age in the way of
geographical discovery, there were
small critics all over the world to buzz
and buzz and caricature and deride
him, and when after awhile he got the
London papers, as he opened them,
out flew the hornet. When I see that
there are so many people in the world
who like to say disagreeable things
and write disagreeable things, I come
almost in my .weaker moments to beÂ­
lieve what a man said to me in PhilaÂ­
delphia one Monday morning. I went
to get the horse at the livery stable,
and the hostler, a plain man, said to
me, ""Mr. Talmage, I saw that you
preached to the young men yesterday.""
I said, ""Yes."" Hle said: ""No use, no
use. Man's a failure.""
Domestic Disturbances.
The small insect annoyances of life
sometimes come in the shape of local
physical trouble which does not
amount to a positive prostration, but
which bothers you when you want to
feel the best. Perhaps it is a sick
headache which has been the plague of
your life, and you appoint some occaÂ­
sion of mirth or sociality or usefulness,
and when the clock strikes the hour
you cannot make your appearance.
Perhaps the trouble is between the
ear and the forehead in the shape of
a neuralgic twinge. Nobody can see it
or sympathize with it, but just at the
time whenu you want your intellect
clearest and your disposition brightest
you feel a sharp, keen, disconcerting
thrust. ""The Lord sent the hornet.""
Perhaps these small insect annoyÂ­
ances will come in the shape of a doÂ­
mestic irritation. The parlor and the
kitchen do not always harmonize. To
get good service and to keep it is one of
the great questions of the country.
Sometimes it may be the arrogance
and inconsiderateness of employers;
but, whatever be the fact, we all admit
there are these insect annoyances
winging their way out from the culiÂ­
nary department. If the grace of God
be not in the heart of the housekeeper,
she cannot maintain her equilibrium.
The men come home at night and hear
the story of these annoyances and say,
""Oh, these home troubles are very litÂ­
tle things!"" They are small, small as
wasps, but they sting. Martha's nerves
were all unstrung when she rushed in
asking Christ to scold Mary, and there
are tens of thousands of wonmen who
are dying, stung to death by these pesÂ­
tiferous domestic annoyances. ""The
Lord sent the hornet.""
These small insect disturbances may
also come in the shape of business irÂ­
ritations. There are men here who
went through the 24th of September,
1869, and the panics of 1873 and of
1803 without losing their balance who
are every day unhorsed by little anÂ­
noyances-a clerk's ill manners, or a
blot of ink on a bill of lading, or the
extravagance of a partner who overÂ­
draws his account, or the underselling
by a business rival, or the whispering
of store confidences in the street, or the
making of some little bad debt which
was against your judgment, but you
wanted to please somebody else.
It is not the panics that kill the merÂ­
chants. Panics come only once in 10 or
20 years. It is the constant din of these
everyday annoyances which is sending
so many of our best merchants into
nervous dyspepsia and paralysis and
the grave. When our national comÂ­
merce fell flat on its face, these men
stood up and felt almost defiant, but
their life is going away now under the
swarm of these pestiferous annoyÂ­
ances, ""The Lord sent the hornet.""
Keep on Moving.
I have noticed in the history of some
of my congregation that their annoyÂ­
ances are multiblying and that they
have a hundred where they used to
have ten. Time naturalist tells us that
a wasp sometimes has a family of 20,Â­
000 wasps, and it does seem as if evÂ­
ery annoyance of your life brooded a
million. By thie help of God, today I
want to show -you thie other side. Tihe
hornet is of no use? Oh, yes! The natÂ­
uralist tells us they are very important
in the world's economy. They kill spiÂ­
ders, and they clear the atmosphere.
And I really believe God sends thie anÂ­
noyances of our life upon us to kill the
spiders of thie soul anld to clear the atÂ­


These annoyances are sent on us, I
think, to wake us up from our letharÂ­
gy. There Is nothing that makes a
man so lively as a nest of ""yellow jackÂ­
ets,"" and I think that these unnoyÂ­
ances are Intended to persuade us of
the fact that this is not a world for
us to stop In. If we had a bed of evÂ­
erything that was attractive and soft
and easy, what would we want of
heaven? We think that the hollow tree
sends the hornet, or we may think that
i the devil sends the hornet. I want to
correct your opinion. ""The Lord sent
the hornet.""
Then I think these annoyances come
on us to cultivate our patience. In the
gymnasinuml you fi(nd upright :arallel
bars with holes over each other for
pegs to be put In. Then the gymnast
takes a peg in each hand, and lie beÂ­
gins to climb, one inch at a time cr
two inches, and, getting his strength
cultivated, reaches after awhile the

 ceiling. And it seems to me that these
annoyances in life are a moral gymnaÂ­
sium, each worrlulent -. a peg with
which we are to climb higher and highÂ­
er in Christian attainment. We all love
to see patience, but It cannot be cultiÂ­
vated in fair weather. Patience is a
child of the storm. If you had everyÂ­
thing desirable and there was nothing
more to get, what would you want
with patience? The only time to cultiÂ­
vate it is when you are lied about and
sick and half dead.
""0h,"" you say, ""if I only had the cirÂ­
cumstances of some well to do man I
would be patient too."" Youi might as
well say, ""If it were not for this waÂ­
ter, I would swim,"" or, ""I could shoot
this gun if it were not for the carÂ­
tridge."" When you stand chin deep
in annoyances is the time for you. to
swim out toward the great headlands
of Christian attainment, so as to
""know Christ and the power of his
resurrection and to have fellowship
with his sufferings.""
Trust In Chrisnt.
Nothing but the furnace will ever
burn out of us the clinker and the slag.
I have formed this theory in regard to
small annoyances and vexations. It
takes just so much trouble to fit us for
usefulness and for heaven. The only
question is whether we shall take it in
the bulk or pulverized and granulated.
Here is one man who takes it in the
bulk. His back is broken or his eyeÂ­
sight put out, or some other awful caÂ­
lamity befalls him, while the vast maÂ­
jority of people take the thing pieceÂ­
meal. Which way would you rather
have it? Of course, in piecemeal.
Better have five aching teeth 'than
one broken jaw, better 10 fly blisters
than an amputation, better 20 squalls
than one cyclone. There may be a
difference of opinion as to allopathy
and homeopathy, but in this matter of
trouble I like homeopathic doses, small
pellets of annoyance rather than some
knockdown dose of calamity. Instead
of the thunderbolt give us the hornet.
if you have a bank, you would a great
deal rather that 50 men would come in
with checks less than $100 than to
have two depositors come in the same
day, each wanting his $10,000. In this
latter case you cough and look down
to the floor and you look up to the ceilÂ­
ing before you look into the safe. Now,
my friends, would you not rather have
these small drafts of annoyance on
your bank of faith than some all stagÂ­
gering demand upon your endurance?
But remember that little as well as
great annoyances equally require you
to trust in Christ for succor and for
deliverance from impatience and irritaÂ­
bility. ""Thou wilt keep him in perfect
peace whose mind is staid on thee.""
In the village of Hamuelin, tradition
says, there was an invasion of rats, and
these small creatures almost devoured
the town and threatened the lives of
the population, and the story is that a
piper came out one day and played a
very sweet tune, and all the vermin
followed him, followed him to the
banks of the Weser, and then he blew
a blast, and they dropped in and disÂ­
appeared forever. Of course this is a
fable; but I wish I could on the sweet
flute of the gospel draw forth all the
nibbling and burrowing annoyances of
your life and play them down into the
depths forever.
Aids to Spfritfldt Wenlth.
How many touches did Mr. Church
give to his picture of ""Cotopaxkl"" or his
""Heart of the Andes?"" I suppose about
50,000 touches. I hear the canvas sayÂ­
ing: ""Why do you keep me trembling
with that pencil so long? Why don't
you put it on in one dash?"" ""No,"" says
Mr. Church; ""I know how to make a
painting. It will take 50,000 of these
touches."" And I want you, my friends,
to understand that it is these ten thouÂ­
sand.annoyances which under God are
making up the picture of your life, to
be hung at last in the galleries of heavÂ­
en, fit for angels to look at. God knows
how to make a picture.
I go into a sculptor's studio and see
him shaping a statue. He has a chisel
in one hand and a mallet in the other,
and he gives a very gentle strokeÂ­
click, click, click! I say, ""Why don't
you strike harder?"" ""Oh,"" he replies,
""that would shatter the statue. I can't
do it that way. I must do it this way.""
So he works on, and after awhile the
features come out, and everybody that
enters the studio is charmed and fasÂ­
cinated. Well, God has your soul under
process of development, and it is the
little annoyances and vexations of life
that are chiseling out your immortal
nature. It is click, click, click! I wonÂ­
der why some great providence does
not come and with one stroke prepare
you for heaven. Ah, no! God says that
is not the way, aItd so he keeps on by
strokes of little vexations until at last
you shall be a glad spectacle for angels
and for imen.
You know that a large fortune may
be spent in small clhange, and a vast
amount of inormli charnacter may go
away in small depletions. It is the litÂ­
tle troubles of life that are having
more effect upon y'ou than great ones.

or four cattle. You say. ""Since I lost
my child, since I lost my property, I
have been a different 'man."" But you
do not recognize the architecture of litÂ­
tle annoyances that are hewing, digÂ­
ging, cutting, shaping, splitting and inÂ­
tcrjoining your moral qualities. Rats
mny sink a ship. One lucifer match
may send destruction through a block
of storehouses. Catherine de' Medici
got her death from sInelling a poisonÂ­
ous rose. Columbus, by stopping and
asking for a piece of bread and a drink
of water alt a Franciscan convent, was
led to the discovery of a new world.
And there is an intimate connection beÂ­
tween trifles and immnensities, between
nothings anld everythings.
Now, lbe canreful to let none of tho<t-.
annioyances go through your soul unmarÂ­
raigned. Compel them to ldminnister to
your spiritual wealth. The scratch of
a sixpenny nail sonietimes produces
lockjaw, and the clip of a most inÂ­




 illltesimal annoyance may damage you
forever, Do not let any annoyance or,
perplexity come across your soul withÂ­
out its making you better.

Our national government when It
wanted money did not think it belitÂ­
tling to lut a: tax on pnlus and a tax on
buckles and a tax on shoes. The indlÂ­
vilual taixes do not amount to much,
but in the ""lgigregate to millions and
Iillions of dollars. Ald I would have
you, 0 Christian man, put a high tariff
onl every annoyance antl vexation that
comes through youlr soul. This mnight
lnot amlnount to much in single cases,
but in the aggregate it would be a
gleat revenue of spiritual strength and
tisftisetion. A bee can suck honey
even out of a nettle, and if you have
the gra'ce of God in your heart you can
get sweetness oult of that which would
otherwise irritate and annoy.
A returned missionary told me that a
colnpany of adventurers rowing up the
(;anues were stung to death by flies
that infest that region at certain seaÂ­
sons. The ealrth has been strewed with
the carclss-es of mlen slain by Insect
anitnoyances. The only way to get preÂ­
pared for the great troubles of life is to
conquer these small troubles. What
would you say of a soldier who refused
to load his gun or to go into the conilict
because it was only a skirmish, saying:
""I am not going to expend my anuniulÂ­
tiOn on a skirmilsh. Wait until there
comnes a general engagement, and then
you will see how courageous I am and
what battling I will do?"" Tile general
would say to such a man, ""If you are
not faithful in a skirmish, you would
he nothing inl a general engagenment.""
And I have to tell you, O' Christian
men, if you cannot apply the principles
of Christ's religion on a small scale
you will never be able to apply them
on a large scale. If I had my way with
you, I would have you possess all posÂ­
sible worldly prosperity. I would have
you each one a garden, a river Ilowing
through it, geraniums and shrubs on
tile sides and the grass and flowers as
beautiful as though'the rainbow had
fallen. I would have you a house, a
splendid mansion, and the beds should
be covered with upholstery dipped in
the setting sun. I would have every hall
in your house set with statues and
statuettes, and then I would hlave the
four quarters of the globe pour in all
their luxuries on your table, and you
should have forks of silver and knives
of gold, inlaid .with diamluonds and
anlethysts. Then you should each one
of you have thile finest horses and your
pick of the equipages of the world.
Then I would have you live 150 years,
and you should not have a pain or an
ache until the last breath.
God', Blessings.
""Not each one of us?"" you say. Yes,
each one of you. ""Not to your eneÂ­
mies?"" Yes. The only difference I
would mnake with them would be that
I would put a little extr'a gilt on their
walls and a little extra embroidery on
their slippers. But, you say, ""Why
does not God give us all these things?""
Ah! I bethink myself. IIe is wiser. It
would make fools and sluggards of us
if we had our way. No man puts his
best picture in the portico or vestibule
of his house. God meant this world to
be only the vestibule of heaven, that
great gallery of the universe toward
which we are aspiring. We must not
have it too good in this world or we
would want no heaven.
Polyearp was condemned to be burnÂ­
ed to death. The stake was planted,
Hie was fastened to It. The fagots
Were placed around him, the fires kinÂ­
dled, but history tells us that the
flames bent outward like the canvas of
a ship in a stout breeze, so that the
flames, instead of destroying Polycarp,
were only a wall between him and his
enemies. Tley had actually to destroy
hint with the poniTrd. The flames
would not touch him. Well, my hearÂ­
er, I want you to understand that by
God's grace the flames of trial, instead
of consuming your soul, are only going
to be a wall of defense, and a canopy
of blessing. God is going to .fulfill to
you the blessings ant the promises, as
he did to Polycarp. ""When thou walkÂ­
est through the fire, thou shalt not be
burned."" Now you do not understand,
but you shall know hereafter. In heavÂ­

The human family now living on the
earth consists of 1,450,000,000 individ- a
uals; not less than this number and to
probably more. They are so distributed t
over the earth's surface that there are t
now no parts of any size still uninhab- tc
ited. In Asia, where there is little w
doubt the human race first existed, ""
there are now approximately about 800,Â­
000, an average for the entire conÂ­
Â¶ t of 120 to the square mile. The)
cheerless and thinly populated steppes t(
of Siberirntduce the average of popu- is
lation for this continent, which in some
parts is the most closely packed quarter
of the globe. Thus, throughout HindoÂ­
stan an average of 172 persons to the
square mile, and in Ciina proper each
square mile represents a population of
226. The population of Europe is about
850,000,000, averaging 100 to the square
mile, not so crowded as in Asia, but
everywhere dense, and overpopulated 6
at all points. Africa has an estimatÂ­
ed population of some 210,000,000. or
about eighteen to the sqanre mile. But I
this can be a mere approximation only,
as so much of the continent is still unÂ­
explored. America has a population
estimated at about 105,000,000, relaÂ­
tively thinly scattered, and averaging
altogether not more than seven to the
square mile. On all the islands of the
oceans there are probably 10,000,000 of
inhabitant. The white people of the
hugmn race are estimated at about 550,Â­
000,000, the blacks at some 250,000,000;
the reit are of intermediate color. Of
the entire race some 500,000,000 are
well clothed, that is comfortably and
entirely; 700,000,000 are partly clothed,
and some 250.000,000 are practically
naked. Some 500,000,000 may be said
tclhve in houses partly furnished with

I his arrival was being announced. Applause,
d
clapwing of hands at first and then cheers,
.t loud and prolonged, welcomed him. Then a
e stalwart voice in the gallery arose above the
a din, demanding ""Three cheers for Grover

'PHE INAUGURATION.
Scenes On and About the Stand Where the.
Solemn Ceremony Took Place.
WASHINGTON, March 4.-The stand on
which the president was to deliver his inÂ­
augural address was erected almost on a level
with the floors of the senate and: the house
and directly in front of the middle entrance
to the capitol. It was about 100 feet square,
the largest ever before erected for aninaugnÂ­
ration, and was covered by 2,000 chairs.
These were occupied by senators, memÂ­
bers of the diplomatic corps and judges of
the supreme court, members of the house of
representatives and press representatives..
Before the prosident left the senate chamber
the crowd in front of the stand had increased
until it became one solid mass of humanity
400 feet in front of the stand, and more thon
100 on either side. The crowd continued
less solidly in the :rear of this multitude.
The trees in the great lawns
. were
filled and the roofs of the surrounding
dwellings-were covered. On the roof of the
capitol some 200 or 300 men and boys had
congregated. In approaching avenues and
streets the military companies and society
organizations were massed in columns, formÂ­
ing a brilliant vista as far as the eye could
reach. On elevated stands enterprising.
photographers had placed their instruments
to perpetuate in photographic designs the
assembly on the stand, and the sea of
hats and faces that moved continually
like waves "" of the ocean. This
immense throng was variously estimated as
to numbers. President Arthur subsequently
said it was ""simply immense; the greatest
crowd he ever saw."" Seiator Hawley, as he
looked at it, ;,aid he thought it numbered
about 150,000 people. While waiting for the
arrival of the president-elect, some one would
occasionally venuture in front of the platÂ­
form, and his presence was. the signal for
repeated cheerÂ°.
Precisely at 12:30 the head of the proÂ­
cession appeared coming out 'df the main
east door of the capitol. President Arthur
stepped to the front of the platform, folÂ­
lowed by the president-elect, Chief-Justice
Waite and the sergeant-at-arms 'of 'the senÂ­
ate. All uncovered as they stood facing
the crowd, and the vast assemblage cheered
again and again
- for . several minutes,
When the persons who were to assist at the
ceremonies wereÂ­ seated -on the platform,
President-elect Cleveland began his' inauÂ­
gural address. He was clad in a full suit of
black, Prince Albert coat, high oldÂ­
fashioned 'staiiding collar and black tie. In
speaking he held his left hand dclosed behind
him and emphasized his speech by gestures
with his right hand. He spoke without
manuscript, but occasionally consulted
.
small piece of paper bearing the notes of his
discourse. His voice was clear and resonant,
and he slowly enunciated his words and ocÂ­
casionally turned about at pauses, as if to
note the effect of his remarks.
CLEVELAND'S ADDRESS.
The Brief Speech Delivered by the Chief of the
New Administration.
WASHINGSTON, M;arlh 4.-President CleveÂ­
land's inaugural address was as follows:
""Fellow Citizens: In the presence of this
vast assemblage of my countrymen, I ain


auouUs to uppittueub allu ea uy Liue UL11
which I shall take the manifestations of tlir--Â­
will of a great and free people. In the exerÂ­
cise of their power and right of self-governÂ­
ment, they have committed to one of their
fellow-citizens a supreme and sacred trust,
and he here consecrates himself to their serÂ­
vice. This impressive ceremony adds little
to the solemn sense of responsibility with
which I couteniplate' the duty I owe to all
people of the land; nothing can relieve me
from anxiety lest by any act of mine their
interests may suffer, and nothing is needed
to strengthen my resoluhition to engage every
faculty and effort in the promotion of their
welfare.
""Amid the din of party strife the people's
choice was made, but its attendant circumÂ­
stances have demonstrated a new strength
and safety of government by the people..
In each succeeding year it more clearly apÂ­
pears that our Democratic principle needs
no apology, and that in its fearless and.
faithful application is to be found the surest
guaranty of good government. But the best
results in the operation of a government,
wherein every citizen has a share, largely
depend upon the proper limitation of purely
partisan zeal and effort, and a correct appreÂ­
ciation of the time when t 4e !-""'it of the parÂ­
tisan should be merged in the patriotism of
the citizen. To-day the executive branch of
the government is transferred to new keepÂ­
ing. But this is still a government of all the
people and it should be none the less an obÂ­
ject of their affectionate solicitude. At this
hour the animosities of political strife, the'
bitterness of partisan defeat and the exultaÂ­
tion of partisan triumph,Â­ should be supÂ­
planted by ungrudging acquiescence in the
popular will, and a sober and conscientious
concern for the general weal. Moreover, if
from this hour we cheerfully and honestly
abandon all sectional prejudice and distrust
and determine with manly confidence in one
another to work out harmoniously achieveÂ­
ments of our national destiny, we shall deÂ­
serve to realize all the benefits which our
happy form of government can bestow.
TilE CONSTITUTION.
""On this auspicious occasion we may well
renew the pledge of our devotion to the conÂ­
stitution which, launched by the founders of
the republic and consecrated by their prayÂ­
ers and patriotic devotion, has for almost a
century borne the hopes and aspirations of a
great people through prosperity and peace
and through the shock of foreign conflicts
and the perils of domestic strife and vicissiÂ­
tudes. By the father' of this country our
constitution was commended for adoption as
'the result of a spirit of amity and mutual
concession.' In that same spirit it should'
be administered in order to promote the lastÂ­
E
ing welfare of the country and to secure t e
Sfull
measure of its priceless benefi
to us and to those who will succeed
to the .blessings of our national life.
Tbe large variety 6f diverse and competing
Sinterests subject to Federal control, persistÂ­
ently seeking the recognition of their claims,
need give us no fear that 'the -greatest' good
to the greatest number' will fail to be acÂ­
complished if in the halls of national legislaÂ­
tion that spirit of amity and mutual concesÂ­
sions shall prevail in which the constitution
had its birth. If this involves the surrender
or postponement of private interests and the
abandonment of local advantages, compensaÂ­
1
tion will be found in the assurance that thus





the common interest is subserved and the rj
general welfare advanced. iml
DUTIES OF CITIZENS. oat
""In the discharge of my official duty I clul
shall endeavor to be guided by a just and unÂ­ doe
restrained construction of the constitution, a ant
careful observance of the distinction between wa!
the powers granted to the Federal governÂ­ che
ment and those reserved to the states, or the Ar
people, and - by a cautious appreciation of the
those functions which,
. by the constiÂ­ Me
tution and laws, have been especially 1
assigned to the executive branch of the
the government. But he who takes the oath to
to-day to preserve, protect and defend the Th
constitution of the United States, only asÂ­ prE
sumes the solemn obligation which every paÂ­ his
triotic citizen, in the workshop, in the, busy wa
marts of trade and everywhere should share to i
with him. The constitution which prescribes int
his oath, my countrymen, is yours; the govÂ­ be
ernment you have chosen him to administrate ho,
for a time, is yburs. The suffrage which exÂ­
ecutes the will of freemen, is yours; the laws
and the entire scheme of our civil rule, from A
the town meeting to the state capitols and the
national capitol is yours; your every voter,
as surely as your chief magistrate, under the of
same high sanction, though in a different ese
sphere, exercises a public trust. Nor is this W
all. Every citizen owes to the country a tai
vigilant watch and close scrutiny of the pubÂ­ Ax
licservants, and a fair and reasonable estiÂ­ ser
mate of their fidelity and usefulness. Thus tio
is the people's will impressed upon the Th
whoie framework of our civil polity-muÂ­ al
nicipal, state and federal-and this is the wa
price of our liberty and the inspiration of our to
faith in the republic. ins
DUTIES OF OFFICIALS. co,
""It is the duty of those serving the people cec
in public place, to. closely limit public exÂ­ Fi
penditures to the actual needs of government, ca
economically administered, because this pr
bounds the right of the government to exact of
tribute from the earnings of labor or property wl
of citizens, and because public extravagance TI
begets extravagance among the people. We Fi
should never be ashamed of the simplicity be
and prudential economies -which are best he
suited to the operation of a republican form W
of government and most compatible with the re
mnission of the Americanpeople.
- Those who re,
are selected for a limited time to manage di:
publid affairs are still of the people and may de
do much by their example to encourage, conÂ­
sistently with the dignity of their official
functions, that plain way of life which, de
among their fellow-citizens, aids integrity sel
and promotes thrift and prosperity. de
FOREIGN POLICY, pr
""The genius of our institutions, the needs fi
of our people in their home life, and the atÂ­ at
tention which is demanded for the settlement ch
and development of the resources of our vast sin
territory, dictate the scrupulous avoidance th
of any departure from that foreigti policy in
commended by the history, the tradition and A
the prosperity of our republic. It is the H
policy of indevendence favored by our posiÂ­ ht
tion and defenaed by our love of justice and of
by our power. It is the policy of peace suitaÂ­ fit
ble to our interests. It is the policy of neuÂ­ in
trality rejecting any share in foreign broils wl
and ambitions upon other continents and reÂ­ w,
pelling their intrusion here. It is the poliÂ­ IL
cy of Monroe and Washington and Jefferson G
-of :peace, commerce and honest friendship N
with all nations, entangling alliances with N
none.' E
THE FINANCES. at
""A due regard for the interests and prosÂ­ at
perity of all the people demand that our la
finances shall be established upon such a in
sound and sensible basis as shall secure the at
safety and confidence of business interests wi
and msnake the wages of labor sure and steady, th
and that our system of revenue shall be so sc
adjusted as to relieve the people from unÂ­ th
necessary taxation, having a due regard to
the interests of capital invested and workingÂ­
men employed in American industries, and pi
preventing the accumulation of a surplus in Im
the treasury to tempt extravagance and fr
waste., ce
PUBLIC DOMAIN. st
""The care for the property of the nation p,
and the needs for future settlers, require that fr
the public domain should be protected from em
purloining schemes and unlawful occupation. ft
The conscience of the people demands that p
the Indians within our borders shall be fairly n
and honesAtly treated as wards of the governÂ­ im
ment, and their education and civilization el
promoted, with a view to their ultimate citiÂ­ a'
zensiip; and that polygamy in the territories, fi
destructive of the family relation and nfÂ­ tl
fensive to the moral sense of the civilized tI
world, shall be repressed.
FOREIGN CONTRACT LABOR. p
""The laws should be rigidly enforced w


rwhich prohibit the emigration of a servile n
class to compete with American labor, with `5
no. intention of acquiring citizenship, and g
bringing with them the retaining habits and g
customs so repugnant to our civilization. c
AD3IINISTRATIVE REFORM.
""The people demand reform in the adminÂ­ I
istration of the government and the appliÂ­ g
cation of business principles to the public afÂ­ t
fairs. As a means to this end civil-service t
reform should be in good faith enforced. t
Our citizens have the right to protection g
from the incompetency of public employds I
who hold their places solely as the reward I
of partisan service and from the corruptive 7
influence of those who promise, and the r
vicious methods of those who expect such I
rewards, and those who worthily seek public
employment have thought to insist that I
merit and competency shall be recognized inÂ­
stead of party subserviency, and the surrender f
of honest political belief in the administraÂ­
tion of a government pledged to do equal and
exact judgment to all men.
.
THE COLORED RACE.
""There should be no pretext for anxiety
touching the protection of the freedmen in
their rights or their security or the enjoyÂ­
ment of their privileges under the constituÂ­
tion and its amendments. All discussion as
to their fitness for the place accorded to them
as American citizens, is idle and unprofitaÂ­
ble except as it suggests the necessity for
their improvement. The fact that they are
citizens entitles them to all the rights due to
the relation, and charges them with all its
duties, obligations and responsibilities.
""These topics and the constant and everÂ­
varying wants of an active and enterprising
population may well receive the attention
and the patriotic endeavor of all who make
4nd execute the Federal law. Our duties are
practical and call for industrious applihcation,
an intelligent perception of the claims of
public office, and above all a firm determinaÂ­
tion by united action to secure to all the peoÂ­
ple in the land the full benefit of the best
form of government ever vouchsafed to man,
and let us not trust to human effort alone,
but humbly acknowledge the power and goodÂ­
ness of Almighty God, who presides over the
destiny of nations and who has at all times
been revealed in our country's history; let
us invoke His aid and His blessing upon our
labors.""
THE OATH TAKEN.
SPresident Cleveland Duly Sworn in by the Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court.
WASIISN(TON, March 4.--When Mr. CleveÂ­
land first began his inaugural address the
crowd applauded whenever he paused to take
breath, but after awhile contented itself with
cheering him as he made his principal points.
His reference to the prohibition of foreign
contract labor called out loudand long-cpntinÂ­
ued applause; but his allusion to civil-service
reform met with a faint response. The adÂ­
dress was very brief, and at1:02 o'clock it
was concluded, with an invocation of the
blessing of providence, and, turning to the
chief justice and bowing to him Mr. CleveÂ­
land said:
""I am now prepared to take the oath preÂ­
scribed by law.""
As the chiefjustice arose to administer the
oath the vast assemblage cheered again and
again.
The president-elect stood facing the chief
justice, with the crowd on his right. Chief
Clerk MceKenney, of the supreme court,
stood just to one side of Cleveland and held
the bible upon which the oath was adminisÂ­
tered, the president-elect also holding it with
his right hand. The bible used is a small
morocco-covered, gilt-edged volume, pretty
well worn. It is the bible which Cleyeland's
mother gave him when he left home as a
young man, and at his special request the
committee of arrangements had it in readiÂ­
hess for the ceremony.

 The crowd preserved perfect quiet as the an(
impressive ceremony of administering the bar
oath was taking place, but when it was conÂ­ De
eluded, and as President. Cleveland laid Fil
down the Bible, after reverently -kissing it, anm
and shook hands wit-h the chief justice, who lar
was. the first to congratulate him, they pu
cheered loudly and long. Ex-President co:
Arthur was the second man to congratulate Yc
the president, and then followed Chief Clerk
McKenney and Senator Sherman. mt
President Cleveland .was then introduced to br<
the remaining judges of the supreme court, no
to Lieut.-Gen. Sheridan and Gen. Hancock. ha
The other persons on the platform then bhi
pressed forward', and many of them shook ca
his hand.' As he reentered the capitol he an
was again greeted with cheers. He walked Fi
to the basement entrance, where hlie first came di
into the building, and entered his carriage to D+
be driven. in the procession to the White fo
house. N
S THE GRAND PARADE. (
A ""Glittering Pageant of 26,oo 'Soldiers and im
Civilians Reviewed by the New.President.
TWASHINGTON, March 4.-At the conclusion
of the ceremonies at the capitol the procession th
escorted the presidential party back to the cc
White house. The two carriages, which conÂ­ hi
tamied President Cleveland, ex-President Ti
Arthur, Vice-President Hendricks and the tb
senate committee on arrangements, took posiÂ­ te
tions in the First division and the line started. gi
The greatest enthusiasm was manifested all cl
along the route. The crowd on the sideÂ­ kt
walks had increased so that it was impossible fo
to pass through it. Many people were forced T1
into the roadway, and the police had all they ot
coulddo to keep the avenue open for the proÂ­ im
cession. When the head of the line reached at
Fifteenth street a halt was made, and the hi
carriage containing the president and exÂ­ tli
president left the line, and proceeded by way d1
of Executive avenue to the White house, el
which the party entered by the rear door. c
The vice-president's carriage proceeded up aI
Fifteenth street nearly to New York avenue in
before leaving the line. Mr. Hendricks, d
however, soon joined the president at the ti
White house, and when everything was in ni
readiness the entire party proceeded to the le
reviewing stand on Pennsylvania avenue, m
directly in front of the mansion, and the orÂ­ E
der was given for the line to move. Pi
ON THE REVIEWING STAND. a
The reviewing stand had been profusely Pi
decorated with flags and bunting, and preÂ­ n
sented a beautiful appearance. The presiÂ­ R
dent and ex-president were placed on the si
projecting platform, which was covered with in
flags, so as to make a handsome canopy and w
at the same time so arranged as to afford a T
clear andÂ­ unobstructed view of the procesÂ­ P
sion. Armchairs were placed upon it for .Â­
their use, but the president remained standÂ­ 0'
ing during the entire review. Ex-President ai
I Arthur sat on his left. Vice-President r4
Hendricks and the members of his houseÂ­
hold occupied seats to the right and just back ai
i of the president, while the families and ri
friends of the president and ex-president sat bi
in the front row on the right. Among those 8(
s
who occupied seats on the presidential stand
were Secretaries Frelinghuysen, McCulloch,
Lincoln, Chandler and 'Teller, PostmasterÂ­ F
General Hatton, Lieut.-Gen. Sheridan, W
Maj.-Gen. Hancock, Daniel Manning, of ft
i
New York, Mr. Vilas, of Wisconsin, Mr. s
Endicott, of Massachusetts, Senators Bavard ii
and Garland, Col. Lamont, Mayor Grace t1
and ex-Mayor Cooper, of New York, and a ii
r
large number of other prominent persons, e
including many officers of the army and navy g
and members of the diplomatic corps. There a
s
were a great many ladies on the stand, and e
their rich costumes added brilliancy to the I
scene. It is estimated that theie were on
the stand about 1,000 persons. e
SA BRILLIANT PAGEANT.
It was ten minutes past 2 o'clock when the
1
president, escorted by Col. Berrett, of the a
I
Inaugural committee, took his place at the a
1
front of the stand, and the head of the proÂ­ t
cession started from the corner of Fifteenth F
street to pass in review. The president's apÂ­
pearance was the signal for a great shout C
t from the concourse of people, who had gathÂ­
a
ered in front of the stand and filled the street
. for several hundred yards both ways.. The
t president quietly bowed his acknoWledgeÂ­ n
y ments. A good deal of confusion was caused B
- in the vicinity of the grand st:and by the n
1 efforts of the police to clar the street for the A
- approaching procession. The work -was c
, finally accomplished, but with great difficulty,
the mounted police riding into the dense d
d
throng of spectators and driving them back t
wi'th their batons. The review from the r
presidential stand was a grand sight, and it d

"338","186251","Mr. TRUMBULL gave notice of a bill to enlarge the powers
of the Freedmen's Bureau so as to secure freedom to all perÂ­
sons within the United States, and protect every individual
in the full enjoyment of the rights of person and property,
and furnish them the means of their vindication.
Mr. TRUMBULL. In giving this notice I desire to say it is
given in view of the adoptiou of the constitutional amend.
mont abolishing slavery. Whatever diversity of opinion there
may be as to the'actual adoption of the amendment at this
time, in consequence of the abnormal condition of some of the
State Legislatures which have ratified it, there can be no doubt
that it will soon, and probably before action could be had in
Congress, have the sanction of a sufficient number of States to
put its adoption beyond cavil. I have never doubted that
under the second section of the amendment it would be comÂ­
petent for Congress to protect every person within the lnited
States in all the rights of person and property belonging to a
free citizen; and to secure those rights is the object of the bill
I propose to introduce. I think it importaut that action should
bi taken on this subject at an early day, both for the purpose
of quieting apprehensions in the minds of many friends of
freedom, lest by local legislation or a prevailing public sentiÂ­
ment in some of the States, persons of the African race should
continue to be oppressed, and in fact deprived of a true freeÂ­
dom: and for the purpose of showing to those among whom
slavery has heretfore existed, that unless they by local legisÂ­
lation provide for the real freedom of their former slaves, the
Federal Government will, by virtue of its authority, see that
they are fully protected.
Mr. WILSON introduced a resolution calling upon the SecreÂ­
tary of War tor informntion as to the number of major and
brigadier generals in the volunteer service, how and where
employedl, etc. Adopted.
Mr. ANTHONY moved that the Chair appoint the Special
Committee on Reconstruction provided for by a recent resoluÂ­
tion. Adopted.
Mr. ANTHONY offered a resolution that, until otherwise
ordered, all papers relating to the question of representation
of the States lately in rebellion be referred to the Special ComÂ­
mittee of Fifteen.
Mr. COWAN objected to the present consideration of the
above, and it went over under the rules.
Mr. COWAN said a message had just been received from the
President in response to a resolution calling for information as
to the condition of the States lately in rebellion. He called
for the reading of that message.
The message of the President was read, as follow s:
To the Senate oef te LSite;d States:
In reply to the resolution adopted by the Senate on the 12th
instant, 1 have the honor to state that the rebellion waged by
a portion of the people against the properly constituted anuÂ­
thority of the Government of the United. States has been supÂ­
pressed; that the United States are in possession of every
State in which the insurrection existed, and that, as far as it
could be done, the courts of the United States have been reÂ­
stored, post offices re.established, and steps taken to put into
effective operation the revenue laws of the country.
As the result of the measures instituted by the Executive,
with the view of inducing a resumption of the functions of the
States comprehended in the inquiry of the Senate, the people
of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, MidosÂ­
sippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee have reorganized
their respective State governments, and "" arevielding obedieace
to the laws and Government of the United dtatea,"" with more
willingness and greater promptitude than under the circumÂ­
stances could reasonably have been anticipated. The proposed
amendment of the Constitution, providing for the abolition of
slavery forever within the limits of the country, has been ratiÂ­
fled b each one of those States, with the exception of .MissisÂ­
..ippi, from whleh no official information has been received,
and in nearly all of them measures have been adopted, or are
now pending, to confer upon freedmen the privileges which
are essential to thmeir comfort, protection, and security. In
Florida and Texas the people are making commendahble proÂ­
gress in restoring their btate governments and no doubt is enÂ­
tertained that they will at an early period bo in a condition to
resume all of their practical relations with the General GovÂ­
ernment.
In ""that portion of the Union lately in rebellion,"" the aspect
of affairs is more promising than, in view of all the circum.
stances, could wall have been expocted. The people throughÂ­
out the entire South evince a laudable desire to renew their
allogianco to the Government, and to repair the devastations
of war by a prompt and cheerful return to peaceful pursuits,
and abiding faith is entertained that their actions will conÂ­
form to their professions, and that in acknowledging the
supreuac~ o o thie Constitution and laws of the Unite~ States


ear lorauty will Do unreservely given to too ioverrnment,
whose leniency they cannot fail to appreciate, and whose fosÂ­
tering care will soon restore them to a condition of prosperity.
It is true that in some of the States the demoralizing effects of
the waar are to be seen in occasional disorders; but these are
local in character, not frequent in occurrence, and are rapidly
disappearing as the authority of civil law is extended and susÂ­
taines. Perplexing quasotrs are naturally to be expected
from the great and uaniden abuge in ttoe relations between the
two races; but systems are gradeualy developinug themselves
under which the freedman will receiVr the protection to which
he is ljuastly entitled, and, by means of his labor, make himself
a useful and independent member in the community in which
he has a home.
From all the information in my possession, and from that
which I have recently derived from the most reliable authoriÂ­
ty, I am induced to cherish the belief that sectional animosity
is surely and rapidly merging itself into a spirit of nationalityÂ­
and that representation, connected with a properly-adjusted a
system of taxation, will result in a harmonious restoration of
the relation of the States to the National Union.

WAsnnoTONr, December 18, 1865,
t
Mr. COWAN then called for the reading of a report made to a
the President by General Grant concerning his late visit to the
South.
General Grant's report was read as follows :
HEADQUAnTERs ARMIES OF THE UNUTED STATEs,
WAsnmaxoso, D. C., December 18, 1865.
His Excellency A. Jo~hnon, residenlt of tle United State s:
Sin: In reply to your note of the 16tli instant requesting a i
report from me, giving such information as I may be possessed I
of, coming within the scope of the inquiries made by the SenÂ­ t
ate of the United States in their resolution of the 12th instant, a
I have the honor to submit the following: i
With your approval and also that of the honorable Secretary
of War, I left Washington city on the 27i of last month for 1
the purpose of maling a tour of inspectrio through some of
the Southern States, or States lately in rebellion, and to see t
what changes were necessary to be made in the disposition of
the military forces of the country, how these forces could be
reduced, and expenses curtailed, etc., and to learn as far as posÂ­ c
sible the feelings and intentions of the citizens of those States
towards the General GoVernment. The State of Virginia beÂ­ I
ng so accessiblo to Washington city, and information from
this quarter, therefore, being readily obtained, I hastened I
through the State without conversing or meeting with any of r
its citizens. In Raleigh, N'. C., I spent.one day; in Charleston, f
S. C.,two days; Savannah and Augusta, Georgia, each one I
day. Both in travelling and whilst stopping, I saw much and
conversed freely with the eitIzens of those States, as well as
with officers of the army who have been stationed among them. a
The fbllowng are the conclusions come to by me t a
I am satihedd that the mass of thinking men of the South
accept the present situation of affairs in good faith. The ques. f
tions which have heretofore divided the sentiments of the peeoÂ­ t
pie of the two sectlons-slavery and State rigbts-or the right c
of a State to secedefrm the Union--they regard as having
been settled fomrever by the highest trlhunal-arm-sthat man
can resort to. I was pleased to learn from the leading men
whom Imet that they not only accepted the decision arrived I
at as final, but that now the smoke ofl battle hs cleared away c
and time has been given for reflection, that this decision has I
been a fortunate one for the whole country, they reoeiving the i
like benefits form it with those who opposed' thm in the field I
and in the cuose.
Four yesrs of war, during which law was executed only at i
the point of the ayounet thronghot..the:States .in rebellion, t
have left the people, po.ably, In eotditlon not to yield that
zeadyobedlene ii civltor the Anerlcan poenople have I
enmy beenin the habit o yfeidin -This would render I
espresnce of nrgaro th hut thoeostatsanoe-. I




 sary until such time as labor retuorn tSalts aper channel and
civil authority is fully established I did not meet any one,
either those liolding places under the Governmment or citizens
of the Bouthern States, who think it practicable to withdraw
the military from the South at present. The white and the
black mutually require the protection of the General GovernÂ­
ment.
There is such univeraal acquiescence to the authority of the
General Government throughout the portions of the country
visited by me, thgt the mere presence of a military force,
without regard to numbers, is asfclent tomaintain order. The
good of the country, and economy, require that the force kept
in the interior where there are many freedmen (elsewhere, in
the Southern States, than at forts upon the sea-coast no force
is necessary) should all be white troops. The reasons for this
are obvious, without mentioning any of them. The presence
of black troops, lately slaves, demoralizes labor, both-by their
advice, and by furnishing in their camps a resort for the freedÂ­
men for long distances around. White troops generally excite
no opposition, and, therefore, a small number of them can
maintain order in a given district. Colored troops must be
kept in Jodies sufficient to defend themselves. It is not the
thinking men who would use violence towards any class of
troops sent among them by the General Government, but the
ignorant in some places might; and the late slave seems to be
imbued with the idea that the property of his late master
should by right belong to him-at least, should have no proÂ­
tection from the colored soldiers. There is danger of colliÂ­
elons being brought on by such causes.
My observations lead me to the conclusion that the citizens
of the Southern States are anxioas to return to self-government
within the Union as soon as possible; that whilst reconstructÂ­
ing, they want and require protection from the Government;
that they are in earnest In wishing to do what they think is
required by the Government-not humiliating to them as citiÂ­
zens-and that if such a course was pointed out, they would
pursue it in good-faith. It is to be regretted that there canÂ­
not be a greater commingling at this time between the citizens
of the two sections, and particularly of those entrusted with
the law-making power.
I did not gave the operations of the Freedmen's Bureau that
attention I would have done if more time had been at my disÂ­
posal. Conversationson the subject, however, with oflicerscon
nected with the Bureau, lead me to think that In some of the
States its affairs have not been conducted with good Judgment
or economy and that the belief, widely spread among the
freedmen of the Southern States, that the lands of their former
owners will at least in part be divided among them, has come
from the agents of this Bureau. This belief is seriously interÂ­
fering with the willingness of the freedmen to make contracts
for the coming year. In some form the Freedmen's Bureau is
an absolute necessity until civil law is established and enforced,
securing to the freedmen their rights and folkprotection. At
present, however, it is independent of the military establishÂ­
ment of the country, and seems to be operated by the different
agents of the Bureau according to their individual notions.
Everywhere General Howard, the able head of the BuÂ­
reau, made friends by the just and fair instructions
and advice he ""gave; but the complaint in South
Carolina was, that when he left things went on as before.
Many, perhaps the majority of the agents of the Freedmen's
Bureau, advise the freedmen that by their own industry they
must expect to live. To this end they endeavor to secure emÂ­
ployment for them, and to see that both contracting parties
comply with their engagements. In some instances, I am
sorry to say, the freedman's mind does not seem to be disaÂ­
bused of tito idea that the freedman has a right to live withÂ­
out care or provision for the future. The effect of the belief in
division of land is idleness and accumulation in camps towns,
and cities. In such cases I think it will be found that vice
and disease will tend to the extermination or great reduction
of the colored race. It cannot be expected that the opinions
held by men at the South for years can be changed in a day,
and therefore the freedmen require for a few years not only
laws to protect them, but the fostering care of those who will
give them good counsel and in whom they rely.
The Freedmen's Bureau, being separated from the military
establishment of the country, acquires all the expense of a
separate organization. One does not necessarily know what
the other is doing, or what order they are acting under. It
seems to me this could be corrected by regarding every.officer
on duty with troops in the Southern States as agents of the
Freedmen's Bureau, and then have all orders from the head of
the Bureau sent through department commanders. This would
create a responsibility that would secure uniformitr of action
throughout the South, would insure the orders anid instrucÂ­
tions from the head of the Bureau being carried out, and would
relieve from duty and pay a large number of employds of the
Government.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient ser.
v;mt, U. S. GRANT, Laeutenant Genera.
Mr. SUMNER. I wish to make one remark with reference

Mr. SUMNER. At any rate we can begin it. It is a very

the report was made of the condition of affairs in Kansas every
word was read at that desk. Now the question involved is
much more important. We have a message from the PresiÂ­
dent which is like the whitewashing message of Franklin
Pierce with regard to the atrocities in Kansas. I think the
Senate had better listen to the report of General Schurz on this
important subject.

BY THE SENATE. 52 TO 10.
All Foreigners Over Sixteen Years; of
Age Who Cannot lead and WVrite
to Be Denied Admiision.





WASHINGTON. Dec. 17.-The Senate toÂ­
day passed the immigration bill known as
the Lodge bill, with a new section plrovidÂ­
ing that the exclusion shall not apply to
persons arriving from Cuba during the conÂ­
tinuance of the present disorder's there.
The strength of the bill was greater than
had been expected, the final vote being 52
to 10. As passed, the bill amends the imÂ­
migration laws so as to exclude from adÂ­
mission to the United States all persons
over sixteen years of age who cannot read
and write tihe language of their native
country, or some other language, but an
admissible immigrant over the age of sixÂ­
teen may bring in with him, or send for,
his wife, or parent, or grandparent, or
minor child or grandchild, notwithstanding
the inability to read and write. For the
purpose of testing the ability of the immiÂ­
grant to read and write as required by the
foregoing section, the inspection officers
shall be furnished copies of the ConstituÂ­
tion of the United States printed on numÂ­
bered uniform pasteboard slips. each conÂ­
taining live lines of the Constitution
printed in the various languages of the imÂ­
migrants in double small pica type, These
slips shall be kept in boxes made for that
purpose atnd so constructed as to conceal
the slips from view, each box to contain
slips of libut one language and the imÂ­
migrant may designate the language in
which he prefers the test shall be made,
Each immigrant shall be required to draw
one of these slips from the box and read,
and afterwards write out in full view of
the immigration officers the five lines
printed thereon. Each slip shall be reÂ­
turned to the box immediately after the
test is linished and the contents of the box
shall be taken up by an inspection officer
before another drawing is made. No imÂ­
migrant failing to read and write out the
slip thus drawn by him shall be admitted,
but he shall be returned to the country
whence he came at the expense of the
steamshilp or railroad company which
brought him, as now provided by law.
The in'spection officers shall keep in each
box at all times a full number of these
printed pasteboard slips, and in the case
of each excluded immigrant shall keep a
certified memorandum of the number of
the slip which the immigrant failed to read
or copy out in writing.
The Cuban section added to the bill proÂ­
vides that the act shall not apply to perÂ­
sons arriving in the United States from
any port or place in the Island of Cuba
during the continuance of the present disÂ­
orders there, provided that such persons
have heretofore been inhabitants of that
island. An amendment by Mr. Elkins proÂ­
posing a $10 head tax on immigrants comÂ­
ing in other than American ships occaÂ­
sioned considerable debate and was linally
tabled, as was several other amendments.
The immigrant measure now goes into
conference, as the bill passed to-day is
a substitute for the Corliss-McCall bill
passed by the House.
At the opening of the session the House
amendments to the Senate bill, as to the
lands of the Atlantic & Pacilic Railroad
Company, were nonconcurred ill, and
Messrs. Hill, Platt and Clark named as
conferees.
UNFAIR ELECTION METHODS.
MIr. Chandler presented a large number
of petitions from Alabama reciting that
by reason of the electiont methods prevailÂ­

republican form of government at the presÂ­
ent time. It brought out a. statement from
Mr. Allen that the Alabama investigation
proposed by him had been defeated by ReÂ­
publican votes. MIr. Chlandler responded
that the defeat was due to 3Ir. Allen's misÂ­
management of his resolution and that the
Investigation could be resurrected.
Mr. Call offered a resolution, which was
referred, appropriating $10,001 as a relief
fund for the sutferers from the tidal wave
and storm which occurred on the Floridla
coast last October. A bill was passed auÂ­
thorizing the Kansas City, Shreveport &
Gulf Railroad to build a. bridge across the
Satbine river between Louisiana and Texas,
and another to authorize the readjustment
of accounts of army officers who were
graduates of West Point Military AcadÂ­
emy.
At 1 o'clock the immigration bill was
taken up, previous agreement having been
made that the final vote would occur at
4 p. m. Mr. Pasco secured a modification
of the Senate substitute so that the excluÂ­
sion will apply to ""all persons over fourÂ­

iu ilt fiance of the wisues and intentions of
tho voters of the State."" Assuming the
correctness of the statements iu this reportÂ­
ana they seen, to have been generally acÂ­
cepted by the countryâ€”the great crime in
Louisiana, about which so much has been
said, is th-t one is holding the office of
Governor who was cheated out of 20,000
votes, against another whose title to the
ctHci* is undoubtedly based on traud anil
iu defiance of the wishes and intentions of
the voters of the State.
Misinformed and misjudging a# to the
nature and extent of these reports, the supÂ­
porters of McEnery proceeded to displace
by force iu some counties ot tha State tho
ai-p datees ol ,'ae Governor, and on the
thirteenth of Apr::, in an effort of that
k,nd. a outchery ot citizens was committed
at Colfax, which, in bloodthirstiness and
barbarity, is hardly surpassed by any acts
of savage warfare.
To pat this matter beyond controversy. I
quote from tlic charge of Judge Woods, of
the Uuited States Circuit Court, to the jury
the case of the United States vs. CruikÂ­
sc..': . am. others, iu Now Orleans, in
March. <87 i. lie said in the case on trial:
""There are many facts in controversy. I
proceed to state some of them in the presÂ­
ence ar.d hearing ot counsel ou both sides,
and it I state as a conceded fact any matter
that is disputed they can correct me.""
AUer gi.ing the origin of the difficulty,
which gu .' out of an attempt of white perÂ­
sons to ur:ve tin* parish judge and sheriff,
appointees of Kellogg, from their offices,
and their attempted protection by colored
persons, which led to some lighting iu
which quite a number of negroes were
kt'led. the judge states: ""Most of those who
w.-re not killed were taken prisoners. Fif
teen or six*een of the blacks had lifted the
boards and taken refuge under the fioor
of the courthouse. They were all capÂ­
tured. About thirty-seven were taken prisÂ­
oners: the number'is not definitely fixed.
They were kept under guard until dark.
They were led' out two by two and shot.
Most ot them were shot to death; a few
were wounded, not mortally, and by preÂ­
tending to be dead were afterward, during
the night, able to make their escape. Among
them was the Levi XelsÂ«nÂ» named in the

HjdwtmaBt The dead bodieeof the negroes
10 a , fl * lr w L ere lef ' Â«HÂ»buried until
Tuesday, April lo, when they were buried
by a deputy marshal and an officer of the
militia from New Orleans. These persons
found htty-nme dead bodies. They
showed pistol shot wounds: the great
majority iu the head and most of them
in the back of the head. Iu addiÂ­
tion to the fifty-nine dead bodies
tound. some charred remain# of dead bodies
were discovered near the courthouse. S'x
dead bodies were foumi under a warehouse,
all shot iu the head, and but one or two
which were shot in the breast. The oniv
white tuen jr-jured from the beginning of
these troubles to their close, were Haihiot
and Harris, while the courthouse and its
contents were entirely consumed. There is
no evidence thet any one in the crowd of
whites bore any lawful warrant for the
arrest of one of the blacks. There is no
evidence that either Nash or Cazubat, after
the affair, had demanded their offices, to
which they had strong claim, but Register
coutinned to act as pavish judge, and Shaw
as shell ft.""
These are the facts in this ca -e, as I unÂ­
derstand them to be admitted. To hold the
people of Louisiana generally responsible
lor these atrocities would not be just; but
it is a lamentable fact that insuperable obÂ­
structions were thrown in the way of punÂ­
ishing these murderers, anil the so-called
Conservative papers of the State not only
justified the massacre, but denounced as
federal tyranny and despotism the attempt
of the United States officers to bring them
to justice. Fierce denunciations ring
through the country about the effect of
holding an election and matters iu LouisÂ­
iana, while every one of the Colfax misÂ­
creants goes imwhipped of justice, and no
way can be found in this boasted laud ot
civilization and Christianity to punish the
perpetrators o! this bloody and monstrous
crime.
Several Northern young men of capital
and enterprise had started the little aud
fiourishitig town of Coushatta. Some of
them were Republicans, and officeholders
under Kellogg. They were therefore
doomed to death. Six of them were seized
and carried away from tueir homes and
killed in cold blood. No one has been punÂ­
ished, and the Conservative press of the
State denounced all efforts to that end, aud
boldly justified the crime.
Many murders ot like character have
been committed, which can not here be deÂ­
tailed. For example: T. S. Crawtord,
judge, and F. II. Harris, district attorney
of the twelfth judicial district of the State,
on their way to court, were shot ftom their
horses by men iu auitiush, on the eighth of
October. 1873. and the widow of the luruier,
in a communication to the Department of
Justice, tells a piteous tale of the persecuÂ­
tion of her husband because he was a Union
man, and of the efforts made to screen those
who had committed a crime which, to use
her own language, ""Lett two widow# and
nine orphans desolate.""
To say that the murder of a negro or a
white Republican is not considered a crime
in Louisiana would probably be unjust to a
great part of the people: but it is true that
a great number of such murders have been
committed, aud no one has been punished
therefor, aud manifestly as to them the
spirit of hatred and violence is stronger
than the law.
Representations were made to tne that the
presence of troops in Louisiana was unÂ­
necessary aud irritating to the people, and
that there was no danger of public disturbÂ­
ance if they were taken away. ConseÂ­
quently early in last summer the troops
were all withdrawn from the State, with
the exception of a small garrison at the
New Orleans Barracks. It was claimed
that a comparative state of quiet had
supervened; political excitement as to
Louisiana affaire seemed to be dying
out. But the November election was apÂ­
proaching. and it was necessary for party
purposes that the ftauie should be rekindled.
Accordingly, on the fourteenth of SeptemÂ­
ber, D. B. Penn, claiming he was elected
Lieutenant Governor in 1872, issued an
inflammatory proelamation, calling upon
the militia of the State to arm. assemble,
and drive from power the usurpers, as ha
designated the officers of tho State. The
While Leagues, armed anil ready for the
coLtiict, promptly responded. On the same
day the Governor made a formal requisition
upon me pursuant to act of 1795, and secÂ­
tion four artiele four of the constitution, to
aid in suppressing domestic violence. On the
next day I issued my proclamation comÂ­
manding the insurgents to disperse within
five days iroui the date thereof; but before
the proclamation was published in New
Orleans the organized anil armed forces
recognizing a usurping Governor, had
taken forcible possession of the State
House aud temporarily subverted the
government. Twenty or more people were
killed, including a number of tlie policed'
the city. The streets of the city were
stained with blood. All that was desired in
the way of excitement had been accom*
plished.'and in view of the steps taken to
repress it, tlie revolution was apparently,
though it is believed, not really abandoned,
and the cry of federal usurpation and
tyranny in 'Louisiana was renewed with
redoubled energy. Troops had been sent to
the State under this requisition of the
Governor, and as other disturbances eeemed
imminent, they were allowed to remain
to render the executive such aid as might
become necessary to enforce the laws of the
State and repiess the continued violence
which seemed irresistible the moment fedÂ­
eral support should bo withdrawn.
Prior to anil with a view to the late elecÂ­
tion in Louisiana, tha white men banded
themselves together in armed bodies called
""White Leagues,"" and at the same time
threats were made in the Democratic jourÂ­
nals of the State that the election should be
carried against the Republicans at ail hazÂ­
ards, which very naturally greatly alarmed
the colored peojile. By section eight of the
act of February 18, 1871, it is made the duty
of United States marshals and their depuÂ­
ties at the polls w hero votes are cast for
representatives in Congress, to keep the
peace and prevent any violation of the so
called enforcement acts and other offenses
against the lawH of the United States, ami
upon requisition ot the marshal of Louisiana,
aud in view of 6Â»id armed organizations
and other portentous circumstances, I
caused detachments of troops to be stationed
in various localities in the State to aid him
in the performance of his official duties.
And that there was intimidation of RepubÂ­
lican voters at the election, notwithstandÂ­
ing these precautions, admits of no doubt.
The following are specimens of the means
used. Ou the fourteenth of t tetober eighty
persons signed and published the following
at Shreveport:
""We the undersigned merchants ol
Shreveport, in obedience to a request of the
Shreveport Campaign Club, agree to use
every endeavor to get our employes to vote
the People's ticket at the election, and in
tlie event ol their refusal to do so, or In
case they vote the Radical ticket, to refuse
to employ them at the expiration of their
present contracts.""
Dn tho same day other large bodies of
persons published in the same place a
paper in which they used this language:
""Wo the undersigned merchants of the
city of Shreveport, alive to the great iuiÂ­
importance of securing a good and honest
government to the State, do agree and
pledge ourselves not to advance supplies or
money to any planter in tho coming ; ar
who will give employment on his lauds to
laborers who vote the. Radical ticket in the
coming election.""
I have no information of the proceedings
of the Returning Board for said election
which may not he found in its report,
w liica has been published, but it is a matter
ot jiublic information that a great part of
the time taken to canvass the votes was
consumed by the arguments or lawyers,
several ot whom represented each party
before the board. I have_ no evidence that
the jiroceedings of this board were not in
accordance with the law under which they
acted. Whether, in excluding from their
count certain returns, they were right or
wrong is a question that depends ujion the
evidence they had before them, but it is
very clear that the law gives them the
power if ttiey choose to exercise it of decidÂ­
ing that way, and prirna facie the persons
whom they return as elected are entitled to
the offices for which they were candidates.
Respecting the alleged interference by
the military with the organization of the
Legislature* of Louisiana on the fourth inÂ­
stant, I have no knowledge or information
which has not been received by me since
that time and published. My first informaÂ­
tion was from the papers of the morning of
the fifth of January. I did not know that
any such thing waa anticipated, and no

orders nor suggestions were ever given to
any military officer in that State upon that
subject prior to the occurrence. I am well
aware that any military interference by the
officer# or troops of the United States with
the organization ot a State Legislature or
any of its proceedings, or with any civil
department of the government, is repugnant
to our ideas of government. I caa conceive
of no case, not involving rebellion or insurÂ­
rection. where such interference, by authorÂ­
ity of the general government, ought to be
permitted or justified. But there are circumÂ­
stances connected with the late- legislative
imbroglio in Louisiana which- seem to
exempt the military from any intentional
wrong in that matter. Knowing that they
had been placed iu Louisiana- to prevent
domestic violence and aid in tho enforceÂ­
ment of the laws, the officers and troops of
the United States army may well have
thought that it was their duty to act when
called upon by the government for that
purpose. Each branch of a Legislature is
thejuiigeot the election and qualifications
of its own members, but if a mob or a body
of unauthorized persons sei* and hold the
legislative hall in a tumultuous and riotous
manner, and so prevent aay organization
by those legally returned a# elected, it
might become tbe duty of the State execuÂ­
tive to interpose, if requested by a majority
of tlie members elect, to suppress tue disÂ­
turbances and enable the persons elected to
organize the House. Any exercise of this
power would only be justiciable under the
most extraordinary cireamstances, and it
would then be the duty of the Governor to
call upon the constabulary, or, if necessary,
the military force of the State. _
But with reference to Louisiana, it is to
Be borne ia mind that any attempt by the
Governor to use the police force of the
State at this time would have uudoubteiily
precipitated a bloody conflict with the
White League, as it did on the fourteenth
of September. There is no doubt but that
the presence of the United States troops
upon that occasion prevented bloodshed
and loss of life. Both parties appear to
have relied upon them as conservators of
the public peace. The tirst call was made
by the Democrats to remove persons ob
noxious to them from the legislative hall,
aud the second was from the Republicans
to remove persons who had usurped scats
iu the Legislature without legal certificates
authorizing them to seats, and iu sufficient
numbers to change the majority. Nobody
was disturbed by the military who had a
legal right at the time to occupy a seat in
the Legislature. That the Democratic miÂ­
nority of the House undertook to seize its orÂ­
ganization by fraud and violence; that in
this attempt they trampled under foot the
law: that they undertook to make persons
not returned as elected members, so as to
create a majority: that they, acting under
a preconcerted plan and under false preÂ­
tences, introduced into the ball a body of
men to support their pretensions by force,
if necessary, anil that conflict, disorder and
riotous proceedings followed, are facta that
seem to be well established, and I am inÂ­
formed that these violent proceedings were
part of a premeditated plan to have the
House organized in this way. recognize
what has been called the McEnery Senate,
then to depose Governor Kellogg, and so
revolutionize the State government.
Whether it was wrong for the Governor,
at the request of the majority of the memÂ­
bers returned as elected to the House, to
use such means as were in his power to
defeat these lawless and revolutionary proÂ­
ceedings, is, perhaps, a debatable question,
but it is quite certain that there would have
been no trouble if those who now complain
of illegal interference had allowed the
Uouse to be organized iu a lawful aud
regular manner. Where those who inauguÂ­
rate disorder and anarchy disavow those
who. by such means as they have, prevent
the success ot their lawless aud desperate
schemes.
Lieutenant General Sheridan was requestÂ­
ed by me to go to Louisiana to observe and
report the situation there, and, if in his
opinion necessary, to assume the command,
which be did on* the fourth instant, after
the Legislature disturbances had occurred,
at 9 1*. Jl., u number of hours after
the disturbances. No party motives
nor prejudices cau reasonably be imputed
to him, but honestly convinced by wiiat be
has seen and heard there he has characterÂ­
ized the leaders of White Leagues in severe
terms, anil suggested summary modes of
procedure against them, which, though
they can not be adopted, would, if legal,
soon put an end to the troubles aud disorÂ­
ders in that State.
General Sheridan was looking at facts,
nnd possibly not thinking of proceedings,
which would be the only proper ones to
pursue in time of peace, thought more of
tha utterly lawless condition of society
surrounding him at the time of his dispatch,
aud of what would be a sure remedy. He
never proposed to do an illegal act, nor exÂ­
pressed a determination to proceed beyond
what the law in the future might authorize
for the punishment oi the atrocities which
have been committed, anil tho commission
of which can not be successfully denied.
It is a deplorable fact that political crimes
and murders have been committed in LouÂ­
isiana which have gone unpunished, and
such have been justified or apologized for
which must rest as a reproach upon the
State and country long after the present
generation lias passed away.
I have no desire to have United State#
troous interfere in the domestic concerns of
ot Louisiana or any other State. On the
ninth of December last Governor Kellogg
telegrapned to me hi# apprehensions that
the White League intendi-d to make another
attack upon the State House, to which on
the same day I made the following answer,
since which no communication ha# been
sent to him: ""Your dispatch of this date
just received. It is exceedingly unpalatable
to use troops iu anticipation of danger. Let
the State authorities be right and then proÂ­
ceed with their duties without apprehension
of danger. If they are then molested, the
requisition will be determined whether the
United States is urahle to maintain law and
order within its limits, or not."" I have deÂ­
plored the necessity which seemed to make
it my duty under the constitution and laws
to direct such interference. I have always
refused, except where it seemed to be
my imperative duty to act in such a
manner under tlie constitution and tbe
laws of Congress. I have repeatedly and
earnestly entreated the people of the South
to iive together in peac- aud obey tbe laws,
and nothing would give me greater pleasure
than to see reconciliation and tranquillity
everywhere prevail, and thereby remove
all necessity for the presence of troops
among them. I regret, however, to say
that this state of things does not exist,
nor does its existence seem to bo desired
in some localities: and, as to those, it may
be proper for me to say that to the extent
that Congress has conferred power upon
me to prevent it. neither Ku Klux Klans,
White Leagues nor any other association
using arms and violence to execute their
unlawful purpose can be permitted ia that
way to govern any part oi this country.
Nor can I see with indifference Union
men or Republicans ostracised, persecuted
and murdered on account of their opinions,
a9 they are now in gome localities.
1 have heretofore urged the case of LouÂ­
isiana upon the attention of Congress, and
can not but think that its inaction has proÂ­
duced great evil. To summarize : In SepÂ­
tember last an organized body of men in
the support of candidates who had been
put in nomination for the offices of GovÂ­
ernor aud Lieutenant Governor at the NoÂ­
r-ember election in 1872. an-1 who hail been
declared not elected by tha board of canÂ­
vassers. recognized by all the courts to
which the question had been submitted, unÂ­
dertook to subvert and overthrow the State
government that had been recognized by
me in accordance with previous precedents.
Tlie recognized Governor was driven from
the Stab- House; and but for his finding
shelter in the United States Customhouse,
in the capita! of the State of which he was
Governor, it is scarcely to be doubted that
be would have been killed. From the S'ate
Honse, before he had been driven to the CusÂ­
tomhouse, a call was made in accordance
with the fourth section, fourth article of
the constitution of the United States, for
aid of the general government to suppress
domestic violence. Under these circumÂ­
stances and in accordance with my sworn
duties, my proclamation of the fifteenth of
September was issued. This served to
reinstate Governor Kellogg to his position,
but it can not be claimed that the insurgents
have to this day surrendered to the State
authorities the arms belonging to the State,
or that they have in any sense disarmed.
On the contrary, it iÂ» known that the same
armed organization that existed on tbe
fourteenth oi September, 1874, ffi opposition

to tbe recognized State government, still
retain its organization, equipments and
commandors, and can be called oat any
hour to resist the State government.
Under these circumstances the same miliÂ­
tary force has been continued in Louisiana
as was sent there under the first call and
under the same general instructions. I
repeat that the task ag^med by the troops
is uot a pleasant one tc vheui: that the army
is not composed of lawyers capable of judgÂ­
ing at a moment's notice of juat how tar
they can go in the maintenance ot law and
order, and that it was impossible to give
specific instruction providing for ail possible
contingencies that might arise. The troops
were bound to act upon the judgment of
the commanding officer upon each sudden
contingency that arose, or the instructions
whicli could only reach them after the
threatened wrongs had been committed
which tbev were called on to prevent.
It should be recollected, too. that upon
my recognition of the Kellogg I reported
the fact, with the grounds ot recognition, to
Congress, and asked that body to take
action in the matter; otherwise I should
regard their silence as acquiescence in my
course. No action has beea taken by that
body. If error ha# been committed by the
army m these matters it has always been
on tbe side of the preservation of good
order, the maintaining of law and the proÂ­
tection of life. Their bearing reflects credit
upon the soldiers, and if wrong has resulted,
the biame is with the turbulent element
supporting them. I earnestly ask that such
action be taken by Congress as to leave my
duties perfectly clear iu dealing with affairs
in Louisiana, giving assurance at the same
time tha' whatever may be done by that
body in the premises will be executed acÂ­
cording to the Bpirit and letter of the law,
without fear or favor.
I herewith transmit copies of documents
containing more specific information as to
the subject matter of the resolution.

A Letter tram Governor Kettogg,
Dated the nineteenth of August last, adÂ­
dressed to President Grant, at Long
Branch, in which Governor Kellogg reÂ­
grets to hare to trouble him again about
Louisiana affairs, but tbe exceptional cirÂ­
cumstances and the importance of the
issues involved render it necessary he
should make a brief statement of the
situation, which he proceeds to do, preÂ­
mising that Louisiana is now the last
State in the Southwest, except Mississippi,
that remains true to the Republican party.
He concludes by saying:
I respectfully anil earnestly suggest that
if United States troops were returned to
their posts in this State such a course would
have a most salutary effect and would preÂ­
vent much bloodshed, and probably a
formal call 'upon the President and a reÂ­
newed agitation of the Louisiana question
which otherwise a quiet, fair election next
November, -would forever set at rest and
fully vindicate your just policy toward us.

TexT-Who can find a virtuous woman?
for her price is far above rubies.-Solomon.
As virtuous women have in our days beÂ­
come as plenty as they were rare in the days
of Solomon, we can easily test the accuracy
of his description, detecting Iris inaccuracies,
and observing how they are intermin2led with
correct description, of which we subjoin the
following instances:
""She seeketh wool and flax, and worketh
willingly with her hands.""
Hired laborers are technically denominated
""hands,"" and so are the slaves on the other
side of the river. The inaccuracy in the above
account consists in the use of the term
""hands,"" for servants of both sexes, it being
generally confined to the males. The correct
portion of the description is, that the virtuous
woman is willing that her ""hands,"" or eer
vants, should do her work.
""She is like the merchant's ship-she
bringeth her food from afar.
This simile has generally been considered
very correct. Merchant ships usually carry
small burdens in proportion as they are swift
sailing and stylishly rigged; and the more
expensive and beautiful they are, the less
profitable are they. ""Her food is brought
from afar;"" that is to say, her tea comes
from China, .re sugar from the West Indies,




 and her olher luxuries from all parts of tile
world.
""She rises also while it is yet night, and
giveth meat to her household, and a portion
to her maidens.
There is a little incorrectness here, which
mtay, perhaps, be in the translation. 'rhe
true meaning of the verse probably is, that
the virtuous woman, when she gives a party,
sits up all night, and gives a supper to her
visitlrs, allowing her maidens to eat a portion
after them.
""She considereth a field and buyeth it;
with the fruit of Iher hands she planteth a vinÂ­
yard.""
'That is to say, the virtuous woman being
occasionally tired of town, persuades her husÂ­
band to buy a country seat, and by the labor
of her hired hands, to ornament it with ""vines
and fruit trees.""
""She girdeth herfloins with strength, and
strengtheneth her arms.""
This is strictly correct. The virtuous woÂ­
man requires a strong girdle around tier loins,
in order to make her waist as small as fashion
requires; and she must strengthen her arms
in order to draw hier girdle as tight as necesÂ­
sary.
""She perceiveth that ther merchandise is
good; her candle goethr not out by night.""
That is, when she goes a shopping, she
examines an immense quantity of goods, for
the purpose of being sure that they are of the
best quality, before she makes a purchase.
Her candle, of course, cannot go out by night
whether she gives a party or goes to one.
""She layeth her hands to the spindle, and
lher hands hold the distaff.""

 Interesting to - Housekeepers.
We find in "" Galignani's Messenger"" the
article of borax especially commended to
housekeepers as useful for many things. It
is said that the washer-women of Holland
and Belgium, so proverbially clean, and who
get up their linen so beautifully white, use
refined borax as - washing powder instead
of soda, and in the proportion of a large
handful of borax powder to about ten galÂ­
lons of boiling water; they save in soap
nearly half. All the large washing estabÂ­
lishments adopt the same mode. For-laces,
cambrics, &c., an extra quantity of powder
is used, and for crinolines, (required to be
made very stiff,) a strong solution is necessaÂ­
ry. Borax being a neutral salt, does not in
the slightest. degree injure the texture of the
linen; its cifect is to soitecn the hardest waÂ­
ter, and therefore it should be kept on every
toilet table. To the taste it is rather sweet,
and is used for cleaning the hair, is an exÂ­
cellent dentrifice, and in hot countries is used
in combination with tartaric acid and bicarÂ­
bonie of soda as a cooling beverage. Good
tea cannot be made with hard water; all
water may be made soft by adding a teaÂ­
spoonful of borax powder to an ordinary
sized kettle of water, in which it should
boil. The savinig in quantity of tea used
will at least one-fifth. To give black tea
the flavor of green tea, add a single leaf
from the black currant tree.

THE PRESIDENT
OF TTHE UNITED STATES.
' WASmINGTON, D. C., Dec. 4, 1871.
REVIEW OF THE YEAR.





To the Senate and House of Representatives: In
addressing my third annual Message to the lawÂ­
making branch of the Government, it is gratifyÂ­
ing to be able to state that during the past year
It
success has generally attended the efort to exeÂ­
cute all laws found upon the statute books. The
policy has been, not to inquire into' the wisdom
0lof the laws already enacted, but to learn their
spirit and intent, and to enforce themu accordingly.
The past year has, under a wise Providence,
S been one of general prosperity toi thb nation. It
has, however, been attended with mbre than usuÂ­
sual chastisement in the loss of life'nnd property
iby storm and fire. These disasters have. served
to call forth the best elements of human nature
in our country, and to develope a friendship for
us on the part of foreign ntitions which goes far
towards alleviating the distresses.ocassioned by
the elements. The benevolent, who hove so genÂ­
e orously shared their means with the victims of
e these misfortunes, will have their feward in the
consciousness of having performed a noble act,
sand in receiving the gratefill thankso' men, woÂ­
f men and children whose sufferings they have reÂ­
leived.
ATTITUDE TOWARD FOREIGN POvERS.
TilThe relations of the United States with foreign
f powers continue to be friendly. Thi year has
been an eventfiul one in witnessing twi great naÂ­
tions, speaking one language and havisg one linÂ­
cage, settling by peaceful arbitration disputes of
long standing, liable at any time to briny those
nations into bloody and hostile contflick -An exÂ­
o ample has been set, which, if succemsful in its
final issue, may be followed by other civilized naÂ­
tions, and be the means of finally returning to
productive industry millions of men pow mainÂ­
tained to settle the disputes of nati!lq by the
bayonet and the broadsword.
s THE TREATY OF WASHINGTON'
if
I transmit herewith a copy of the tre tyalluded
tb, which has been concluded since thl ~tdjournÂ­
ment of Congress, withll er BritanniMajesty,
and a copy of the protocols of the conferences of
n the Commissioners by whom it was egotiated.
The' treaty provides methods for ng the
questions iending between the two s; the
e various questions are to be adjuste yarbitraÂ­
tion.
I recommend Congress at an early day to make
the necessary provision for the tribunal at Geneva
and for the several commissions on the part of
n the United States called for by the treaty. His
d Majesty the King of Italy, the President of the
Swiss Confederation, and His Majesty the EmpeÂ­
Sror of Brazil, have consented, on the joint reÂ­
,n
quest of the two powers, to name an arbitrator
tbr the tribunal at Geneva. I have caused my
k thanks to be suitably expressed for the readiness
d with which the joint request has been.complied
with by the appointment of gentlemen of emiÂ­
r nence and learning to these important positions.
i His Majesty the Emperor of Germany has been
pleased to comply with the joint commission of
r.
the two Governments, and has consented to act
so
as the arbitrator of the disputed water-boundary
between the United States and Great Britain.
n The contracting parties in the Treaty have underÂ­
- taken to regard, as between themselves, certain
t principles of public law, for which they have conÂ­
tended from the commencement of their history.
- They have also agreed to bring these principles
to the knowledge of the other maratime powers,
. and to invite them to accede to them. NegotiaÂ­
y tions are going on as to the form of the note, by
which the invitation is to be extended to the othÂ­
er powers.
RELATIONS WsITH BRITISH NORTH AMERICA.
I recommend the legislation necessary on the
r.
part of the United States to bring into operation
the articles of the Treaty relating to the fisheries,
S and to other matters touching the relations of the
United States toward the British North American
possessions, to become operative as soon as the
e proper legislation should be had on the part of
Great Britain and its possessions.
It is much to be desired that this legislation
may become co-operative .before the fishermen of
the United States begin to make their arrangeÂ­
ments for the comning season.
CANAL AND RIVER NAVIGATION ON THE CANADIAN
-Â­ nonRDER.
I have addressed a communication, of which a
copy is transmitted herewith, to the Governors of
s,
New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, MichiÂ­
gan, Illinois and Wisconsin, urging upon the
Governments of those States respectively the
h necessary action on their part to carry into efebct
, the object of that article of the treaty which conÂ­
templates the use of the canals in either side conÂ­
, nected with the navigation of the lakes and rivÂ­
ers forming the boundary on terms of equity by
the inhabitants of both countries. It is hoped
- that the importance of the object and the benefits
. to flow therefrom will secure the speedy approval
and legislative sanction of the States concerned.
THE NORTHERN BOUNDARY.
I renew the recommendation for an appropriaÂ­
'e tion for determining the true position of the fortyÂ­
ninth parallel of latitude where it forms the beniss.
dary between the United States andJ'Ã½,g ns
Le
North American possessions, between the Lake
of the Woods and the summit of the Rcky
,Mountains. The early action o' Csdgrdse,'s
d this recommendation named, would put it in tle
t power of the War Department to place a force in
the field during the next summer.
p'OtfEcTION TO GERMANS IN FRAN$1,.
r The resumption of diplomatic relations between
France and Germany have enabled me to give
directions for the withdrawal of the protection
extended to Germans in France by the Diplomatic
e and Consular representatives of the United States
in that country. It is just to add that the deliÂ­
cate duty of this protection has been performed
d by the Minister and the Consul General at Paris
and the various Consuls in France under the suÂ­
n
pervision of the latter, with great kindness as
a well as with prudence and tact. This course has
received the commendation of the German GovÂ­
ernment and has wounded no siluceptibility of
the French.
RELATIONS WITH GERuANY.
h
The government of the Emperor of Germany
continues to mailfest a friendly feeling towards
the United States, and a desire to harmonize with
the moderate and just policy which this governÂ­
ment maintains in its relations with Asiatic powÂ­
ers as well as with the South American RepubÂ­
lies. I have given assurances that the friendly
feelings of that government are fully shared by
the United Staten.
NATURALIZATION TREATIES.
S The ratification of the Consularand NaturalizaÂ­
tion Conventions with the Austro-lungarian
Empire have been exchanged.
Y ITALIAN AFFAIRS.
I have been officially informed of the annexaÂ­
tion of the States of the Church to the Kingdom
of Italy, and the removal of the Capital ot that
hkingdom to Rome. Jp onformity with thet
f tablished policy'of thle United States I have recÂ­
ognized this change. The ratification df the new
d treaty of commerce between the United States
and Italy have been exchanged. The two powers
have agreed in this treaty that private property
Sat sea shall be eempt from capture, in case of
Swar between tthe two powers, The United States
have spared no opportunity of incorporating this
rule into the obliestions of nations.


CLAIMs AQAINST SPAIN.
The forty-first Congress, at its third session,
made an appropriation for the organization of a
mixed Commission for adjudicating upon claims
of citizens of the United States against Spain,
Sgrowing out of the insurrection in Cuba. Tlhrt
Commission has since been organized. I trans.
d mit herewith the correspondence relating to its
formation and its jurisdiction. It is to be hoped
that this Commission will afford the claimants a
complete remedy for their injuries.
SPAIN AND TIE SOPTIT AIMERICAN REPBILICS.
It has been the agreeable duty of the United
States to preside over a Conference at WashingÂ­
ton between the Plenipotentiaries of Spain and
t the allied South American Republics, which has
resulted in an armistice, with the reasons a
e
suruce of a permanent peace.
RUSSIA AND THE UNITED STATES.
SThe intimate friendly relations which have so
long existed between the united States and HIa,
sia continue undisturbed. The visit of thi tbird
son of the Emperor is a proof that there is po doÂ­
D
sire on the part of his government, to diminish
the cordiality of those relations. The hospitable
reception which has been given to the Grand
Duke is a proof that on our side, we share, the
wishes of that Government.
THE CASE OF M. CATACAZY.
The inexcusable course of the Russian MinisÂ­
s
ter at Washington renders it necessary to ask his I
a recall, and to decline to longer receive that funeÂ­ 1
tionary as diplomatic representative. It was imÂ­
- possible, with self respect, or with a just regard
a to the dignity of the country, to permit Mr. t'atÂ­
acazy to continue to hold intercourse with this
government, after his personal abuse of governÂ­
ment officials and during his persistent interferÂ­
ence, through various means, with the relations
between the United States and other powers. In
accordance with my wishes this government has
been relieved of further intercourse with Mr.
Catacazy, and thp irganagpment of the affairs of
the Imperial Legation has passed into the bands
of a gentleman entirely unobjeetionable.
INTERCORSE WITH JAPAN.
With Japan we continue to maintain intimate l
1
relations. The Cabinet of the Mikado has, since
the last session of Congress, selected citizens of f
the United Btates Cq sprye in oelices of importance
in several departments of that Governmemnt.
have reason to think that this selection is de to
an appreciation of the disinterestedness of the
policy which the United States have pursued toÂ­
wards Japan,
T TE COREN IMPFICpry ,
It is our desire to continue to maintain this e
disinterested and just policy with tbhina as well i
as Japan, The correspondence transmitted hereÂ­ t
with shows that there is* na disposition on the a
part of this Government to swerve from its estab, I
lieted course. prompted by a desire to put at i




 end to the barbarous tratment of our shipwreckÂ­
ed seamen on the Cordan coast, f instructed our
Minister at Pekin to eideavor to conclude a conÂ­
vention with Corea for Securing the safety and
humane treatment of such mariners. Admiral
Rodgers was instructed to accompany him with a
sufficient force to protect him in case of need. A
small surveying party.wassent out, and on reachÂ­
ing the coast was treacherously attacked at a
disadvantage. Ample opportunity was given for
an explanation and apology for the insult. NeithÂ­
er came. A force was then landed, and after an
arduous march over a rugged and difficult counÂ­
try, the forces from which the outrage had been
committed'were reduced by a gallant assault and
were destroyed. Having thus punished the crimÂ­
inals and havingvindicated the honlr of the flag,
the expedition returned, finding it impracticable,
under the circumstaneks, to conclude the desired
convention. I respectfully refer to the corresÂ­
pondence relating thereto herewith submitted,
and leave the subject for such action as Congress
may see fit to take.
OUR RELATIONS WITH MEXICO.
The Republic of Mexico has not yet repealed
the very objectionable laws establishing what is
known as the "" Free Zona,"" on the frontier of
the United States. It is hoped this may yet be
Sdone, and also that more stringent measures may
f be taken by that Republic for restraining lawless
persons on its frontiers. I hope that Mexico, by
its own good action, will soon relieve this GovÂ­
ernment of the difficulties experienced from these
causes.
SOUTH AMERICA. -
Our relations with the various republics of CenÂ­
tral and South America continue, with oneexcepÂ­
tion, to be cordial and friendly. 1 recommend
some action by Congress regarding the overdue
installments under the award of the Venzuela
Claims Commission of 1866. The internal disÂ­
sentions of that country present no justification
for the absence of an effort to meet their solemn
^
treaty obligatiois. The ratification of an extraÂ­
dition treaty with Nicaraguab hasbn exchanged.
ABOLITION OF SLAVERY"" Ir BRAZIL.
It is a subject for congratulation that the great
empire of Brazil has taken the initiatory steps toÂ­
ward the abolition of slavery. Our relations with
that empire, always cordial, wl u
n4urzu bhe
d made more so by this act. It'ie tit-M 'th to
hope that the Government of Brazil may hereafÂ­
ter find it fobr its interest as well as intrinsically
right to advance toward emancipation more rapÂ­
t.
idly than phe present act contemplates. The
e true prosperity and greatness of a nation is to
e be found in the elevation and education of its
laborers.
SLAVYE IN SPANISH W. INDIrs.
a It is a subject for regret that the reforms in this
f direction, which were voluntarily promised by
s the statesmen of Spain, have not been carried out
in its West India colonies. The laws and regulaÂ­
tions for the apparent abolition of slavery in Cuba
and Porto Rico leave most of the laborers in
or bondage, with no hope of release until their lives
y become a burden to their employers.
UNITED STATEr CITIZENS SLAVEHOLDERS IN OTHIIE
coUNTRIES.
I desire your attention to the fact that citizens
on f the United States, or persons claiming to be
citizens of the United States, are largely holders
in tbreign lands of this species of property, forÂ­
bidden the fundamental laws of their alleged
. country. I recommend to Congress to provide by
stringent legislation a suitable remedy against
the holding, owning or dealing in slaves, or beÂ­
m
ing interested in slave property in foreign lands,
either as owners, hirers or mortgagees, by citi
zens of the United States.
5, CUBAN AFFAIRS.
- It is to be regretted that the disturbed condi
fy tion of the Island of Cubacontinues to be a source
of annoyance and of anxiety. The existence of
protracted struggle in such close proximity to our
own territory, without any apparent prospect ol
an early termination, cannot be other than an oh
ject of concern to a people, who, while abstainÂ­
ing from interference in the affairs of other powÂ­
B ers, naturally desire to see every country in the
undisturbed enjoyment of peace, liberty and the
blessings of free institutions. Our naval comr
manders in Cuban waters have been instructed,
in case it should become necessary, to spare no
effort to protect the lives and property of bona
fide American citizens, and to maintain the dieg
nity of the flag. It is hoped that all pending
questions with Spain growing out of affairs in
Cuba may be adjusted in the spirit of peace and
N conciliation which has hitherto guided the tws
powers in their treatment of such question.
IEDUCATION OF AMERICAN YOUTH IN CHINA ANt
iJAPAN.
e To give importance and to add to the efficieney
,e
of our diplomatic relations with Japan and China,
t and to further aid in retaining the good opinioc
of those people, and to secure to the United
. States its share of the commerce destined to flow
between these nations and the balance of the comÂ­
mercial world, I earnestly recommend that an apÂ­
d propriation be made to support at least four
N American youths in each of those countries to
1i serve as a part of the official families of our MinÂ­
isters there. Our representatives would ndt even
then be placed upon an equality with the repreÂ­
sentatives of Great Britain and of some other
aÂ­
powers. As now situated, our representatives in
Japan and China have to depend for interpretors
Iand translators upon the natives of those counÂ­
f tries, who know our language imperfectly, or pro.
:e
cure for the occasion the servicesof employees in
y foreign business )houses, or the interpretors to
T6ther foreign Ministers.
n ID FOR CHINA AND Jl'APN.
1 would also recommend liberal measures for
the purpose of aiding the American lines of
steamers now plying between San Francisco and
n Japan and China and the Australian linesd, almost
'e our only remaining lines of ocean steamers, and
n of increasing their services.
TIHE NATIONAL DEBT
i"" has been reduced to the extent of $86,057,126 80
d during the year, and by the negotiation of nationÂ­
al bands at a lower rate of interest, the interest
on the public debt has been so far diminished that
a now the sum to be raised for the interest account
a is nearly $17,000,000 less than on the first of
March, 1809. It was highly desirable that this
If
rapid diminution should take place, both to
strengthen the credit of the country and to conÂ­
vince its citizens of their entire ability to meet
every dollar of the liability without bankrupting
ythem.
But in view of the accomplishment of
s these desirable ends, of the rapid developement
i of the resources of the country, its increasing
ability to meet the large demands, and the amount
already paid, it is not desirable that the present
Sresources of the country should continue to be
Staxed in order to continue this rapid payment.
TARIFF AND INTERNAL REVENUE 3iODIFICATIONS.
I therefore recommend a modification of both
the tariff and internal tax laws. I recommend
that all taxes from the internal service be abolÂ­
Sished, except those collected from sprituous,vinous
and malt liquors in their various forms, and from
stamps. In readjusting the tariff I suggest that
a careful estimate be made of the amount of surÂ­
Solus revenue collected under the ireosent nlawr. nt


ter providing for the current expenses of the
Government; that the interest account, and
the surplus fund, and the business surplus be reÂ­
diced in such a manner as offers the greatest
relief to the greatest number. There are many
articles not produced at home, btt which enter
largely into general consumption, through artiÂ­
cles which are manufactured at home, such as
medicines, etc., etc., from which very little reve,
n e is derived, but which enter into general use.
All such articles I recommend be placed on the
free list.
If a further reduction should prove advisable I
would then recommend that it be made upÂ­
a
on those articles which can best bear it without
a disturbing home production or reducing the waÂ­
, ges of American labor. 1 have not entered into
t
figures, because to do so would be to repeat what
will be laid before you in the report of the SecreÂ­
a tary of the Treasury.
dREVENUE LAWS.
a
The present laws for collecting the revenues,
pay collectors of customs small salaries, bqt proÂ­
vide for moieties and shares in all soeures, which
dat the principal ports of entry practically raise
the compensation of those officials to a large sum.
It has always seemed to me as if this system
must at times work perniciously. It holds out
an inducement to dishonest men, should such get
possession of these offices, to be lax in their scruÂ­
tiny of goods entered, to enable them finally to
make large seizures. Your attention is respectÂ­
fully invited to this subject.
THE QOLD pREMIUu .
The continued fluctuations in the value of gold
as compared with the national currency, has a
most dlangerous effect on the increase and develÂ­
opment of the country in keeping up the rices
of all articles neceasary in every day life. It fosÂ­
ters a spirit of gambling, prejudicial alike to naÂ­
tional morals and the national finances. If the
question can be met as to how to geta fixed value
to our currency, that value constantly and uniÂ­
Sfeformly approaching par with specie, a very desirÂ­
Sable object will be gained.
THE ARMY.
For the operations of the army in the past year,
the expense of maintaining the estimates for the
ensuing year and for continuing sea coast and
other improvements conducted under the superÂ­
vision of the War Department, I refer you to
the accompanying report of the Secretary of
War.
I call your attention to the provisions of the
act of Congress approved March 3, 1869, which
discontinues promotions in the Staff Corps of the
army until provided for by law. I recommend
that the number of officers in each grade of the
Staff Corps be fixed and that whenever the numÂ­
ber in any one grade falls below the number so
fixed, that the vacancy may be filled by promotion
from the grade below. I alsoi recommend that
when the office of chiefof a corps becomes vacant,
the place ,ay bp gllnet seleetiop from the corps
iq Whlrich Ph vacancy emtat.
THE NAVY.
The report of. the Socretary of the Navy shows
an improvement in the number and efficiency of
the naas force without material increase in the
I ensp of supporting it. That is due It the
polioy which has been adopted and is being exÂ­
tended as fast as our material will admit of using
Ialler vessels as cruisers on the several stations,
y this means we are enabled to occupy at ence a
larger etent of cruising ground to vist MaorF

 - frequently the ports where the presence of our i
r
fla is desirable, and generally to discharge.more I
- effiently the appropriate duties of the navy in I
I time of peace, without exceeding the number of
.I
men or the expenditures authorized by law.
NAVAL EXPLORATIONS.
During the past year the Navy has, in addiÂ­
a
tion to its regular service, supplied the men and
r officers for the vessels,of the coast survey, which
1Â­
completed the surveys authorized by Congress on
n
the Isthmus of Darien and Tehuantepee, and unÂ­
iÂ­
der like authority has sent out an expedition,
n
completely furnished and equipped, to explore
d the unknown ocean of the North.
iNCREASE AND IMPROVEMENTS OF THE NAVY.
' The suggestions of the report as to the necesÂ­
' sity for increasing and improving the material of
the navy, and the plan recommended for reducing
Sthe personnel of the service to a peace standard by
s
the gradual abolition of certain grades of officers,
thereduction of others, and the employment of
some in the commercial marine, are well considerÂ­
ed, and deserve the thoughtful attention of ConÂ­
d gress.
NAVAL PROMOTION.
o I also recommend that all promotions in the
Navy above the rank of Captain be by selection
y instead of by seniority. This course will secure
y in the higher grades greater efficiency, and hold
out an incentive to young officers to improve
e themselves in the knowledge of their prolession.
The present cost of maintaining the navy, its
cost compared with that of the preceding year,
aud the estimates iar tile ensuing year, are conÂ­
tained in the accompanying report of the SecretaÂ­
ry of the Navy.
THE POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT.
a The enlarged receipts of the Post Office DeÂ­
sÂ­ partment, as shown by the accompanying report
n of the Postmaster-General, exhibits a gratifying
n increase in that branch of the public service. It
IÂ­
is an index of the growth of education, and of
i. the prosperity of the people, two elements highly
conducive to the vigor and stability of republics,
with a vast territory like ours, much of it sparseÂ­
it ly populated, but all requiring the service of the
IÂ­ mail. It is not at present to be exoected that
h this department can be made self-sustaining, but
I -e
agradual approachtto this end, from year to year,
i is cotSfidettyelied n, and the day is not far
fÂ­ distant when the Post Office Department of the
ly Government ofill prove a much greater blessing
5 to the whole people than it is now. The suggesÂ­
ie tions of the Postmaster-GqtCral for improvements
0 in the Department presided over by him, are
ts
enarm tly recommended to your especial attention.
Espediallygo Irecommend a favorable corsideraÂ­
tion of the.plan for uniting the telegraph system
is of the United States with the postal system. It
is believed that by such a course the cost of teleÂ­
t graphing cduld be much reduced, and the service
as well, if not better rendered. It would secure
ia the further advantage of extending the telegraph
in through portions of the country where private
.s enterprise will not construct it. Commerce and
trade, arid above all the efforts to bring a people
widely separated into a community of interest,
at
are always benefitted by a rapid intercommunicaÂ­
tion. Education, the ground work of Republican
is institutions, is encouraged by increasing the faÂ­
se cilities to gather speedy news from all parts of
rs the country. The desire to reap the benefit of
rÂ­ such improvements will stimulate education. I
;d
refer you to the report of the Postmaster-General
Iy for full details of the operations of last year, and
ot for a comparative statement of the result of forÂ­
eÂ­ mer years.
THIE KU-KLUX UPRISING.
There has been imposed upon the executive
branches of the government the execution of the
act of Congress approved April 20, 1871, and
iÂ­ commonly known as the Ku-Klux law, in a porÂ­
te tion of the State of South Carolina. The necesÂ­
a sity of the course pursued will be demonstrated
ir by the report of the committee to investigate
of
Southern outrages. Under the provision of the
bÂ­ above act I issued a proclamation calling the atÂ­
nÂ­ tention of the people of the United States to the
v_ same, and declaring myreluctance to exercise any
se of the extraordinary power thereby conferred
ae
upon me, except in case of imperative necessity,
aÂ­ but making known my purpose to exercise such
d,
powers whenever it should become necessary to
Io
do so for the purpose of securing to all citizens of
ma the United States the peaceful enjoyment of the
rights guarantied to them by the Constitution
g and the laws.
n THE OUTRAES IN SOUTH CAROLINA.
After the passage of this law, information was
received from time to time, that combinations of
the character referred to in this law existed and
In
were powerful in. many parts of the Southern
States, particularly in certain limits of the State
of South Carolina. A careful investigation was
[, made and it was ascertained that in nine counties
in of that State such combinations were active and
.d
powerful, embracing a sufflicient portion of the
w citizens to control the local authority; the object
a.
being, among other things, to'deprive the emanÂ­
p.
cipated class of the substantial benefits of freeÂ­
ir dom, and preventing the free political action of
to those citizens who did not sympathize with their
IÂ­ own views. Among their operations were freÂ­
n quent scourgings and occassional assassinations,
e.
generally perpetrated at night by disguised perÂ­
or sons, the victims in almost all cases being citizens
in of different political sentiments friom their own,
rs freed persons, who had shown a disposition to
,. claim equal rights with other persons. ThouÂ­
. sands of inoffensive and well disposed citizens
n were the sufferers by this lawless violence.
o Thereupon, on the)lth of October, 1871, a pr.cÂ­
lamation was issued in the terms of the law callÂ­
ing upon the members of those combinations to
disperse within five days and to deliver to the
ir Marshal or military officers of'the United States
if all arms, ammunition, uniforms, disguises, and
d other means and implements used by them for
st carrying out their unlawlul purposes. This
d warning not having been heeded, on the 17th of
October another proclamation was issued susÂ­
pending the writ of habeas corpus in nine counÂ­
ties in the State. Direction was given that withÂ­
E0 in the counties so designated, persons supposed
mÂ­ upon respectable information to be members of
it such unlawful combination. should be arrested by
it the military forces of the United States and deÂ­
it livered to the Marshal, to be dealt with according
if to law. In two of said counties, York and SparÂ­
is tansburg, many arrests have been Ioade. At the
a last account the number of persons thus.arrested
were 168. Several hundred, whose criminality
t was ascertained to be of an inferior degree, were
g released for the present. These have generally
if made confessions of their guilt. Caution has
it been exercised in making these arrests, and notÂ­
g withstanding the large nimber, it is believed that
it no innocont person is now in custody. The prisÂ­
it oners will be heldlor regular trial in the judicial
a
tribunals of the United States. As it appeared
that the authorities of the United States were
about to take vigorous measures to enforce the
law, many persons absconded, and there is good
Sround fbr supposing that ali of such persons
d ave violated the law. A full report of what has
- been done under this law will be submitted to
Congress by the Attorney-General.
THE MORMON QUESTIONr,
In Utah there still remains a rewnant of barÂ­


iarism repugnant to civilization, to decency and
e
to the laws of the United States. Territorial ofÂ­
4 ficers, however, have been found who were wilÂ­
ling to perform their duty in a spirit of equity
it
and with a due sense of sustaining the majesty
y
of the law. Neither polygamy nor any other viÂ­
r olation of existing statutes will be permitted
- within the territory of the United States. It is
s not with the religion of the self-styled saints that
we are now dealing, but with their practices.Â­
They will be protected in the worship of God acÂ­
r cording to the dictates of their consciences, but
they will not be permitted to violate the laws unÂ­
I der the cloak of religion.
STATUS OF PLURAL WIVES AND THEIR CHILDREN.
It may be advisable for Congress to consider
o what, in the executionof thelawsagainst polygaÂ­
.t
my, is to be the status of plural wives and their
otffspring. The propriety of Cougress passing an
enabling act, authorizing the Territorial Le,sla.
ture of Utah to legitimatioe all children born
rior to a fixed time in the act, might be jiastified
by its humanity to these innocent children. This
is a suggestion only, and not a recommendation.
THE INDIANS.
The policy pursued towards the Indians has reÂ­
a
sulted favorably, so far as can be judged from the
t limited time duaring which it has been in operaÂ­
t tion. Through the exertions of the various soÂ­
cieties of Christians, to whom has been entrusted
0 the execution of the polioy, and the Board of
Commissioners autllored by the law of April
i0, 1860, many tribes of Indians have been inÂ­
duced to settle upon reservations, to cultivate the
soil, to perform productive labor of various kinds,
and to partially accept civilization. They are beÂ­
ing kindly cared for in such a way that it is
hoped to induce those still pursuing their old
habits of life to embrace the only opportunity
which is left them to avoid extermination. IrecÂ­
- ommend liberal appropriations to carry out the
INDIAN PEACE POLICY,
Notonly because it is humane, Christianlike
and economical, but because it is right. I reÂ­
commend tq yopr favor ble consideration, also, t
the policy of granting a territorial government to
the Indians in the Indian Territory west of ArÂ­ I
akansas and Missouri, and south of Kansas. In
1
doing so, every right guaranteed to the Indians
by treaty should be secured. Such a course might t
in time be the means of collecting most of the I
f
Indians between the Missouri and the Pacific,
and of the British Possessions, into one TerritoÂ­
ry or one State., The Secretary of the Interior
has treated upop thji subject at length, and
Corgmend to you his suggestions. t
THE PunIc LANDS.
I renew my recommendation that the public
e
hinds be regarded as a heritage to our children to
be disposedof only as required for occupation and
to actual settlers, Those already granted have b
begn In great part disposed of in such a way
as to secure access to the balance by the i
hardy settler who may wish to avail himself f
of them, but caution should be exercised even
In attaining so great an advantage. The eduÂ­ ii
cational interest may then be served by the n
grant of poeds of.sale of public lands to setÂ­
ters, I do not wish to be understood as recomÂ­
mending In the least degreen curtailment of what
is being done by the general covernment for the
encouragement of education. The report of the b
Secretary of the Interior, submitted with this, g
will give you all the information collected and
prepIsedlor publloation in %aid to the uensuot.a




 taken during the year. 1870, the operation of the
Bureau of Education for the year, the Patent OfÂ­
flee, the Pension Office, the Land Office and the
Bureau.
THE AGRICULTURAL INTERESTS.
The report of the Commissioner of Agriculture I
gives the operations of his department for the
year. As agriculture is the groundwork of our
prosperity, too much importance cannot be atÂ­
tached to the labors of this department. It is in
the hands of an able head with able assistants, all
zealously devoted to introducing into the agriculÂ­
tural productions of the nation nll useful proÂ­
ducts adapted to any of the various climates and b
soils of our vast territory, and to giving all useÂ­
ful information as to the methodof cultivation.
With the plants, cereals and other products
adapted to particolar localities, quietly but surely c
the Agricultural Bureau is working a great naÂ­
tional good, and if liberally supported, the more
widely its influence will be extended, and the less
dependent we shall be upon the products of forÂ­ e
eign countries.
OFFICIAL SALARIES. f
The subject of compensation to the heads of I
bureaus and officials holding positions of responÂ­ I
sibility requiring ability and character to fill I
properly, is one to which your attention is inviÂ­
ted. But few officials receive a compensation
equal to the respectable support of a family, s
while their duties are such as to involve millions
of interest. In private life services demand comÂ­
pensation equal to the services rendered. A wise
economy would dictate the same rule in the GovÂ­
ernment service.
CURRENT EXPENSES.
I have not given the estimates for the support 1
of the Government for the ensuing year, nor the
comparative statement between the expenditures
for the year just passed and the one just precedÂ­
ing, because all these figures are contained in the
accompanying reports, or in those presented diÂ­
rectly to Congress. These estimates have my
approval.
THE AMNESTY QUESTION.
1More than six years having elapsed since the
last hostile gun was fired between the armies
then arrayed against each other, one for the perÂ­
petuation and the other for the destruction of the
Union, it may well be considered whether it is
not now time that the disa bilities imposed by the
14th Amendment should be removed; that
amendment does not exclude the ballot, but only
imposes the disability to hold office upon certain
classes. When the purity of the ballot is secure,
the majorities are sure to elect officers reflectinr
the views of the majority. I do not see the adÂ­
vantage or propriety of excluding men from office
merely because they were before the rebellion of
a character sufficient to be elected to a position
requiring them to take oaths to support the conÂ­
stitution, and admitting to eligibility those enterÂ­
taining precisely the same views, but of less
standing in their communities. It may be said
that the former violated an oath while the latter
did not. The latter did not have itin their power
to do so. If they had taken this oath it cannot
be doubted they would have broken it, as did the
former class. If there are any great criminals
distinguished above all others for the part they
took in opposition to the Government, they might,
in the judgment of Congress, be excluded from
such an amnesty. This subject is submitted for
your careful consideration. The condition of the
1 Southern States is, unhappily, not such as all true,
patriotic citizens would like to see. SocialostraÂ­
cism, for opinion's sake, personal violence or
threats towards persons entertaining political
views opposed to those entertained by the majorÂ­
ity of the old citizens, prevents immigration and
the flow of much needed capital into the States
I lately in rebellion. It will be a happy. condition -
of the country when the old citizens of the States
will take an interest in public affairs, promulgate
ideas honestly entertained, vote for men represenÂ­
ting their views, and to concede the same freedom
of expression and ballot to those entertaining
diflbrent political convictions.
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
Under the provisions of the act of Congress,
approved February 21, 1871, a Territorial GovÂ­
ernment was organized in the District of ColumÂ­
bia. Its results have thus far fully realized the
f expectations of its advocates. Under the direcÂ­
tion of the Territorial officers, a system of imÂ­
provements has been inaugurated, by means of
which Washington is rapidly becoming a city
worthy of the nation's capital, the citizens of the
District having voluntarily taxed themselves to a
large amount for the purpose of contributing to
the seat of Government. I recommend liberal
appropriations on the part of Congress, in order
that the Government may bear its just share of
the expense of carrying out a judicious system of
improvement.
GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS IN CHICAGO.
By the great fire in Chicago the government
buildings were consumed. Those burned had alÂ­
ready become inadequate to the wants of the govÂ­
ermnent in that growing city, and looking to the
near future were totally inadequate. 1 recomÂ­
mend therefore that an appropriation be made
immediately to purchase the remainder of the
square in which the burned buildings stood, proÂ­
vided it can be purchased at a fair valuation, or
provided that the Legislature of Illinois will pass
a law authorizing its condemnation for GovernÂ­
ment purposes, and also an appropriation of as
much money as can properly be expended toward
the erection of a new building during the fiscal
year.
PROTELTION OF IMMIGRANTS.
The number of immigrants ignorant of our
laws, habits, &c., coming into our country annuÂ­
ally, hasbecome so great, and the impositions
practiced upon them so numerous and flagrant,
that I suggest Congressional action for their proÂ­
tection. It seems to me a fair subject of legislaÂ­
tion by Congress.
I cannot now state fully as I desire the nature
of the complaints made by emigrants of the
treatment they receive, but will endeavor to do
so during the session of Congress, particularly if
the subject should receive your attention.
CIVIL SERVICE REFORM.
It has been the aim of the Administration to
enforce honesty and efficiency in all public offices.
Every public servant who has violated the trust
placed in him has been proceeded against with
all the rigor of the law. If bad men havesecurÂ­
ed places, it has been the fault of the system
established by law and custom for making apÂ­
pointments, or the ftult of those who recommend
for government positions persons not sufficiently
known to them personally, or who give letters enÂ­
dorsing the character of office seekers without a
proper sense of the grave responsibility which
such a course devolves upon them. A civil serÂ­
vice reform whichl can correct this abuse is much
desired. In mercantile pursuits, the business
man who gives a letter of recommendation to a
frieud to enable him to obtain credit from a
stranger is regarded as morally responsible for
the integrity of his friend, and his ability to meet
his ohligations. A reformatory law which would
onforco this principle against all indorsers of perÂ­
sons for public place would insure great caution
in making recommendations. A salutatory lesÂ­
son has been taught the careless and dishonest


Puv r .Â­ .u r csc s plrlsoeuÂ­
tions and convictions of the last two years.
PUNISHIIENT OF OFFENDERS.
It is gratifying to notice the favorable change
which is taking place throughout the country in
bringing to punishment those who have proven
recreant to the trusts conferred, and in elevating
to public office none but those who possess the conÂ­
fidence of the honest and virtuous, who, it Will
always be found, comprise the majority of the
community in which they live.
THE CIVIL SERVICE COMMiISSON.
In my message to Congress one year ago I urÂ­
gently recommended a reform in the civil service
of the country. In conformity with that recomÂ­
mendation, Congress, in the ninth section of an
act making appropriation for sundry civil expenÂ­
ses of the Government, and for other purposes,
approved March 3, 1871, gave the necessary auÂ­
thority to the Executive to inaugurate a civil
service reform, and placed upon him the responsiÂ­
bility of doing so. Under the authority of said
act, I convened a board of gentlemen eminently
qualified for the work, to devise rules and reguÂ­ I
lations to effect the needed relorm. Their labors
are not yet complete, but it is believed that they
will succeed in devising a plan which can be
adopted, to the great relief of the Executive, the I
Departments and members of Congress, and t
which will redound to the true interests of the
public service. At all events, the experiment
shall have a fair trial.
CONCLrSION.
I have thus hastily summed up the operations
of the Government during the last year, and
made such sugoestionsas occur to me to be proper
for your consideration. I submit them with a
confidence that your combined action will be wise,
statesmanlike, and in the best interests of the c
whole country.

)nÂ­ It iS but natural that the majority of Sufferers from
reÂ­ Asthma. after trying doctors and numberless remedies
he without avail, have come to the conclusion that there
es, is no cure for this most distressing disease. These
he same persons may still have doubt when they learn
9sr through the oolumns of ihe press that Dr. Rudolph
ory Rabiffmann, the recognised authority who has treated
he more cases of Asthma than any living doctor, has at
ng last achieved success. He has perfected a remedy
1g which not only gives immediate relief in the worst
cn-ases, but has positively cured thousands of sufferers
es who were considered incurable. These persons bad
ce previously been just as sceptical as some of our readers
he are now. Dr.Schiffmnnn'lsremedy doubtlesspossesses
of the merit which is claimed for it, or he would not
re extend an invitation to every sufferer to make a
he personal test of it. He authorises this paper to
lot announce that he is not only willing to give free to I
of any person suffering from Asthma, Hay-Fevor, or
t8 Bronchitis in this Town. one free liberal "" trial box"" of
2d his Cure, but urgently requests all sufferers to call at

fia box absolutely free of charge (only on condition that

nÂ­ fears that in making the claim he does for his Cure a
ln strong doubt may arise in the minds of many, and t
1e knows that a personal test, as he offers to all, will be
It more convincing, and prove its merits, than thousands
te of Testimonials which he could publish from persons
s who have been permanently cured by the use of his
h
Asthma Cure. ""Dr. R. Schiffmanns Asthma Cure,'
0 as it is called, has been sold by chemists

The appearance of the President was greetÂ­
ed with enthusiastic cheers and with bursts
of music from the bands of all the various
civic and military organizations which were
drawn up in line of battle and filled the wide
space in front and extending the entire length
of the Capitol.
'IIIt: OATH ADMINISTEIREDtII-ENTHUlASTIC
PLAUDITS FROM TIIE MULTITUDrE.
The noise of greeting was hushed as the
President-elect and Chief Justice of the UniÂ­
ted States rose simultaneously and the latter
commenced to recite the formula of the PresiÂ­
dential oath of office, which President Grant
toik with head uncovered and resumed his
seat for a few moments, while the boom of
cannon, the ringing of bells and the shouts
of the vast multitudes burst forth with deafÂ­
ening sound. and cheer after cheer went up
with a volume of tone which almost rendered
inaudible the reports of the cannon. Partial
quiet having been restored, the Presidentt
arose and proceeded to read
TIE INAUGURAL ADDRESS.
INTRIODUCTORY-I.ECONSTUCTION.
Fi'll ow Citizen.s: -Under Providence, I have
been sailed a seconl titue to act as Executive
over this great nation. It has been tmy eaÂ­
deavor In the past to maintain all the laws
and so far as lay ill my power to act for the
best interests of the whole people. My best
tffoirts will be given in the same direction inl
tlhi future, aitled, I trust, by my four years'
xperitence in the office. When my tirst term
of the olli:e of Chief Executive began, the
eountry haisd not recovered fromn the etfeets of
Sgreatt internal revolltion, and three of the
ititrer States of the Union had not been re.
,tored to teir Federal relations. It seemed
to site wise that no questions should be raised
so long as that condition of allairs existed;
therefore the past fousr years, so far as I could
control events, have been consusmed its the
etflrt to restore harmony, public credit, comÂ­
mei ce and all the arts of peace and progress.
GOVEIRNMENT BY THE PEOPLE.
It is my firm conviction that the civilized
world is tending towards tRepublicanism, or
Government by the people through their
clihosen Representatives, and that our own
great Republic is designed to be the guiding
star to all others. Under our Republic we
support an army less than that of any EuroÂ­
pean power of any standing, and a navy less
than that of either of at least five of them.
l'here could be no extension of territory on
this continent which would call for an inÂ­
crease of this force, but rather might such
extension enable us to diminish it. The
theory of government changes with the genÂ­
eral progress. Now that the telegraph i5
made available for communicating thought,
tigether with the rapid transit by steamer,
all parts of the continent are made contiguÂ­
ous for all purposes of g vernment, and corÂ­
munication between the extreme limits of
the country is made easier than it was
throughout the old thirteen States at the beÂ­
ginnsing of our natiOilal existence.
IIGIITS OF THE COLORISED ACE.
Tie elfects of the late civil strife have been
to free the slave and make him a citizen, yet
le is not possessed of the civil rights which
citizenship should carry with it. 'This is
tprong and should be corrected. To this corÂ­
retiorn I stand committed so far as Executive
influence can avail. Social equality is not a
-utbject to be legislated upon, nor shall I ask
that anything be doine to advance the social
status of the colored tnan, except to give him
a fair chalca to develop what there is o: good
iii hlis. CGive h!m access to schools and
whets he travels, let him feel assured that his
conduct will regulate the tretimenit and fare
he will receive.
THE UNION RIESTOI.ED.
The States lately at war with the General
Government are now happily rehabilitated
and no Executive control is exercised in any
one of therm, that would not be exercised in
any other State under like circumstances.
SAN DOMINGO.
Its the firet year of the past a-dministration
the proposition cmrse up for the admission of
Sanut Domingo as a territory in the Union. It
was not a question of my seeking, but was a
proposition from the people of Santo DL)nirÂ­
go and which I entertained. I believe now,
as I did then, that it was for the best interÂ­
eats of this country, for the people of Santo
Domisngo and all concerned, that tile proposiÂ­
tion should be received favorably. It was,
however, rejected constitutionally, anld thereÂ­
fore the subject was never brought up again
by rie.
AICQUIITISTON O' TEIRIIOITORY-TttIt FUTUIRE:
GOLDEN AGE.
It fitture, while I hold my present otlice,
the suibiect of the acquisition of territory
must have the support of the people betfore I
will recormriend any proposition looking to
such acquisition. I say here, however, that I
do not share in the apprehension held by
many as to the danger oft the Government
beolitis g weakened and destroy ed by reason
ot the extension of territory. Cornterce,
edlcteatiorn alid rapid transit of thouthtt and
matter by telegraph and steam, have changed
all this. Rather do I believe that ouilr Great


Mirer is preparing roe worluin ime own good
nine, to becomn one nation, spasking une
language, when armies and navies will bU no
]onger required.
TIlE POLICY OF THE ENSUINGi A.DMINISTIR1Â­
TICN,
My efforts in the future will be directed to
the restoration of good feeling between the
dilferent sections of our comnnion country; to
the restoration of our currency to a fixed
value as compared with the world's standard
of values, gold, and if possible to par with it;
to the construction of cheap routes of transit
throughout the land, that the products of all
sectiuons may find a market and have a living
remuneration to the producer; to the mainÂ­
tenance of friendly relations with all our
neighbors and with distant nations; to the
reestablishment of our commerce and a share
ill the carrying trade upon the ocean; to the
encouragement of such manufacturing inÂ­
dustries as can be economically pursued in
this country, to the ends that the exports of
bone products and Industries may pay for
our imports-the only sure method ot returnÂ­
ing to and i:ermanently maintaining a specie
basis; to the elevation of labor and by a
humane course to bring the Aborgines of the
country tundler the benign influences of eduÂ­
cation and civilization.
A CII.IISTIAN POLICY TOWAIRD TUIE INDIANS.
it is either this or a war of extermiuation.
Wars of extermination engaged in by a peoÂ­
ple pursuing commerce and all the industrial
pursuits are expensive even against the
weakest people and are demoralizing and
wicked. Our superiority of strength and adÂ­
vantages of civilization should make us
lenient towards the Indians. The wrong
already inflicted upon them should be taken
into account and the balance placed to their
credit. The moral view of the subject should
be considered and the question asked, ""CanÂ­
not the Indian be made a useful and proÂ­
ductive member of society by proper teachÂ­
ing and treatment ?"" If the effort is made in
good faith we will stand approved before the
civilized nations of the earth in our own
consciences for having made it;
APPEAL TO TIIE PEOPLE FOR SUPPORT.
All these things are not to be accomplishÂ­
ed by one individual; but they will receive
my support and such recommendations to
Congress as will in my judgment best serve
to carry them into effect. I beg your support
and encouragement.
CIVIL SERVICE REFORM.
It has been, and is, my earnest desire to
correct abuses that have grown up in the civil
service of the country. To secure this reÂ­
formation, rules regulating the method of
appointment and promotion were established
and have been tried. My efforts for such reÂ­
formation shall be continued, and to the best
of my judgment the spirit of the rules will be
maintained.
ACKtOWLEnDGoMENT AND PaEDGO OF
FIDELITY.
I acknowledge before this assemblage,
representing as it does every section of our
country, the obligation I am under to my
countrymen for the great honor they have
conferred on me by returning me to the highÂ­
est office within their gift, and the further
obligation resting on me to render them the
best service which is in my power.
TWELVE YEARS OF CONSTANST RESÂ­
PONSIBILITY.
This I promise, looking forward with the
greatest anxiety to the day when I shall be
relieved from responsibilities that at times are
almost overwhelming and from which I have
scarcely had a respite since the eventful firing
upot Fort Sumter, in April, 1801, to the present
day. My services were then tendered and
accepted under the first call for troops growÂ­

 ing out of that event. I did not ask for place 4
or position and was entirely without inÂ­
fluence, or the acquaintance of persons of inÂ­
fluence; but was resolved to perform my part
in a struggle threatening the very existence
of the nation.
TIlE TOTRRENT OF ASPERSION-TIIE PEOÂ­
PLE'S VERIDICT A GRATEFUL VINDICAÂ­
TION.
I performed my conscientious duty without
asking promotion or command, and without
a revengeful feeling towards any section or
individual. Notwithstanding this, throughÂ­
out the war and from my candidacy for my
present office in 1868 to the close of the last
Presidential campaign, I have been the subÂ­
ject of abuse and slander scarcely everequallÂ­
ed in political history, which to-day I feel
that I can afford to disregard in view of your
verdict, which I gratefully accept as my vinÂ­
dication.
The President's voice was inaudible except
to persons on or near the platform and conÂ­
sequently there was no manifestation of apÂ­
plause or otherwise by the multitude during
its delivery, which occupied less than ten
minutes, and was completed before a large
part of the assemblage who were out of the
range of view thought it had begun.
RETURN TO TUIE WHITE IIOUSE.
At the conclusion of the address the PresiÂ­
dent was warmly.congratulated by his friends,
and soon after left in his carriage for the
White House escorted by the procession
which had formed and taken up the line of
march. Most of the outside crowd followed
in the same direction, and the rest dispersed
to their homes while the Senate returned to
its Chamber and the inaugural ceremonies at
the Canitol were concluded.
A GRAND REVIEW.
After the inauguration President Grant, toÂ­
gether with Secretaries Robeson and Belknap,
Generals Sherman and Sheridan and their
families, reviewed the military procession
from a platform on Pennsylvania Avenue.
Immediately in front of the White House,
on Pennsylvania Aveune, a large covered
platform had been erected, from which the
President was to review the Military. This
stand was decorated with flags and streamers
and inside it was handsomely upholstered,
and contained seats for the Presidential
party. Mrs. Grant and Miss Nellie Grant, as
also Mrs. Gen. Dent, Mrs. Marshal Sharpe
and other ladies connected with the PresiÂ­
dent's family came in carriages directly from
the Capitol and occupied seats with the rest
of the party on the stand. An immense
crowd had gathered in the vicinity and lingerÂ­
ed in the intense cold weather for the coming
of the military. The review was by far the
most imposing portion of the display, and
more than an hour was consumed in passing
the President.

A poorer stand even than that in their first was made by the Lancashire men in the second innings, and they were all out in 45 minutes from the starting of play for the trifle of 28 runs, leaving the Australians victors by 217 runs. The wicket was heavy, and on it McKibbin was very effective, getting no less than seven wickets to his credit for 11 runs. He got on a marvellous break both ways that quite puzzled the batsmen, and his work of destruction was accomplished with but 58 balls. Trumble's two wickets cost a dozen runs. Kelly was in first-class form behind the wickets, and stumped three men and caught another. The half-dozen runs made by Abel on Friday evening remained the largest individual score for the innings, while three players were got rid of before they had broken their "" duck."" Sugg, who remained not out on the drawing of stumps the previous day, was disposed of by the first ball from McKibbin. McLaren was get rid, of when the score stood at 12, and Tyldesley at 18.

FellowÂ­ Ciut:ens of thre Senate
and House of Representatives:





T'hroughout the year, since our last meeting,
the country hats been eminently prosperous in all
its niraterial interests. tThe general health has
been excellent; our harvests have been abundant,
and plenty smiles throughout the land. Our com.
mercy and manufactures have been prosecuted
with energy and industry, and have yielded fair
and ample returns. In short, no nation in the
tide of time has ever presented a spectacle of greatÂ­
er material prosperity than we have done until
within a very recent period.
Why is it, then, that discontent now so extenÂ­
sively prevails, and the Union of the States,which
is the source .of all these blessings, is threatÂ­
ened with destruction ? The long continued and
temperate interference of the Northern people
with the question of slavery in the Southern
States. has at length produced its natural effects.
The different sections of the Union are now arÂ­
rayed against each other, and the time has arrived,
so much dreaded by the Father of His Country,
when hostile geographical parties havebeen formÂ­
ed. I have long foreseen and often forewarned
my countrymen of the now impending danger.Â­
This does not proceed solely from the claim on the
part of Congress or the Territorial Legislatures
to exclude slavery from the Territories, nor from
the efforts of different States to defeat the execuÂ­
tion of the Fugitive Slave law. All or any of
these evils might have been endured by the South
without,danger to the Union, (as others have been,)
in the hope that time and reflection might apply
the remedy. The immediate peril arises not so
much from these causes as from the fact that the
incessant and violent agitationr of the slavery
question throughout the North for the last quarÂ­
ter of a century, has at length produced its malign
influence on the slaves, and inspired them with
vaeue notions of freedom. Hence a sense of seÂ­
curity no longer exists around the family altar.Â­
This feeling of peace at homo has given place to
apprehensions of servile insurrection. Many a
matron throughout the South retires at night in
dread of what may befall herself and her children
before the morning. Should this apprehension of
domestic danger, whether real or imaginary, exÂ­
tend and intensify itself until it shall pervade the
masses of the Southern people, then disunion will
become inevitable. Self-preservation is the first
law of nature, and has been implanted in the
heart of man by his Creator for the wisest purÂ­
pose; and no political union, however fraught
with blessings and benefits in all other respects,
can long continue, if the necessary consequence
be to render the homes and the firesides of nearÂ­
ly half the parties to it habitually and hopelessly
insecure. Sooner or later the bohds of such a
Union must be severed. It is my conviction
that this fatal period hais not yet arrived; and
my prayer to God is that He would preserve
the Constitution and the Union throughout all
generations.
But let us take warning in time, and remove
the cause of danger. It cannot be denied that,
for five and twenty years, the agitation at the
North against slavery in the South has been inÂ­
cessant. In 1835, pictorial hand-bills and inflamÂ­
atory appeals were circulatedextensively throughÂ­
out the South, of a character:;to excite thoe passions
of the slaves; and, in the language of Gcn. JackÂ­
son, to ""stimulate them to insurrection, and proÂ­
duce all the horrors of a servile war."" This agiÂ­
tation has ever since been continued by the pubÂ­
lic press; by the proceedings of State and counÂ­
ty conventions, and by abolition sermons and
lectures. The time of Congress has been occupied
in violent speeches on this never-ending subject;
and appeals, in pamphlet and other forms, endorsed
by distinguished names, have been sent forth from
this central point, and spread broadcast over the
Union.
How easy would it be for the American peoÂ­
ple to settle the slavery question forever, and to
restore peace and harmony to this distracted
country.
They, and they alone can do it. All thetis neÂ­
cessary to accomplish the object, and all for which
the slave States have ever contended, is to be let
alone, and permitted to manage their domestic inÂ­
stitutions in their own way. As sovereign States
they, and they alone, are responsible before God
and the world for the slavery existing araong
them. For this, the people of the North are not
more responsible, and have no more right to inÂ­
terfere, than with similar institutions in Russia or
in Brazil. Upon their good sense and patriotic forÂ­
bearance, I confess I still greatly rely. Without
their aid, it is beyond the power of any President,
no matter what may be his own political proclivÂ­
ities, to restore peace and harmony among the
States. Wisely limited and restrained as is his
power under our Constitution and laws, he alone
can accomplish but little, for good or evil, on such
a momentous question.
And this brings me to observe, that the election
of any one of our follow-citizens to the office of
Presildent, is not sufficient cause for dissolving
the Union. This is more especially true if his elecÂ­
tion has been effected by a mere plurality, and
not a majority, of the people, and has resulted
from trninsiont and temporar' causes, which nmay
probably never again occur. In order to justify
a resort to revolutionary resistance, the Federal
Goverrnrlent must be guilty of ""a deliberate, palÂ­
pable aud dangerous exorcise"" of powers not grantÂ­
ed by the Constitution. The late Presidcntial
election, however, has been held in strict conformÂ­
ity with its express provisions. ow, theni,. can
thie result justify' a revolution to destroy this lvery
Constitution? RIeason, justice, a regard lbr the
Constitution, all requiroe that we shall wait forsome
overt and dangerous ract on thre part of thie PI'eiÂ­
dent elect before resorting to surch a remedy.
It
is said, however, that the antecedents of the
Presidtent clect have been suflicient to justily the
iears of the South that he will attempt to invade
their constitutional richts. But .ire,,.l ,n
, .....


hensions of contingent danger in the future sillÂ­
cient to justify the immediate destruction of the
noblest system of government ever devised by
mortals ? From the very nature of his office, aid
its high responsibilities, he must necessarily be
conservative. The stern duty of administering
the vast and complicated concerns of this governÂ­
ment affords, in itself, a guarantee that he will
not attempt any violation of a clear constitutional
right. After all, he is no more than the chief exÂ­
ecutive officer of the government. IIis province is
not to make, but to execute, the laws; and it is a
remarkable fact in our history, that, notwithstanÂ­
ding the repeated eflbrts of the anti.slavery party,
no single act has ever passed Congress, unless we
may possibly except the Missouri Compromise, imÂ­
pairing, in the slightest degree, the rights of the
South to their property in slaves. And it may
also be observed, judging from present indications,
that no probability exists of the passage of such an
act, by a majority of both Houses, either in the
present or the next Congress. Surely, under
these circumstances, we ought to be restrained
from present action by the precept of Him who
spake as never man spoke, that
"" sufficient unto
the day is the evil thereof."" The day oi evil may
never come, unless we shall rashly bring it upon
ourselves.
Itis alleged, as one cause for immediate secesÂ­
sion, that the Southern States are denied equal
rights with the other States in the common TerriÂ­
tories. But by what authority are those denied ?
Not by Congress,which has never passed, and I beÂ­
lieve never will pass, any act to exclude slavery
from these Territories; and certainly not by the
Supreme Court,which has solemnly decided that
slaves are property, and, like all other property,
their owners have a right to take them into the
common Territories, and hold them there under
the protection of the Constitution.
So far, then, as Congress is concerned, the obÂ­
jection is not to anything they have already done,
but to what they may do hereafter. It villsurely
be admitted tihat this apprehension of future danÂ­
ger is no good reason for an immediate di solution
of the Union. It is true that the Territorial LegÂ­
islature of Kansas, on the 23d of February, lac0,
passed, in great haste, an act; over the veto of the
Governor, declaring that slavery I., and shall be,
forever prohibited in this Ter'riory."" Sueh an
act, however, plainly vio)lae

ty secured by the Conaeitiue., y, e.:,,I hybe deÂ­
clared void by thejudiu:s

preme Court of the United :%i in,;,;nl"" :,dÂ­
judged that this power did wit eri-' in TerriteÂ­
rial 'Legislature. Yet such li: benm the facÂ­
tious temper of the times that the correctness of
thisdecision has been extensively impugned beÂ­
fore the people, and the question has given rise to
angry political confliefs throughout the country.
Those who have appealed from this judgment of
our highest constitutional tribunal to popular asÂ­
semblies would, if they could, invest a Territorial
l,""gishtirr with power lo annul the sacred rights




 of property. This power Congress is exrsreesly
forbidden by the Federal Constitution to exercise.
Every State Legislature in the Union is forbidden
by its own constitution to exercise it. It cannot
be exercised in any State except by the people in
I
their highest sovereign capacity when framnirg or
amending their State constitution. In like manÂ­
ner, it can only be exercised by the people of a
Territory represented ina convention of delegates
I
for the purpose of framing a constitution preparÂ­
atory to admission as a State into the Union.Â­
Then, and not until then, are they invested with
power to decide the question whether slavery shall
t
or shall not exist within their limits. This is an
act of sovereign authority, and not of subordinate
terrritorial legislation. Were it otherwise, then
I
indeed would the equality of the States in the
Territories be destroyed, and the rights of properÂ­
[
ty in slaves would depend, not upon the guaranÂ­
3
tees of the Constitution, but upon the shifting
majorities of an irresponsible Territorial LegislaÂ­
ture. Such a doctrine, from its intrinsic unsoundÂ­
ness, cannot long influence any considerable porÂ­
tion of our people, much less can it afford a good
reason for a dissolution of the Union.
The most palpable violations of constitutional
I duty which have yet been committed consist in
the acts of different State Legislatures to defeat
3
the execution of the Fugitive Slave law. It ought
3
to be remembered, hoh ever, that for these acts, n eiÂ­
i
ther Congress nor any President can justlybe held
responsible. Having been passed in violation of
f the Federal Constitution, they are, therefore, null
I and void. All the courts, both State and national,
before whom the question has arisen, have, from
the beginning, declared the Fugitive Slave law
to be constitutional. The single exception is that
3 of a State court in Winconsin; and this has not
only been reversed by the proper appellate tribuÂ­
nal, but has mint with such universal reprobation
1
that there can be no danger from itasa precedent.
1
The validity of this law has been established over
Sand over again by the Supreme Court of the U.
-
States with perfect unanimity. It is founded upon
an express provision of the Constitution, requirÂ­
1 ing that fugitive slaves who escape from service
I in one State to another shall be ""dolivored tip"" to
their masters. Without this provision, itis a well
f known historical fact that the Constitution itself
- could never have been adopted by the Convention.
9 In one form or other under the acts of 1703 and
1 1850, both being substantially the same, the FuÂ­
t
giive Slavelaw has been the law of the land from
3
the days of Washington until the present moÂ­
-
mont. Here, then, a clear case is presented, in
t which it will be the duty of the next President,
as it has been my own, to act with vigor in exeÂ­
cuting this supreme law against the conflicting
Senactments of State Legislatures. Should he fail
in the performance of thishigh duty, he will then
I
have manifested a disregard of the Constitution
i
and laws, to the great injury of the people of nearÂ­
i
ly one-half of the States of the Union.. But are
we to presume, in advance, that he will thus vioÂ­
1
late his duty ? This would be at war with every
principle of justice and Christian charity. Let us
3
wait for the overt act. The Fugitive Slave law
has been carried into execution in every contested
case since the commencement of the present AdÂ­
ministration ; though often it is to bet regretted,
with great loss and inconvenience to the master,
- and with considerable oxpenso.tothe government.
Let us trust that the State Legislatures will repeal
their unconstitutional and obnoxious enactments.
- Unless this shall be done without unnecessary deÂ­
lay, it is impossible for any human power to save
- the Union.
The Southern States, standing on the basis of
1
the Constitution, have a right to demand this act
1
of justice from the States of the North. Should
it be refused, then the Constitution, to which all
3 the States are parties, will have been wilfully vioÂ­ v
lated by one portion of them in a provision essonÂ­
t tial to the domestic security and happiness of the
remainder. In that event, the injured States, afÂ­
tor having first used all peaceful and constitutionÂ­
s al means to obtain redress, would be justified in
I revolutionary resistance to the government of the
Union.
I have purposely confined my remarks to revoÂ­
h
lutionary resistance, because it has been claimed,
wt ithin the last few years, that any State, whenÂ­
- over this shall be its sovereign will and pleasure,
may secede from the Union, in accordance with
I
the Constitution, and without any violation of the
constitutional rights of the other members of the
t Confederacy. That as each became parties to the
- Union by the vote of its own people assembled in
r
Convention, so any one of them may retire from
-
the Union in a similar manner by the vote of
t such a Convention.
In order to justify secession as it constitutional
-
remedy, it must be on the principle that the Fed.
3
oral Government is a mere voluntary association
of States, to be dissolved at pleasure by any one
3
of the contracting parties. If this be so, the
I Confederacy is a rope of sand, to be penetrated
and dissolved by the first adverse wave of public
5 opinion in any of the States. In this manner our
thirty-three States may resolve themselves into as
Imany petty, jarring and hostile republics, each
-
one retiring from the Union without responsibili.
I
ty, whenever any suddlen excitement mightimpel
1
thorn to such a course. By this process a Union
might be entire ly brokeni into fragments in a few
Sweeks,
which cost ocur forefltlhbers many years of
1 toil, privation uand blood to etabiish.
Such a principle is wholly iinconsistent with
the hlistorv ast well as the chanracter of thile FedÂ­
1 oral Counstitutioi. After it was framtne, with
-
thile greatest delibicration aud care, it wansshubmnitÂ­

is, that it was not until Illny rears after the orÂ­
Sigin of the Federal (tovorninentlt that such a proÂ­
1position was first advanced. It was then met
Sand refuted by the conclusive arguments (f CGenÂ­
eral .laeckson, who in his message of 16th JalluÂ­
a nry, 1883, transmitting the nullifying ordinance
-of South Carolina to Congress, cmiploys the folÂ­
Sloewing
language: ""The right of the people of
Sa single State to absolve themselves at will, and
without the consent of the other States, front
1
their most solemn obligations, and hazard the
liberty and happiness of the millions comnllosing
this Union, cannot be acknowledged. Such nuÂ­
Sthority' is believed to be utterly repugnant both
l
to the principles upon which the General GovÂ­
Sernment is constituted and to the objects which
it was expressly formed to attain.""
It is not pretended that any clause in the ConÂ­
stitution gives countenance to such a: theory.
It is altogether founded upon inference, not from
any language contained in the instrument itself,
but from the sovereign character of the several
States by which it was ratified. But is it beyond
the power of a State, like an individual, to yield
a portion of its sovereign rights to secure the reÂ­
mainder ? In the language of Mr. Madison, who
has been called the father of the Constitution:
""It was formed by the States-that is, by the peoÂ­
ple in each of the States, acting in their highest
sovereign capacity; and formed consequently by
the same authority which formed the State ConÂ­
stitutions.""
""Nor is the Government of the United States,
created by the Constitution, less a Government in
the strict sense of the term, within the sphere of
its powers, than the governments created by the
Constitutions of the States, are within their seveÂ­
ral spherea. It is, like them, organized into legÂ­
isiative, executive, and judiciary departments. It
operates, like them, directly on persons and things;
and, like them, it has at command a physical
force for executing the powers committed to it.""
It was intended to be perpetual, and not to he
annulled at the pleasure of any one of the conÂ­
tracting parties. The c:d articles of confederaÂ­
tion were entitled ""Articles of Confederation and
Perpetual Union between the States;"" and by the
13th article it is expressly declared that ""the artiÂ­
cles of this Confederation shall be inviolably obÂ­
served by every State, and the Union shall be
perpetual."" The preamble to the Constitution of
the United States, having express reference to the
articles of confederation, recites that it was estabÂ­
lished ""in order to form a more perfect union.""
And yet it is contended that this ""more perfect
union"" does not include thle nssential attribute of
perpetuity,

 But that the Union was designed to be perpetÂ­
ual appears conclusively from the nature and exÂ­ I
tent of the powers conferred by the Constitution
-
on the Federal Government. These powers emÂ­
brace the very highest attributes of national sovÂ­ 2
ereignty. They place both, the sword and the
purse under its control. Congress has power to
make war, and to make peace; to raise and supÂ­
portarmies and navies, and to conclude treaties
with foreign governments. It is invested with
the power to coin money, and to regulate the valÂ­ I
ue thereof, and to regulate commerce with foreign
nations, and among the several States. It is not i
necessary to enumerate the other high powers I
which have been conferred upon the Federal GovÂ­ I
ernment. In order to carry the enumerated powÂ­
ers into effect, Congress possesses the exclusive
right to lay and collect duties on imports, and
in common with the States to lay and collect all
other taxes.
But the Constitution has not only conferred
these high powers upon Congress, but it has sadoptÂ­
ed effectual means to restrain the States from inÂ­
I terfering with their exercise. For that purpose
it has, in strong prohibitory language, expressly 1
I declared that ""no State shall enter into any treaty,
alliance, or confederation; grant letters of marque
and reprisal ; coin money ; emit bills of credit;
make anything but gold and silver coin a tender
'in payment of debts; pass any bill of attainder,
eI x post facto law, or law impairing the obligation
i of contracts."" Moreover, ""without the consent
I of Congress, no State shall lay any imposts or duÂ­
ties on any imports or exports, except what may
b he absolutely necessary for executing its inspecÂ­
r
tion laws ;"" and, if they exceed this amount, the
t
excess shall belong to the United States.
L And ""no State shall, without the consent of
Congress, lay any duty of tonnage; keep troops,
I or ships of war, in time of peace; enter into any
agreement or compact with another State, or with
a Loreign power; or engage in war, unless actually
invaded, or in such imminent danger as will not
I admit of delay.""
In order still furthelr to secure the uninterruptÂ­
3
ed exercise of these high powers against State inÂ­
>
terposition, it is provided ""that this Constitution
I and the laws of the United States which shall be
made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made,
or which shall be made, under the authority of
1
the United States, shall be the supreme law of the
land; and the judges in every Stateshall be bound
I thereby, anything in the Constitution or laws of
any State to the contrary notwithstanding.""
i The solemn sanction of religion has been suÂ­
piradded to the obligations of official duty, and all
seonators and representatives of the United States,
all members of State legislatures, and all execuÂ­
Stive and judicial officers, ""both of the United
. States and of the several States, shall be bound by
i oath or affirmation to support this Constitution.""
In order to carry into effect these powers, the
3 Constitution has established a perfect Government
- in all its forms, Legislative, Executive, and JudiÂ­
r cial; and this Government, to the extent of its
s
powers, acts directly upon the individual citizens
r
of every State, and executes its own decrees by
I the agency of its own officers. in this respect it
differs entirely from the Government under the
old Confederation, which was confined to making
requisitions on the States in their sovereign charÂ­
acter. This left it in the discretion of each whethÂ­
1 er to obey or to refuse, and they often declined to
comply with such requisitions. It thus became
necessary, for the purpose of removing this barÂ­
n rior, and ""in order to form ia more perfect Union,""
to establish a Government which could act directÂ­
f
ly upon the people, and executoits own laws withÂ­
t
out the intermediate agency of the States. This
I has been accomplished by the Constitution of the
I United States.
In short, the Government created by the Con.
stitution, and deriving its authority from the sovÂ­
3 ereign people of sach of the several States, has
precisely the same right to exercise its power over
the people of all these States, in the enumerated
I eases, that each one of them possesses over subjects
e
not delegated to the United States but ""reserved
to the States, respectively, or to the people.""
To the extent of the delegated powers the ConÂ­
, stitution of the United States is as much a part of
the Constitution of each State, and is as binding
upon its people, as though it had been textually
i
inserted therein.
3
This Government, therefore, is a great and powÂ­
erful Government, invested with all the attributes
3
of sovereignty over the special subjects to which
its authority extei.ds. Its framers never intended
to Implant in its bosom the seeds of its own doÂ­
f struction, nor were they at its creation guilty of
the absurdity of providing for its own dissolution.
I It was not intended by its framers to ha the baseÂ­
less fabric of a vision which, at the touch of the
enchanter, would vanish into thin air, but a subÂ­
stantial and mighty fabric, capable o:' resistingtho
slow decay of tinm and of defying the storms of
Iages. Indeed, well may the jealous patriots of
that day have indulged fears that agovernnment of
such high powers might violate the reserved rights
of the States, and wisely did they adopt the rule
of a dtrict construction of these powers to prevent
the danger! But they did not fear, nor had they
I any' reason to imagine, that the Constitution
I would ever be so interpretted as to enable any
SState
by her own aict, and without the consent of
Fher
sistor States, to discharge her peopl'e from all
or any of their Federals obligations.
It may be asked, then, are tihe people of tilhe

crnmsents have been destroyed, and new ones have
taken their place. It is embodied in strong and exÂ­
press language in our own Declaration of IndeponÂ­
deuce. But the distinction must ever be observed,
that this is revolution against an established GovÂ­
ernment, and not a voluntary secession from it
by virtue of an inherent constitutional right. In
short. let us look the danger fairly in the face : SeÂ­
cession is neither more no, less than revolution.
It may or it may not lie ai justifiable revolution,
but still it is revolution.
What, in the meati time, is the responsibility
anrl true position of the Executive
- lle is bound
by solemn oath before God and the country ""to
take care that thel laws be faithfully executed,""
and from this obligation lie cannot be absolved by
any human power. But what if the performance
of this duty, in whole or in part, has been renderÂ­
ed impracticable ty revets over which lie could
have exercised no control'.' Such, at the present
moment, is the case throughout the State of South
Carolina, so far as the laws of the United States
to secure the administration of justice by means
of the Federal Judiciary are concerned. All the
Federal officers within its limits, through whose
agency alone these laws can be carried into exeÂ­
cution, have already resigned. We no longer
have a district judge, a district attorney, or a marÂ­
shal in South Carolina. In fact the whole mnaÂ­
chinery of the Federal Government, necessary for
the distribution of remedial justice among the
people, has been demolished; and it would be difÂ­
ficult, if not impossible, to replace it.
The only acts of Congress on the statute-book,
bearing upon this subject, are those of the 28th
February, 1795, and 3d March, 1807. These nuÂ­
thorize thi President, after he shall have ascerÂ­
tained that the marshal with his posse eomiiatus
is unable to execute civil or criminal process in
any particular case, to call forth the militia and
employ the army and navy to aid him in perÂ­
forming this service, having first by Proclamation
commanded the insurgents ""to disperse and retire
peaceably to their respective abodes, within a limÂ­
ited time."" This duty cannot by possibility be
performed in a State where no judicial authority
exists to issue process, and where there is no marÂ­
shal to execute it, and where, even if there were
a
such an officer, the entire population would codl
f
stitute one solid combination to resist him.
The bare enumeration of these provisions
proves how inadequate they are without further
legislation to overcome a united opposition in a
t
single State, not to speak of othei States who may
place themselves in a similar attitude. Congress
I alone has power to decide whether the present
laws can or cannot be amendedso as to carry out
a
more eofectually the objects of the Constitution.
The same insuperable obstacles do not lie in the
way of executing the laws for the collection of
1
the customs. The revenue still continues io be
3
collected, as heretofore, at the custom-house in
- Charleston; and should the collector unfortunately
- resign, a successor may be appointed to perform
a
this duty.
f Then in regard to the property of the United
D States in South Carolina. This has been purÂ­
chased for a fair equivalent, ""by the consent of the
legislature of the State,"" ""for the erection of forts,
t magazines, arsenals,"" &c., and over these the auÂ­
f thority ""to exercise exclusive legislation"" has been
expressly granted by the Constitution to Coin

 gross. It is not believed that any attempt willhe
made to expel the United States from this propÂ­
erty by force; but if in this I should prove to be
mistaken, the officer in command of the forts has
received orders to act strictlyon the defensive. In
such a contingency, the responsibility for conseÂ­
quences would rightfully rest upon the heads of
the assailants.
Apart from the execution of the laws, so far as
this may be practicable, the Executive has no auÂ­
thority to decide what shall be the relations beÂ­
tween the federal government and South CaroliÂ­
na. He has been invested with no such discreÂ­
tion. He possesses no power to change the relaÂ­
tions heretofore existing between them, much less
to acknowledge the independence of that State.
This would be to invest a mere Executive officer
with the power of recognising the, dissolution of
the Confederacy among our thirty-three sovereign
States. It bears no resemblance to the recogniÂ­
tion of a foreign de facto government, involving
no such responsibility. Any attempt to do this
would, on hispart, boa naked act:of usurpation.
It is, therefore, my duty to submit to Congress
the whole question in all its bearings. The course
of events is so rapidly hastening forward, that the
emergency may soon arise, when you may be callÂ­
ed upon to decide the momentous question whethÂ­
er you posess the power, by force of arms, to
compel a State to remain in the Union. I should
feelmyself recreant to my duty wero.I not to exÂ­
press an opinion on this important subject.
The question fairly stated is: Has the ConstiÂ­
tution delegated to Congress the power to coerce
a State into submission which is attempting to
withdraw or has actually withdrawn from the
Confederacy? If answered in the affirmative, it
must be on the principle that the power has been
conferred upon Congress to declare and to make
war against a State. After much serious reflecÂ­
tion I have arrived at the conclusion that no such
power has been delegated to Congress or to. any
other department of the Federal Government. It
is manifest, upon an inspection of the Constitution,
that this is not among the specific and enumerÂ­
ated powers granted to Congress; and it is equal.
ly apparent that its exercise is not ""necessary and
proper for carrying into execution"" any one of
these posers. So far from this power having
been delegated to Congress, it was, expressly reÂ­
fused by the convention which framed the ConÂ­
stitution.
It appears, from the proceedings of that body,
that on the 31stof May, 1787, the clause, ""uothorÂ­
-izing
an exertion of the force of the whole against
a delinquent State"" came up for consideration,
Mr. Madison opposed it in a brief but powerful
speech, from which I shall extract but a single
I
sentence. He observed: ""The use of force
against a State would look more-like a declaration
of war than an infliction of punishment; and
would probably be considered by the party atÂ­
tacked as a dissolution of all previous compacts by
which it might be bound."" Upon his motion the
clause was unanimously postponed, and was novÂ­
or I believe again presented Soon afterwards,
on the 8th of June, 1787, when incidentally adÂ­
o
verting to the subject, he said : ""Any GovernÂ­
ment for the United States, formed on the supÂ­
posed practicability of using force against the unÂ­
constitutional proceedings of the States, would
prove as visionary and fallacious as the GovernÂ­
meont of Congress,""evidently meaning the then
existing Congress of the old Confederation.
Without descending to particulars, it may
be safely asserted, that the power to make war
against a State is at variance with the whole spirÂ­
it and intent of the Constitution. Suppose such
a war should result in the conquest of a State,
how are we to govern it afterwards? Shr.ll we
hold it as a province, and govern it by despotic
power ? In the nature of things we could not,by
physical force, control the will of the people, and
compel them to elect senators and renresentatives
to Congress, and to perform all the other duties
I depending upon their own volition, and required
from the citizens of a free State as a constituent
I
member of the Confederacy.
But, if we possessed this power, would it be wise
to exercise it under existing circumstances? The
f
object would doubtless be to preserve the Union.
War would not only present the most effectual
means of destroying it; but would banish all hope
of its peaceable reconstruction. Besides, in the
fraternalconflict, a vast amount of blood and
treasure would be expended, rendering future
reconciliation betweer the States impossible. In
the mean time, who can foretell what would be
the sufferings and privations o'f the people during
its existence?
The fact is, that our Union rests upon public
opinion and can never be cemented by the blood
of its citizens shed in civil war. If it cannot live
in the affections of the people, it must one day
perish. Congress possess many means of preÂ­
serving it by conciliation, but the sword was not
placed in their hand to preselvoit by force.
But may I be permitted solemnly to invoke
imy countrymen to pause and deliberate, before
they determine to destroy this, the grandest temÂ­
pil which has ever beeon dedicated to lhumian
freedom since the world began? It has been
consecrated by the blood of our fathers, by the
g'lrics of the past, and by the hopes of the thÂ­
urec. ThI Union has alreadv made us the most
IprospIerous and, ere long, will,if preserved,render
us the most powerfulid nation on the face of the
earth. In every foreign region of the globe the
title of American citizen is held in the highest
respect. and when pronounced in a foreign land
it causes te hearts of our countrvmens to swell
with honest pride. Surely whent we reach the
brink of the yawning abyss, we shall recoil with
Ihorror from the last fatitl plunge. By such a


tiread ceatastrophe the hopes of the friends of
freedom throughout the world would be destroyÂ­
ed, and along night of leaden despotism would enÂ­
shroud the nations. Our example for more than
eighty years would not only be lost; but it would
be quoted as a conclusive proof that man is unfit
for sclf-governmieIt.
Itis notev ery wrong-nay, itis not cverygrievous
wrong--which can justify a resort tosuch a fearÂ­
ful alternative. This ought to be thelast desperÂ­
ate remedy of a despairing people, after every
other constitutional means of conciliation had
been exhausted. We should reflect that under
l
this free Government there is an incessant ebb
>
and flow in public opinion. The slavery quesÂ­
tion, like everything htunan, will have its day.
I lirmly believe that it has already reached and
passed the cuhninating point. But if, in the
midst of the existing excitement, the Union
I
shall perish, the evil may then become irreparaÂ­
t
ble. Congress can contribute much to avert it
I
byproposing and reconumending to the legislatures
of the several States the remedy for existing
i
evils, which the Constitution has itself provided
1
for its own preservation. This has been tried
at different critical periods of our history, and
always with eminent success. It is to be found
in the 5th article providing for its own amendÂ­
ment. Under this article amendments have
been proposed by two-thirds of both houses of
Congress, and have been ""ratified by thelegislaÂ­
tlures of three-fourths of the several States,"" and
- have consequently become parts of the ConstituÂ­
tion. To this process the country is indebted
for the clause prohibiting Congress from passing
1
any law respecting an es'ablislhment of religion,
or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the
-
press, or of the right of petition. To this we
are, also, indebted for the Bill of Rights, which
secures the people against :any abuse of power by
I the Federal Government. Such werethe appreÂ­
hensions justly eltoertained by the friends of
I
State-rights at that period as to have rendered
it extremely doubtful whether the Constitution
could have long survived without these amendÂ­
3
ments.
Again, the Constitution was amended by the
same process after the election of President JetÂ­
s
ferson by the House of Representatives, in FebÂ­
ruary, 1803. This amendment was rendered neÂ­
cessary to prevent a recurrence of the dangers
which had seriously threatened the existence of
the Government during the pondency of that
election. The article for its own anendment was
r
intended to secure the amicable adjustment of conÂ­
Sflicting
constitutional questions. like the present,
t
which might arise between the governments of
t
the States and that of the United States.
. This
appears from contemporaneous history. In this
connection, I shall merely call attention to a few
f
sentences in Mr. Madison's justly celebrated reÂ­
port, in 1799, to the legislature of Virginia. In
h
this he ably and conclusively defended the resoluÂ­
r
tions of the preceding legislature against the
t strictures of several other State legislatures.Â­
These were mainly founded upon the protest of
t
the Virginia legislature against the ""Alien and
Sedition Acts,"" as ""palpable and alarming inÂ­
fractions of the Constitution."" In pointing out
the peaceful and constitutional remedies, and he
referred to none other, to which the States were
anthorised to resort, on such occasions, he
concludes by saying, "" that the legtslatures of

 the States might hbae made
i direct repre-I
sentation to Congress Awith a view to obtain a
rescinding of the trvb ofbensive acts, or they might
have represented to their respective Senators in
Congress their wish thattwothirds thereof would
propose an explanatory amendment to the ConstiÂ­
tution: or two-thirds of themselves, if such 'had
been their option, might, by an ,application to
Cohgress, have obtained a convention for the
same object.""
This is the very course which I earnestly reÂ­
commend in order to obtainÂ­ an _"" explanatory
amendment"" of the Constitution on the subject of
slavery. This might originate with Congress or
the State legislatures, as may be deemed most
advisable so attain the object .
The explanatory amendment might be confinÂ­
ed to the final settlement of the true construction
of the Constitution on three special points:
1. An express recognition of the right of proÂ­
perty in slaves in the States where it now exists
or may hereafter exist.
2. The duty of protecting.this right in all the
common territories throughout their territorial
existence, and until they shall be admitted as
States into the Union, with or without slavery, as
their constitutions may prescribe.
3. A like recognition of the right of the masÂ­
ter to have his slave, who has escaped from one
State to another,. restored, and ""delivered up"" to
him, and of the validity of the fugitive slave law
enacted for this purpose, together with a, declaraÂ­
tion that all State laws impairing or defeating
this right are violations of the Constitution, and
are consequently null and void.
It may be objected that this construction of the
Constitution has already been settled by the SuÂ­
preme Court of the United States, and what more
ought to be required? The answer is, that a very
large proportion of the people of the United States
still contest the correctness of this decision, and
never will cease from agitation and admit. its
binding force until clearly established by 'the peoÂ­
ple of the States in their sovereigrn character.Â­
Such an explanatory amendment would, it is beÂ­
lieved, forever terminate the existing aissensions
and restore peace and harmony among the States.
It ought not to be doubted that such an appeal
to the arbitrament established by the Constitution
itself would be received with favor by all the
States of the Confederacy. In any event it ought
to be tried in a spirit of conciliation before any
of these States shall separate themselves from the
Union.
When I entered upon the duties of the presiÂ­
dential office, the aspect neither of our foreign
nor domestic affairs was at all satisfactory. We
were involved in dangerous complications with sevÂ­
eral nations, and two of our territories were, in a
state of revolution against the governmuent. A
restoration of the African slave trade had numerÂ­
ous and powerful advocates. Unlawful military
expeditions were countenanced by many of our
citizens, and were suffered, in defiance of the efÂ­
forts of the government, to escape from our shores,
for the purpose of makingÂ­ war upon the unofÂ­
fending people of neighboring republics with
whom we were at peace. In addition to these
and other difficulties, we experienced a revulsion
in monetary affairs, soon after my advent to powÂ­
er, of unexampled severity and of ruinous conssÂ­
quences to all the great interests of the country.
When we take a retrospect of what was thenour
condition and contrast this with its material prosÂ­
perity at the time of the late presidential election,
we have abundant reason to return our grateful
thanks to that merciful Providence which has
never forsaken us as a nation in all our past trials.
OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS.
OREAT aBRITAIN.
Our relations with Great Britain are of the most
friendly character. Since the commencement of
my administration, the two dangerous questions,
arising from the Clayton and Bulwor treaty and
from the right of search, claimed by the British
government, have been amicably and honorably
adjusted.
The discordant constructions of the Clayton and
Bulwer treaty between the two eovernments,
which, at different periods of the discussion, bore
a threatening aspect, have resulted in a final setÂ­
tlement entirely satisfactory to this government.
In my last annual message I informed Congress
that the British government had not then "" com-rn
pleted treaty arrangements ""-ith the republics of~
Honduras and Nicaragua, in pursuance of the unÂ­
derstanding between the two governments. It
is, nevertheless, confidently expected that this
good work will ere long be accomplished."" This
confident expectation has since been fulfilled.Â­
Her Britanic Majesty concluded a treaty with
Honduras on the 28th November, 1859, and with
Nicaragua on the 28th August, 1860, relinquish.
ing the Mosquito protectorale. Besides, by the
former, the Bay Islands are recoanised as a part
of the republic of lHonduras. It may be obÂ­
served that the stipulations of these treaties conÂ­
form in every important partii-lar to the amendÂ­
ments adopted by the Senate of the United States
to the treaty conclud'ed at London on the 17th
October: 1856, between the two, governments. It
will be recollected that this treaty was rejected by
the British government beculse of its objection
to the just and important amendment of the Sn
ate to the article relating to Riuatan and the other
islands in the Bay of Honduras.
It must be a source of sincere satisfaction to all
classes of our fellow-citizens, and especially to
those engaged in foreign commerce, that the
claim, on the part of Great Britain, forcibly to
visit and search American merchant veasels on I
the high seas in time of peace, has been abandonÂ­
ed. This was by far the most dangerous ouestion


cyuu F.... Ã½Ã½s u1 awv vuunies wIwen naS existÂ­
ed since the war of 1812. Whilst it remained
open, they might at any moment have been preÂ­
cipitated in,o a war. This was rendered manifest
by the exasperated state of public feeling throughÂ­
out our entire country, produced by the forcible
search of American merchant vessels by British
cruisers on the coast of Cuba, in the spring of
1858. The American people hailed with general
acclaim the orders of the Secretary of the Navy
to our naval force in the Gulf of M3exico, ""to
protect all vessels of the United States on the
high seas from searbh or detention by the vessels.
of-war of any other nation."" Theseorders might
have produced an immediate collision between
the naval forces of the two countries. This was
most fortunately prevented by an appeal to the
justice of Great Britain and to the law of nations
as expounded by her own most eminent jurists..
The only question of any importance which
still remains open is the disputed title between the
two governments to the island of San Juan, in
the vicinity of Washington Territory. As this
question is still under negotiation, it is not deem.
ed advisable at the present monment to make any
other allusion to the subject.
The recent visit of the Prince of Wales, in a
private character, to the people of this country,
has proved to be a most auspicious event. In its
consequences, it cannot fail to increase the kindred
and kindly feelings which I trust may ever actuÂ­
ate the government and people of both countries
in their political and social intercourse with each
other.
FRANCE.
With France, our ancient and powerful ally,
our relations continue to be of the most friendly
character. A decision hasrecently been made by
a French judicial tribunal, with the approbation
of the Imperial Government, which cannot fail
to foster the sentiments of mutual regard that have
so long existed between the two countries. UnÂ­
der the French law no person can serve in the
armies of France unless he be a French citizen.
The law of France recognising the natural right
of expatriation, it follows as a necessary consequence
that a Frenchman, by the fact of having become
a citizen of the United States, has changed his alleÂ­
giance and has lost his native character. Hecannot,
therefore, be compelled to serve in the French
armies in case he should return to his native counÂ­
try. Thesn principles were announced in 1852
by the French Minister of War, and in two late
cases have been confirmed by the French judiciaÂ­
ry. In these, two natives of France have been
discharged from the French army because they
had become American citizens.. To employ the
language of our present minister to France, who
has rendered good service on this occasion, ' I do
not think our French naturalized fellow.citizens
will hereafter experience much annoyance on this
subiject."" I venture to predict that the time is not
far distant when the other continental powers will
adopt the same wise and just policy which has
done so much honor to the enlightened governÂ­
ment of the Emperor. In any event, our govÂ­
ernment is bound to protect the rights of our natÂ­
uralized citizens everywhere to the same extent
as though they had drawn their first breath in
this country. We can recognise no distinction
between our native and naturalized citizens.
RUssrI.
Between the great empire ol Russia and the.

 United States the mutual friendship and regard
which has so long existed still continues to preÂ­
vail, and, -if Dossible, -to .increase. Indeed, our
relations with that Empire are all that we could
desire.
Â·spaIN 7
Our relations with Spain are now of a more
complicated though less dangerous character than
they have been for many years. Our citizens
have long held, and continue - to hold, numerous
claims against the Spanish. government. These
had been ably urged for a series of years by our
successive diplomatic representatives at Madrid,
but without obtaining redress. The Spanish
government finally agreed to institute a joint
commissionmfor the: adjustment of these claims,
and on the 5th day of March, 1860, concluded a
convention for this purpose with our present
minister at Madrid.
: Under this convention,
what have been denominated ""the Cuban
claims,"" amounting to $128,635 and 64 cents, in
which more than one hundred of our fellow-citiÂ­
zons are interested, were recognized, and the
Spanish government agreed toÂ­ pay $100,000 of
this amount I.within three months following the
exchange of ratifications.""
. The .payment of the
remaining $28,636 64 was.to await. thedecision
of the commissioners for or against ""the Amistad
claim ;"" but in any event the balance was to be
paid to the claimants either by Spain, or the
United States. These terms I have every reaÂ­
son to know are highly satisfactory to the holdÂ­
ers of the Cuban claims. Indeed, they -have
made a formal offer authorizing the State DeÂ­
partment to""settle these claims, and to deduct
the amount of the Amistad claim from the sums
which they are ehtitled to receive from Spain.
This offer, of course, cannot he accepted.
All other claims of citizens of the United States
against Spain, or 'of subjects of the Queen of
Spain against the United States, including the
""'Amistad claim,"" were by this convention reÂ­
ferred to aboard of commissioners in the usual
form. Neither the validity of the Amistad
claim nor of any other claim against either party,
with the single exception of the Cuban claims,
was recognised by the convention. Indeed, the
Spanish government did not insist that the vaÂ­
lidity of the Amistad claim should be thus recogÂ­
nised, notwithstanding its payment had, been
recommendedcto Congress by two of my predeÂ­
cessors as well as by myself, and an appropriaÂ­
tion for that purpose had passed the Senate of the
United States. They were content that it should
be submitted.to the board for examination and
decision, like the other claims. Both governÂ­
ments were bound respectively., to pay the
amounts awarded to the several claimants ""at
such times and places as may be fixed by and acÂ­
cording to the tenor of said awards.""
I transmitted this convention to the Senate
for their constitutional action on the 3d May,
1860, and on the 27th of the succeeding June
they-determined that they would. ""note advise
and consent"" to its ratification.
These proceedings place our relations with
Spain in an awkward and embarrassing position.
It is more than probable that the final adjustÂ­
ment of these claims will devolve upon my sucÂ­
cessor.
I reiterate therccommendation contained in
my Annual Message of December, 1858, and
repeated in that of December, 1859, in favor of
the acquisition of Cuba from Spain by fair purÂ­
chase. I firmly. believe that such an acquisition
would contribute essentially to the well-being
and prosperity of both countries in all future
time, as well as prove, the certain means of imÂ­
mediately abolishing the African slave-trade
throughout the world. I would not repeat this
accommendation upon the present occasion, if I
believed that the transfer of Cuba to the United
States, upon conditions highly favorable to Spain,
could justly tarnish the national honor of the
proud and ancient Spanish Monarchy. Surely
no person ever attributed to the first Napoleon a
disregard of the national honor of France, for
transferring Louisana to the United States for a
fair equivalent both in money and commercial
advantages.
AUSTRIA, &C.
With the Emperor ofAustria, and the remainÂ­
ing continental powers of Europe, including that
of the Sultan, our relations continue to be of the
most friendly character,
curxa.
The friendly and peacefulpolicy pursued by the
Government of the United States' towards the
empire of China has produced the most satisfacÂ­
tory results. The treaty of Tientsin of the lath
of June, 1858, has been faithfully observed by
the Chinese authorities. The convention of the
8th November, 1858,supplementary to this treaty,
for the adjustment and satisfaction of the
claims of our citizens on China, referred to in my
last Annual Message, has been already carried inÂ­
to effect, so far as this was practicable.
Under this convention the sum of 500,000 taels
equal to about $700,000, was stipulated to be
paid in satisfaction of the claims of American
citizens out of the one-fifth of the receipts for tonÂ­
nage import, and export duties on American
Svessels at the ports of Canton, Shanghae, and
IFuchau;
and it was ""agreed that this amount
shall be in full liquidation of all claims of AmerÂ­
icancitizens at the various ports to this date.""
Debentures for t' ~ amount-to wit: 300,000
taels for Canton,l' ,000 for Shaneghae, and 100,.
000 fur Fuchu--were delivered according to the
terms of the convention by the respective Chinese
collectors of the customs of these ports to the
agent selected by our minister to receive the same.
Since that t.mre the claims of our citizens have


been adjusted by the board of commissioners apÂ­
pointed for that purpose under the act of March
3, 1859, and their awards, which proved satisfacÂ­
t
tory to the claimants, have been approved by our
minister. In the aggregate they amount to the
sum of $498,694 78. The claimants have alreaÂ­
dy received a large proportion of the sums awardÂ­
ed to them out of the fund provided, and it is
. confidently expected that the remainder will ere
long he entirely paid. After the awards shall
have been satisfied, there will remain a surplus
of more than $200,000 at the disposition of ConÂ­
gress. As this will in equity belong to the ChiÂ­
nose government, would not justice require its
appropriation to some benevolent object in which
the Chinese may be specially interested?
Our minister to China, in obedience to his inÂ­
structions, has remained perfectly neutral in the
war between Great Britain and France and the
Chinese empire; although, in conjunction with
the Russian minister, he was ever ready and
willing, had the opportunity offered, te employ
his good offices in restoring peace between the
parties. It is but an act of simple justice, both to
our present minister and his predecessor, to state,
that they have proved fully equal to the delicate,
trying, and responsible positions in 'which they
have on different occasions been placed.
JAPAN.
The ratifications of the treaty with Japan, conÂ­
cluded at Yedo on the 29th July, 1858, were erÂ­
changed at Washington on the 22d of May last,
and the treaty itself was ploelaimed on the sucÂ­
ceeding day. There is good reason to expect that,
under its protection and influence, our trade and
intercourse with that distant and interesting peoÂ­
ple will rapidly increase.
The ratifications of the treaty were exchanged
with unusual solemnity. For this purpose the TyÂ­
coon had accredited three of his most distinguished
subjects as envoys extraordinary and ministers
plenipotentiary, who were received andi treated
with marked distinction and kindness both by the
Government and people of the United States.Â­
There is every reason to believe that they have reÂ­
turned to their native land entirely satisfied with
their visit, and inspired by the most friendly feelÂ­
ings for our country. Let us ardently hope, in
the language of the treaty itself, that ""there shall
henceforward be perpetual peace and friendship
between the United States of America and his
Majesty the Tycoon of Japan and his successors.""
BRAZIL.
With the wise, conservative, and liberal govÂ­
ernmnit of the empire of Brazil our relations cmnÂ­
tinue to be of the most amicable character.
NEW ORANADA.
The exchange of the ratifications of the convenÂ­
tion with the republic of New Granada, signed at
Washington on the 10th September, 1857, has
been long delayed from accidental causes, for
which neither party iscensurable. These ratificaÂ­
tions were duly exchanged in this city on the 5th
of November last. Thus has a controversy been
amicably terminated which had become soserious
at the period-of my inauguration, as to require
me, on the 17th of April, 1857, to direct our minÂ­
ister to demand his passports and returnuto 'heo
United States.
Under this convention the governmentof New
Granada has specially acknowledged itself to be
responsible to our citizens ""for, damages which
were caused by the rib' at Panama on the 5th of
April, 1856."" These claims, together with other

Under these circumstances, I deemed it mydutl

force to penetrate into the interior, where the
government of Miramon was to be found, with,
s or, if need be, without the consent of the Juarez
e government, though it was not doubted that this
consent could be obtained. Never have I ad

h
In addition-and I deem this a most important
consideration-European governments would have
r been deprived at all pretext to interfere in the
e territorial and domesticconcerns of Mexico. We
shouid thus have been relieved from the obligaÂ­
tion of resisting, even by force, should this be
s come necessary, any attempt by these governments
e to deprive our neighboring republic of portions of
her territory; a duty from which we could not
s
shrink without abandoning the traditional and
established policy of the American people. I nm
- happy to observe, that, firmly relying upon the
s justice and good faith of these governments, there
is'no present danger that such a contingency will
happen.
Having discovered that my recommendations
would not be sustained by Congress, the next alÂ­
ternative was to accomplish, In some degree, if
possible, the same objects by treaty stipulations
with the constitutional government. Such treaÂ­
ties were accordingly concluded by our late able
and excellent minister to Mexico, and on the 4th
January last were submitted to the Senate for ratÂ­
itication. As these have not yet received the tinl
action of that body, it would be improper for me
to present a detailed statement of their provisions.
Still I may be permitted to express the opinion in
advance that they are calculated to promote the
agricultural, manufacturing, and commercial inÂ­
terests of the country, and to secure our just influÂ­
ence with an adjoining republic as to whose forÂ­
tunes and fate we can never feel indifferent;
whilst at the same time they provide for the payÂ­
mont of a considerable amount towards the satisÂ­
faction of the claims of our injured fellow-cieiÂ­
zens.
KANSAS AND UTAH.
At the period of my inauguration I wasconÂ­ C
fronted in Kansas by a revolutionary governÂ­
ment existing under what is called the Topela
constitution. Its avowed object was to subdue the
territorial government by force, andtoinaugurate
what was called the Topeka govern men t in its stead.
To accomplish this object an extensive military
organization was formed and its command enÂ­
trusted to the most violent revolutionary loaders.
Under these circumstances, it became my looporaÂ­
tive duty to exert the whole constitutional power
of the Executive to prevent the flames of civil war
from again raging in Kansas, which, in the exÂ­
cited state of the public mind, both North and
South, might have extended into the neighboring
States.
The hostile parties in Kansas had been inÂ­
flamed against each other by emissaries both
from the North and the South, to a degree of
malignity without a parallel in our history. To
prevent actual collision, and to assist the civil
magistrates in enforcing the laws, a strong deÂ­
tichment of the army was stationed in the TerÂ­
ritory, ready to aid the marshal and his deputies,
when lawfully called upon, as a posse comitatuts
in the execution of civil and criminal process.
Still, the troubles in Kansas could not have
been permanently settled without an election by
the people. The ballot-box is the surest arbiter
of disputes among freemen. Under th:s convicÂ­
tion, every proper effort was employed to induce
the.hostile parties to vote at the election of deleÂ­
gates to frame a State constitution, and afterÂ­
wards at the election to decide whether Kansas
should be a slave or a free State. The insurgent
party petheed to vote at either, lest this might hb





P""""'~Cl-----`-Â­
o,,nidered a recognition on their part of the terÂ­
riteril ovvernrent established by Congress. A
reiter spirit, however, seemed soon after to preÂ­
l. and the two parties met face to face at the
i e etion, held on the first Monday of JanuÂ­
.185. for members of the legislature and
ite others under the Lecompton constitution;
ahe result was the triumph of the anti-slavery
,irt at the polls. This decision of the ballotÂ­
b.1proved clearly that this party were in the
Iajority, and removed the danger of civil war.
'
FrA, that time we have heard little or nothing
,f the Topeka government; and all serious danÂ­
er of revolutionary troubles inKansaswas then
t an end.
Th,' Lecompton constitution, which had been
hits recognized at this Sta'te election by the.votes
Cf both political parties in Kansas; was transÂ­
,itthd to me with the request that I should preÂ­
:ent it to Congress. This I could not have reÂ­
'ield to do without violating my clearest and
,tr,,ngst convictions of duty. The constitution,
:,nd all the proceedings which preceded and folÂ­
lowed its formation, were fair and regular on
their face. I then believed, and experience has
provedl, that the interests of the people of Kansas
would hav e been best consulted by its admission
:1; a State into the Union, especially as the minaÂ­
irity, within a brief period, could have amended
the constitution according to their will and
pleasure. If fraud existed in all or any of these
iroe'.dings, it was not for the ]?resident, but
:;r Congress, to investigate and determine the
,sl etion of fraud, and what ought to be its conÂ­
oquencs. If, at the two first elections, the maÂ­
jority refused to vote, it cannot be pretended that
this refusal to exercise the elective franchise
,ld invalidate an election fairly held under
lawfiul authority, even if they had not subseÂ­
quently voted at the third clcctipn. It is true
thlit the whole constitution had not been subÂ­
ritted to the people, as I always desired; but
he precedents are numerous of the admission of
eâ€¢tes into the Union without such submission.
It would not comport with my present purÂ­
,,,o: to review the proceedings of Congress upon
the Lecompton constitution. It is sufficient to
observe that their final action has removed the
last vestige of serious revolutionary troubles.Â­
The desperate band recently assembled, under
o notorious outlaw, in the southern portion of
the Territory, to resist the execution of the laws
â€¢ na to plunder peaceful citizens, will, I doubt
,;t, be speedily subdued and brought to justice.
HIad I treated the Lecompton constitution as a
ullity and refused to transmit it to Congress, it
is not diliheult to imagine, whilst recalling the
poition of1' the country at that moment, what
Im,ld have been the disastrous consequences, 1
1oth"" in and out of the Territory, from such a
,i(.liction of duty on the part of the Executive.
l'eace has also been restored within the territory I
of t'tah, which, at the cnumnencoment of my
:dminisJrtion, was in ai state of open rebellion.
'[his was the more dang irous, as the people, aniÂ­
n Isd by a fanatical spirit and entrenched within
heir distant mountain fastnesses, might have
;:::de a long and formidable resistance. Cost
shat it might, it was necessary to bring them into I
stl jeetion to the constitution and the laws.Â­ t
ieand policy, therefore, as well as humanity, reÂ­ I
, uired that this object should, if possible, be acÂ­
,mpilished without the effusion of blood. This
,,iid only be effected by sending a military force
:. the territory sufficiently strong to convince
: e people that resistance would be hopeless, and
:he same time to offer them a pardon for past
fiÂ·'nces on condition of immediate submission to
s:e government. This policy was pursued with
,nin.ent success; and the only cause for regret i. t
ite heavy expenditure required to march a large
ietachment of the army to that remote region and
:. rnish it subsistence. Utah is now compareÂ­ I
tiveiy peaceful and quiet, and the military force
!as been withdrawn, except that portion of it
secessary to keep tile Indians in check and to proÂ­
:c: the emigrant trains on their way to our PaÂ­
l
h;u possessiono. d
FINANCES.
In my lirst annual message I promised to employ t
: ibest exertions., in co-operation with Congress, to g
rluae the expenditures of the Government within the t
limiu W "" a wise aud judicious economy. An overÂ­ o
't wing treasury had produced habits of prodigality c
sand extravagance which could only be gradually corÂ­ n
ree:ed. The work required both time and patience. I
iappiiud myself diligently to this task from the beÂ­ o
ginning, and was aided by the able and energetic efÂ­
frts of the Heads of the different Executive DepartÂ­ e
uen-c. The result of our labors in this good cause d
didl nt appear in the sum total of our expenditures
t,.r thaeirst two years, mainly in consequence of the n
extraor:linary expenditure necessarily incurred in the u
Utah expedition, and the very large amount of the ii
ontiungeit expenses of Congress during this period. 2
These greatly oxceded the pay and mileage of the o
maier.ers. For the year ending 30th Juno,lS5S,whilst it
the pay and mileage amounted to $1,460,214, the con ti
tingent expenses role to $2,093,309 79, and for the b
year ending 30th June, 1859, whilst the pay and mil. s
cage amounted to $859,093. G6, the contingent expenÂ­ P
ses amounted to $1,431,565 78. I am happy, howÂ­ n
ever, ts be able to inform you that during the last fisÂ­ a
cal year ending on the 30th June, 1880, the total exÂ­ i
poenditures of the Government in all its branches-Â­ r
legi.slative, executive, and judicial-exclusive of the t
public debt, were reduced to the sum of $55, 402,466Â­
4. This conclusively appears from the books of the
Treasury. In the year ending on the 30th June, 1858,
the total expenditure, exc!usive of the public debt,
smouanted to $71,001,129 77, and that fir the year t
ending 30th June, 1859, to $60,348,226 13. Whilst
tie hooks of the Treasury show an actual expenditure
',f $50,848, 474 72 for the year ending on the 30th
June,160, including $1,040,667 71 for the contingent
expenses of Congress,there must be deducted from this
ismount the suns of $4.296,009 2 , with the interest


up,on it of $lO0,000, appropriated'hy the act of 15th
February, 1860, ""for the purpose of supplying the doÂ­ r
:ioiency in the revenues and defraying the expenses ,
of the Post Office Department for the year ending the ,
thirtieth of June, one thousand eight hundred and fifÂ­
ty-nine. ' This sum, therefore, justly chargeable to t
hoe year 1859, n ust be deducted from the sum of $59,Â­
';1,17-t4 72, in order to ascertain the expenditure for t
the year ending on the 30th June, 1860, which leaves
a balance for the expenditures of that year of 55,402,
465 46. The interest on the public debt, including
fressury notes for the same fiscal year ending on the
:bth June, 1S60, amounted to $3,177,314 62, which,
.liled to the above sum of 55,402,465 46, makes the t
argregate of $5b,579,780 08.
It ought in justice to be observed that several of the e
estimates from the departments for the year ending t
;uth June, 1860, were reduced by Congress below what d
was and still is deemed compatible with the public inÂ­ r
terest. Allowing ahlberalmarginof 2,500,000 for this 8
red uction, and for other causes it may be safely assorÂ­
tad that the sum of $61,000,000, or at the most t
I62~,,000,000, is amply sufficient to adminisÂ­ t
ter the Government and to pay the interest
i' the public debt, unless contingent events should
hereafter render extraordinary expenditures necessary.
This result has been attained in a considerable do.
grce by the care exercised by the appropriate departÂ­
mInts in entering into public contracts. I have myÂ­
self never interfered with the. award of any such conÂ­
tract except in a single case with the Colonization SoÂ­
Siety, deeming it advisible to cast the whole responsiÂ­
bility in each case on the proper head of the departÂ­
mIent, with the general instruction that these conÂ­
tracts should always be given to tlhe lowest and best
ildder. It has ever be en my opinion that public conÂ­
trarts are not a legitimate source of patronage to be
Snfrered upon personal or political favorites; but that
io all such cases a public officer is hound to act for the
Govcrnment as a prudent individual would act for
Iimself.
AFRICcAN ;LAVE Tn.ADE., &C.
It is with great satisfaction I communicate the fact,
that, since the date of my last Annual Message, not a
Airgle slave has been imported into the United States
in violai:on of the laws prohibiting the African slave
trade. This statement is founded upon Sa thorough
exam:ination and investigation of the subject. Indeed,
the e:pirit which prevailed some time since among a
itrtion of our fellow-citizens in favor of this trade
ceeams to have entirely subsided.
I also congratulate you upon the public sentiment
whiich now exists against the crime ofsetting on foot
military expeditions within the limits of the United
Otates to proceed from thence and makenwar upon the
people of unoffending States, with whom we are at
,eoc. In this respect a happy change has been ofÂ­
icrted since the commencement of my Administration.
it surely oughtto be the praylr of every Christian
ald patriot, that such expeditions may never again
rcereive countenance in our country or depart from
oiur shores.
it would be a useless repetition to do more than reÂ­
l:ir, ith earnest commendation, to my former recomÂ­
lIiindl:tions in fa!vor of the Pacific railroad-of the
grant of power to the President to employ the naval
.:c in the vicinity, for the protection of the lives and
property of our fcllow-citizens passing in transit over
lie different Central American routes, against sudden
anti lawless outbreaks and depredations; and also to
l-r:etect American merchant vessels, their crews and
rergues, against violent and unlawful'seizure and conÂ­
tieantiotn in the ports of Mexico and the Soustlh Amer.
ican relublies, when these may be in a disturbed and
revolutionary condition. It is my settled conviction,
lhat without such a power we do not afford that proÂ­
tection to those engaged in the commerce of the
c ,artry which they have a right to demand.
ELECTION OF :,rcalniRS O COOGREss.
_ again recommend to Congress the passage of t


rÂ­ law in pursuance of the provisions of the ConstituÂ­
A tion, appointing a day certain, previousto the 4th of
aÂ­ March, in each year of an odd number, for the delcÂ­
le tion of representatives throughout all the States.-Â­
uÂ­
A'similar power has already been exercised, with
id
general approbation, in the appointment of the same
day throughout the Union for holding the election of
n'
electors for President and Vice President of the
ry
United States. My attention was earnestly directed
tÂ­ to this subject from the fact, that the 35th Congress
le terminated on the 3rd of March, 1859, without makÂ­
.r.
ing the necessary appropriation for the service of the
Ig
Post Oftice Department. Iwas then forced to consid.
nÂ­
or the best remedy for this omission, and an immediÂ­
tn
ate call of the present Congress was the natural reÂ­
sort. Upon enquiry, however, I ascertained that fifÂ­
teen out of the 33 States composing the Confederacy
were without representatives, and that, consequently,
these fifteen States would be disfranchi4ed by such a
.Â­ call. These fifteen States will be in the same condiÂ­
eÂ­ tion on the 4th March next. Ten of them cannot
eÂ­
elect representatives, according to existing State
id laws, until different periods, extending from the beÂ­
n, ginning of August next until the months of October
1Â­ and November.
n In my last message I gave warning that, in a time
i of sudden and alarming danger, the salvation of our
is
institutions might depend upon the power of the
n
President immediately to assemble a full Congrees, to
meet the emergency.
S TARIFF.
It is now quite evident that the financial necessities
e of the Government will require a modification of the
it
tariff during your present session, for the purpose of
increasing the revenue. In this aspect, I desire to
reiterate the recommendation contained in my last
two annual messages, in favor of imposing specific
instead of ad ralerces duties on all imported articles
to which these can be properly applied. From long
e observation and experience I am convinced that speÂ­
*r
cific duties are necessary, both to protect the revenue
and to secure to our manufacturing interests that
e amount of incidental encouragement which unavoidÂ­
ably results from a revenue tariff.
t As an abstract proposition it may be admitted that
ad valorem duties would, in theory, be the most just
and equal. But if the experience of this and all othÂ­
ercommercisl nations has demonstrated that such
duties cannot be assessed and collected without great
n
frauds upon the revenue, then it is the part of wisÂ­
0 dom to resort to specific duties. Indeed, from the
o very nature of an ad aloremr duty, this must be the
- result. Under it the inevitable consequence is, that
r foreign goods will be entered at less than their true
,f value. The treasury will, therefore, lose the duty on
the difference between their real and fictitious value,
and to this extent we are defrauded.
The temptations which ad valorem duties present
to a dishonest importer are irresistible. His object
is to pass his goods through the custom-house at the
very lowest valuation necessary to save them from
confiscation. In this he too often succeeds in spite
t of the vigilance of the revenue officers. Hence the
, resort to false invoices, one for the purchaser and anÂ­
1
other for the custom-house, and to other expedients
to defraud the Government. The honest importer
produces his invoice to the collector, stating the acÂ­
tual price at which he purchased the articles abroad.
Not so the dishonest importer and the agent of the
foreign manufacturer. And here it may be observed
that a very largs, proportion of the manufactures imÂ­
ported from abroad are consigned for sale to commisÂ­
sion merchants who are mere agents employed by the
manufacturers. In such cases no actual sale has
been made to fix their value. The foreign manufacÂ­
turer, if he be dishonest, prepares an invoice of the
goods, not at their actual value, but at the very lowÂ­
est rate necessary to escape detection. In this manÂ­
ner the dishonest importer and the foreign manufacÂ­
turer enjoy a decided advantage over the honest merÂ­
chant. They are thus enabled to undersell the fair traÂ­
der, and drive him from the market. In fact, the
operation of this system has already driven from the
pursuits of honorable commerce many of that class
of regular and conscientious merchants, whose charÂ­
acter, throughout the world, is the pride of our counÂ­
try.
The remedy for these evils is to be found in specific
duties, so far as this may be practicable. They disÂ­
pense with any inquiry at the custom-house into the
actual cost or value of the article, and it pays the preÂ­
cise amount of duty previously fixed by law. They
present no temptations to the appraisers of foreign
goods, who receive but small salaries, and might, by r
undervalue on in a few cases, render themselves inÂ­
dependant.
Besides, specific duties best conform to the requisiÂ­
tion in the Constitution that ""no preference shall be 1
given by any regulation of commerce or revenue to
the ports of one State over tlose of another."" Under
our ad valorem system such preferences are to some r
extent inevitable, and complaints have often been X
made that the spirit of this provision has been vioÂ­
lated by a lower appraisement of the same articles at
one port than at another.
An impression strangely enough prevails to some
extent that specific duties are necessarily protective
duties. Nothing can be more fallacious. Great 2
Britain glories in free trade, and yet her whole roveÂ­
nue from imports is at the present moment collected
under a system of specific duties. It is a striking fact
in this connection that, in the commercial treaty of
23d January, 1860, between France and England, one
of the articles provides that the ad caloremn duties
which it imposes shall be converted into specific duÂ­
ties within six months from its date, and these are to
be ascertained by making an average of the prices for
six months previous to that time. The reverse of the
proposition would be nearer to the truth, because a
much larger amount of revenue would be collected by
merely converting the ad valtoreus duties of a tariff
into equivalent specific duties. To this extent the
revenue would be increased, and in the same proporÂ­
tion the specific duty might be diminished.
Specific duties would secure to the American manÂ­
ufacturer the incidental protection to which he is
fairly entitled under a revenue tariff, and to this sureÂ­
ly no person would object. The framers of the exisÂ­
ting tariff have gone fitrther, and in a liberal spirit
have discrimninated in favor of large and useful
branches of our manufactures, not by raising the rate
of duty upon the importation of similar articles from
abroad, but what is the same in effect, by admitting (
articles free of duty which enter into the composition


i at uneir arlics.
Under the present system it has been often truly
remarked that this incidental protection decreases
when the manufacturer needs it most, and increases
when he needs it least, and c nstitutes a sliding scale
which always operates against him. The revenues of 1
the country are subject to similar fluctuation. InÂ­ t
stead of approaching a steady standard, as would be
the case under a system of specific duties, they sink
and rise with the sinking and rising prices of articles
in foreign countries. It would not be difficult for
Congress to arrange a system of specific duties which
would afford additional stability both to our revenue
and our manufactures, and without injury or injustice -
to any interest of the country. This might be accomÂ­
plished by ascertaining the average value of any givÂ­
en article for a series of years at the place of exportaÂ­
tion, and by simply converting the rate of ad valorem
duty upon it which might be deemed necessary for i
revenue purposes, into the form of a specific duty.Â­
Such an arrangement could not injure the consumer.
If he should pay a greater amount of duty one year,
this would be counterbalanced by a lesser amount
the next, and in the end the aggregate would be the
same.
I desire to call your immediate attention to the
present condition of the Treasury, so ably and clearly
presented by the Secretary in his report to Congress;
and to recommend, that measures he promptly adoptÂ­
ed, to enable it to discharge its pressing obligationsu
The other recommendations of the report are well
worthy of your favorable consideration.
I herewith transmit to Congress the reports of the
Secretaries of War, of the Navy, of the Interior and
of the Postmaster General. The recommendations
and suggestions which they contain are highly valÂ­
uÂ­ ble and deserve your careful attention.
The report of the Postmaster General details the
t circumstances under which Cornelius Vanderbilt, on
my request, agreed, in the month of July last, to carÂ­
'
ry the ocean mails between our Atlantic and Pacific
coasts. IInd he not thus acted, this important interÂ­
communication must have been suspended, at least
for a season. The Postmaster General had no power
to make him any other compensation than the postÂ­
ages on the mail matter which he might carry. It
was known, at the time, that these postages would
fall far short of an adequate compensation, as well as
of the sum which the same service had previously
cost the Government. Mr. Vanderbilt, in a commendÂ­
8 able spirit, was willing to rely upon the justice of
Congress to makeup the deficiency; and I, therefore,
recommend that an appropriation may be granted for
t this purpose.
d
I should do great injustice to the Attorney GeneÂ­
0 ral, were I to omit the mention of his distinguished
st ervices in the measures adopted and prosecuted by
him for the defence of the Government against nuÂ­
merous and unfounded claims to land in California,
n
purporting to have been made by the Mexican govÂ­
n ernment previous to the treaty of cession. The sucÂ­
n cessful opposition to these claims has saved to -the
United States public property worth many millions
of dollars, and to individuals holding title under
them to at least an equal amount.
It has been represented to me, from sources which
1 Ideem reliable, that the inhabitants in several porÂ­
d tions of Kansas have been reduced nearly to a state of
or
starvation, on account of the almost total failure of
n their crops, whilst the harvests in every other portion
to
of the country have been abundant. The prospect
before them for the approaching winter is well calcuÂ­
lated to enlist the sympathies of every heart. The
.r destitution appears to be so general that it cannot be
bd
relieved by private contributions, and they are in
such indigent circumstances as to be unable to purÂ­
chase the necessaries of life for themselves. I refer
he the subject to Congress. If any constitutional raeasÂ­
ure for their relief can be devised I would recommend
its adoption.
I cordially commend to your favorable regard the
d intere-ts of the people of this District. They are




 eminently entitled to your consideration, especially
since, unlike the people of the States, they can appeal
to no Government except that of the Union.

fortitude of one whose whole life has been a round
of pleasure? lier gay spirits might revolt at the
dark downward path of low humility suddenly lP
pointed out before her, and might cling to the
sunny regions in which they had hitherto revelled. A 1

by so many galling mortifications to which in othebir 4to

Seo her pallid countenance, but a short timo

the school and the pride of the household. ShoÂ­

her lithe form and pleasing disposition carried
choerfulness into their ranks. Diligent, punc?

are sorrowed. Those rosy cheeks and ruddy
lips are blanched by Consumption. The voiceÂ­

us approach- her couch gently and take her

President Cleveland.
Washington, Dec. 3.-The following is
the full text of President Cleveland's
message to congress:
To the Congress of the United States:
The present assemblage of the legislative
body of our government occurs at a time
when the interests of our people and
the needs of the country give especial
prominence to the condition of our forÂ­
eign relations and the exigencies of our
national finance. The reports of the
beads of the several administrative deÂ­
partments of the government fully and
plainly exhibit what has been accomÂ­
plished within the score of the respective
duties and present each recommendations
for the betterment of our country's conÂ­
dition as patriotic and intelligent labor
and observation suggest.
I, therefore, deem my executive duty
adequately performed at this time by
presenting to the congress the important
phases of our situation as related to our
intercourse with foreign nations, and a
statement of the financal problems which
confront us, omitting, except as they are
related to these topics, any reference to
department operations. I earnestly nÂ­
vlte, however, not only the careful conÂ­
sideration, but the severely critical
scrutiny of the congress and my fellosÂ­
countrymen to the reports concernlng
these departmental operations. If justly
and fairly examined they will furnish
proof of assiduous and painlstaling cars
for the public welfare. I press the
recommendatlons they contain upon the
respectful attention of those charged
with the duty of legislation, because I
believe their adoption would promote the
people's good.
FREE WOOL.
By dmendatory tariff legislation in JanÂ­
uary last the Argentine Republic, recogÂ­
nizlng the value of the large market
opened to the free importation of its
wools under our last tariff act. has adÂ­
mitted products of the United States to
entry at reduced duties. It is pleasing
to note that the efforts we have made to
enlarge the exchanges of trade on a
esound basis of mutual benefit are In this
instance appreciated by the country from
which our woolen factories draw their
needful supply of raw material.
BRAZILIAN BOUNDARY.
The Missions boundary dispute between
the Argentine Repobllir and Brazil reÂ­
ferred to the president of the United
States as arbitrator during the term of
my predecessor, and which was submitted
to me for determination, resulted in an
award in favor of Brazil upon the hisÂ­
torical and documentary evidence preÂ­
sented, thus ending a long-protracted
controversy and natain demonstrating the
wisdom and desirability of settlltag InterÂ­
national boundary disputes by recourse
to friendly eirbltratlon.
Negotlatlont are progressing for a reÂ­
vival of tiheUnited States and ChSlllan

expiration of the stipulated time wlthin

THIE CRINESE WAR.

between Chins and Japan, while rslievÂ­

meat from the delicate duty they nnderÂ­
took at the request of both countries of
reondlrlig secll service to the subjects of
either belligerent twith tlie t-erritorlal
limits of asrh otheti as oar iEutralI poslÂ­
tion permitted, developed a douest:e cosÂ­
dittos In the Chinrese empire whltis has
caused much anxiety and callod for
prompt and careful attenion. Either as
the result of a werli coiitrol In the cenÂ­
gral government over the provincial ndÂ­
mlnlisratlon. followisnig a dlllniutun of
trodlilonal govetrnmwental authority sadar
the stceus of an overwlbeimlog national
disaster, or as a ma-nlfestitlon uprn good
opportunity of the aversion of the ChiÂ­
neso population to all foreign ways and




 undertaklngs, there have occurred In
widely separated provinces of China
SERIOUS OUTBREAKS
of the old fanatical spirit against forÂ­
eigners, which. ur.ehecl~ed by the local
authorities. if not actually connived at
by them, have culminated in mob attacks
on foreign missionaries, causing much
destruction of property and attended with
personal Injuries as well as with the loss
of life.
Although but one American citizen
vwas reported to have been actually
wounded, and although she destruction
of property may have fallen more hasvlly
upon the islsionaries of ather naiollonaliÂ­
ties than our or;n, it plainly proves that
this governmlet meant to rake the most
prompt and decided a tlon to guard
against similar or perha'psP more dreadful
calamities befalling the hundreds of
American mission statitons which have
grown up thlroughout the interior of
China under the temperate rule of toleraÂ­
tion, custom. and inlperial edict. The
demands of the United States and other
powers for the degradation and punishÂ­
ment of the responsible officials of the
respective citles and provinces who, by
neglect or otherwise, had permitted upÂ­
risings and for the adoption of stern
measures by tile emperor's government
for the protection for the life and propÂ­
erty of foreigaers, were followed by the
disgrace and dismissal of certain proÂ­
vincial officials found derelict in duty and
the punislhment by death of a number of
those adjudged guilty of actual partlclÂ­
pnatloh In tile oltrages.
This government also Insisted that a
special American commission should visit
the province where the first disturbances
occurred for the purpose of investigation.
'This latter commission, after much
opposition, has gone overland from
Tles-Tsln, accompanied by a suitable
Chinese escort, and, by its demonstraÂ­
tion of the readiness and ability of our
government to protect its citizens, will
act, it Is believed, as a most influential
deterent of any similar outbreak. The
energetic steps we have thus taken are
all the more likely to result in future
safety to our citizens In China, because
the imperial government is, I am perÂ­
suaded to believe, entirely convinced that
we desire only the liberty and protection
of our own citizens and redress for any
wrongs they may have suffered, and that
we have no ulterior designs or objects,
political or otherwise. China will not forÂ­
get either our kindly service to her citiÂ­
zens during her late war, or the further
fact that, while furnishing all the faciliÂ­
ties at our command to further the neÂ­
gotiations of peace between her and Japan.
we sought no advantages and interposed
no counsel. The governments of both
China and Japan have In special disÂ­
patches transmitted, through their respecÂ­
tive diplomatic representatives, expressed
In a most pleasing manner their grateful
appreciation of our assistance to their
citizens during the unhappy struggle, and
of the value of our aid in paving the way
to their resumption of peaceful relations.
THE WALLER CASE.
The customary cordial relations be
tween this country and France have been
undisturbed, with"" the exception that a
full explanation of the treatment of John
L. Waller by the expeditionary military
authorities of France still remains to be
given. Mr. Waller, formerly United
States consul at Tomatave, remained in
Madagascar after his term of office exÂ­
pired, and was apparently successful in
procuring business concessions from the
Horse of - greater ..or less ailue. After
the occupation - of Tametave and the
declaration of martial law by the French,
he seas arrested upon' various charges,
among them that of communicating miliÂ­
tary information to the enemies of
rance,. was tried and convicted by a miliÂ­
tary tribunal, and sentenced to twenty
years' imprisonment. Following the
course iustilled by abunlanr precedents.
tis government requested from that of
France the record of the proceedings of
the French tribunal which resulted in
Mr. Waller's condemnation. This request
has been compiled wlth to the extent of
supplying a copy of the ofilcinl record,
from which appear the constitution and
organization of the court; the charges,
as formutated, Pr d the general course and
resttit of the trial, and-by which It is
shown that the accused was tried in open
court and was defended by counsel. But
the evidence adduced In support of the
charges, which was not received by the
French minister for foreign affairs till
the first week in October, has thus far
been withheld, the French government
talking the ground that Its production In
response to our demand would establish
a bad precedent. The efforts of our amÂ­
bassador to procure it, however, though
impeded by recent changes In the French
ministry. have not been relaxed, and It
is confidently expected that some satisÂ­
factory solution of the matter will shortly
be reached. MIeanwhlle. it appears that
Mr. Waller's confinement has every alÂ­
leviation which the state of his health
and all the other circumstances of the
case demand or permit. '
THE PARIS EXPOSITION.
In agreeable contrast to the difference
above noted respecting a matter of comÂ­
mon concern, where nothing Is sought exÂ­
cept such a mutually satisfactory outÂ­
come as the true merits of tihe case reÂ­
quire, is the recent resolution of the
French chambers favoring the conclusion
of a permanent treaty of arbitration heÂ­
tween the two countries. An Invitation
hbs been extended by France to the govÂ­
ernment and people of the United States
to participate in a great Insternationil exÂ­
positlpgn at Paris in 1000. as a suitable
commemoration of the close of this, the
r
world's marvelous century of progress.
I heartily recommend its acceptance, toÂ­
gether with such legislation as will
adequately provide for a due representaÂ­
tion of this government and its people on
the occasion. GERtIANY.
Our relations with the German empire
are, in some aspects, typical of a condiÂ­
tion of things elsewhere found in countries
whose productions and trades are similar
to our own. The close rivalries of compeÂ­
tition industries; the influenceÂ­ of the
Sdelusive doctrine that the internal deÂ­
velopment of a nation is promoted and
its wealth increased by a policy which In
undertaking to reserve its home markets
for the exclusive use of its own producers
necessarily obstructs their sales In foreign
markets and prevents free access to the
products of the world, the desire to retain
trade In time-worn ruts, regardless of the
inexorable laws of new needs and changed
condition of demand nod supply, and our
own tardiness in inviting a freer exchange
of commodities, imperiling our footing In
the external markets naturally open to
us, have created a situation somewhat InÂ­
Sjurious to American export Interests, not
only in Germany, where they are perhaps
most noticeable, but in adjacent countries.
The exports affected are largely AmeriÂ­
can cattle and other food products, the
reason assigned for unfavorable discrimiÂ­
nation being that their consumption is
deleterious to the public health. This is
Sall the more irritating In view of the
fact that no European state is as jealous
of the excellence and witolesomeness of
its exported food supplies of. the United
States, nor so easily able, on account of
inherent soundness, to guarantee those
qualites. Nor are these difficulties confined
to our food products designed for exportsÂ­
t|0n. Our great insurance companies, for
example, hvilng btilt tip a vast bustsiss
- abroad and Issv.sted a large share of their
gains In forelga countries in compliance
with the local laws and regulations then
exIsting, now find themselves within a
narrowing circle of onerous and unforeÂ­
seen conditions. and are confronted by
the necessity of retirement from a leld
thus made unproitable. if indeed they
sre not summarily expelled, as some of
lIhem have lately been from Prussla. It Is
ont to be forgotten that international
I trade causot be one-sided. Its currents
are alternating, and its movements should
be honestly relproc:lte. Without this it
almost necessarily degenerates Into a deÂ­
vice to gain advantage or a contrlvance
to secure bsenets with only the semblance
of a return. In our dealings with Other
nations we ought to be open-handed and
scrupulously fair. This should be our
policy nssu producing nation, and it plainÂ­
I ly becomes us as a people who love genÂ­
i cuoslty and the moral aspects of national
g.sd faith and reciprocal forbearance.
I These considerations should not, however,

 constrailn us to submit to unfair discrimiÂ­
nation nor to silently acquiesce In vexÂ­ a
atalous hindrances to the enjoyment of our a
share of the legitimate advantages ofC
proper trade relations. If an examinationt
of the situation suggests such measures
on our part as would involve restrictionso
similar to those from which we suffer,
the way to such a course Is easy. It t
should, however. by no means he lightly
eutwred upon, since the necessity for the
Intuguration of such a policy would be tÂ­
regretted by the best sentiment of oun,
people, and because it naturally and logi-t
cally might lead to consequences of the
gravest character.
THE KIEL CANAL.
I take pleasure In calling to your atten
tlon the encomiums bestowed on those 1
vessels of our new navy which took part t
In the notable ceremony of the opening
of the Kiel canal. It was fitting that this
extruordinary achlevemseut of the newer
German nationality should be celebrated
in the presence of America's exposition
of the latest developments of the world's
naval energy.
GREAT BRITAIN.
Our relations with Great Britain, always
intimate and important, have demanded
during the past year even a greater shire
of consideration than is usual. Several
vexatious questions were left undeterÂ­
mined by the decision of the Behrilng sea
arbitration tribunal. The application of
the principles laid down by that august
body has not been followed by the reÂ­
sults they were intended to accomplish,
because their execution has been
more or less Imperfect. Much corresÂ­
iondence has been exchanged betweeu the
two governments on the subject of preÂ­
venting the exterminating slaughter of
seals.
Insufficiency of the British patrol of
the Behrlng sea, under the regulations
agreed on by the two governments, has
been pointed out, and yet only two British
ships have been on police duty during this
season in those vwaters.
The need of a morn effective enforceÂ­
ment of existing regulations, as well as
the adoption of such additional regulaÂ­
lions as experience has shown to be absoÂ­
lutely necessary to carry out the intent
of the award, nave been earnestly urged
upon the British government, but taus
far without effective results. In the meannÂ­
time the depletion of the seal herds by
means of pelagcl hunting has so ularmingÂ­
ly progressed that unless their slaughter
is at once effectively checked their exÂ­
tinction within a fewv years seems to be a
matter of absolute certainty.
The understanding by which the United
States was to pay, and Great Britain to
receive, a lump sum of 5425,000 in full
settlement of all British claims for daumÂ­
ages arising from our seizure of British
sealing vessels unauthorized under the
award of the Paris tribunal of arbitration
was not confirmed by the last congress,
which declined to make the necessary upÂ­
propriation. I am still of the opinion
that this arrangement was a judicious
and advantageous one for the government,
and I earnestly recommend that it be
again considered and sanctioned. If
this, however, does not meet with the
favor of congress, It certainly will hardly
dissent from the proposition that the govÂ­
ernment Is bound by every considerallon
of honor and good faith to provide for
the speedy adjustment of these claims by
arbitration as the only other alternative;
a treaty of arbitration has therefore been
agreed upon, and wvill be immediately
laid before the senate, so that In one of
thelq mQdes uggested final settlement may
be-reached. - -.
Notwithstanding that Great Britain
originated the proposal to enforce interÂ­
national rules for the prevention of colÂ­
lisions at sea, based on the recommendaÂ­
tions of the marine conference of WashÂ­
Ington and concurred In, suggesting
SMarch 1, 1895. as the date to be set by
proclamation for carrying these rules inÂ­
to actual effect, her majesty's governÂ­
ment, having encountered opposition on
the part of British shipping interests. anÂ­
nounced its inability to accept that date,
which was consequently canceled. The
entire matter is still in abeyance, withÂ­
out prospect of a better condition in the
near future.
The commissioners nppointed to make
the international boundary in PassarÂ­
quoddy bay according to the description
of the treaty of Ghent have not yet fully
agreed.
The completion of the preliminary surÂ­
vey of that Alaskan boundary which folÂ­
lows the contour of the coast from the
southernmost point of Prince of Wales
island until it strikes the 141st meridian
at or near the summit of Mount St. Elius
calls for further necessary appropriatlon,
which Is urgently recommended. This
1
survey was undertaken under the proviÂ­
slons of the convention entered Into by
this country and Great Britain July 22,
1892. and the supplementary convention
of Feb. 3. 1894. As to the remaining secÂ­
tion of the Alaskan boundary which folÂ­
lows the 141st meridian northwardly from
Muonnt St. Elias to the frozen ocean, the
settlement of which involves tie physical
location of the meridian mentioned, no
conventional agreement husyet been made.
The ascertainment of a given meridian at i
a particular point is a work requiring
much time and careful observation and
surveys. Such observations and surveys It
were undertaken by the United States
Scoast and geodetic survey in 1890 and
t1801,
while similar work in the same
quarters under British auspices are beÂ­
tlieved
to give nearly coincident result.
but these surveys have been independentÂ­ I
a ly conducted and no international agreeÂ­
ment to mark those or any other parts of
the 141st meridian by permanent monuÂ­ I
a ments has yetbeen made. In the meanÂ­
time the valley of the Yukon Is becoming
a highway through the hitherto unesÂ­
plored wilds of Alnaska and abundant minÂ­
eral wealth has been discovered in that
tregion,
especially at or near the junction
of the boundary meridian with the
Yukon and Its tributaries. Under these
a circumstances, It Is expedient and indeed
imperative that the jurisdictional limits
s
of the respective governments In this new
r
region be speedily determined. Mer
Britannic majesty's government has proÂ­
posed a Joint delimitation of the 141st
meridian by an international commission
Sof experts, which, if. congress will authorÂ­
SIze
It and make due provision therefor,
s
can be accomplished with no unreasonÂ­
s
able delay. It is impossible to overlook
the vital importance of continuing the
work already entered Upon,. and suppleÂ­
Smenting
it by further effective measures
looking to the exact location of this enÂ­
Stire boundary line.

limitation of the respective jurisdlctions

VENEZUELAN BOUNDARY.

dispute between Great Britain and the
republic of Venezaela concernltng the
S limits of British Guinato, was iapproachÂ­
a Ing an acute stage, a definite statement
of the interest asid policy of the Unitesd

ElA l'lONS W'VITIi GR EAT B RIT..!'
-cal iPatrol-Alnskan Iloundary and the
Venezuelan Dispute.
Our relations with Great Pritain, nIÂ­
ways intimate and important, have dfÂ­
manded during the past year a greate'r
share of consideration than is usual. StvÂ­
Irnl vexatious questions were left undetorÂ­
amined by the decision of tile Blering sea
arbitration tribunal. The applicationi of
the principles laid down by that august
body has not been followed by the results
they were intended to accomnplish, either
tbecause the principrles themnselves lacked
ii breadth andl deflinitenless, or becauitse
their execution has been more or less
impelrfect. iMuch correspondence has
been exchanged between the two governÂ­
ments on the subject of preventing the
exterminating slaughter of seals. The
insuficioeney of British patrol of Bering
sea under the regulations agreed on by
the two governments has been pointed out
and yet only two British ships have been
on police during this season in these waÂ­
ters. The need of a more effective en,
foriement of existing regulations, as well
as the adoption of such additional reguÂ­
lations as experience has shown to be
absolutely necessary urged upon the BritÂ­
ish government, but thus far without efÂ­
fective results. In the meantime the dsiÂ­
piletion of the seal herds, by means of
Ipelagic hurntinrg, has so harmfully proÂ­
grossed that unless their slaughter is at
once checked their extinction within a
few years seems to be a matter of absoÂ­
lute certainty.
The undcrstanding by w-hich thie United
States was to pay and Great Britain to
receive a lump sum of $425,000O in full setÂ­
tlement o& all British claims for damages
arising from our seizure of British sealÂ­
ing vessels unauthorized under the award
of the Paris tribunal of arbitration, was
not confirmed by the last congress. which
declined to make the necessary appropriaÂ­
tion. I am still of the opinion that this
arrangement was a judicious and advanÂ­
tageous one for the government, and I
earnestly recommend that it be again conÂ­
sidered and sanctioned. If. however, this
does not meet with the favor of congress,
it certainly will hardly dissent from the
proposition that the government is bound
by every consideration of honor and good
faith to provide for the speedy adjustment
of these claims by arbitration as the only
other alternative. A treaty of arbitration
has therefore been agreed upon and will
be immediately laid before the senate
so that in one of the modes suggested
a final settlement may be reached.
Notw-ithstanding that Great Britain
originated the proposal that there be enÂ­
forced international rules for the prevenÂ­
Stion of collision at sea, based on the recÂ­
ommendations of the maritime conferÂ­

at. ence of Washington and concurred in,
id- stggesting March ., 1895, as the date to
ed be set by proclamation for carrying these
he rules into general effect, her majesty's
ch government, having encountered opposiÂ­
>n. tion on the part of British shipping interÂ­
to ests, announced its inability to accept the
he "" findings of the conference, which was conÂ­
he sequently cancelled. The entire matter
he is still in abeyance, without prospect of a
he better condition in the near future.

:er ALASKAN SURVEY.
in The completion of the preliminary surÂ­
he vey of that Alaskan boundary which folÂ­
nd lows the contour of the coast from the
le- southernmost point of Prince of Wales
at. island until it strikes the 141st meridian
re at or near the summit of 'Mount St. Elias,
nt awaits further necessary appropriations,
ve which is urgently recommended.
fly This survey was undertaken under the
on provisions of the convention entered inÂ­
Å½d. to by this country and Great Britain July
rs ""2, 1892, and the supplementary convenÂ­
ch tion of February 3, 1894. As to the remainÂ­
ier ing section of the Alaskan boundary,
wr- which follows the 141st meridian northÂ­
if- wardly from Mount St. Elias to the frozen
:er ocean, the settlement of which involves
is the physical location of the meridian menÂ­
tc- tioned, no conventional agreement has yet
he been made.
eh The ascertainment of a given meridian
a at a particular point is work requiring
en much time and careful observations and
surveys. Such observations and surveys
by were undertaken by the United States
of coast and geodetic survey in 1891 and 1891,
at while similar work in the same quarters
tr, under British auspices are believed to
se give nearly coincident results, but these
of surveys have been independently conductÂ­
i- rd and no international agreement to
on mark those or any other parts of the
p- 141st meridian by permanent monuments
its has yet been made.
In the meantime, the valley of the YuÂ­
kon is becoming a highway through the
hitherto unexplored wilds of Alaska.
Abundant mineral wealth has been discovÂ­
ered in that region, especially at or near
the junction of the boundary meridian
with the Yukon and its tributaries. In
he these circumstances it is expedient, inÂ­
'- deed imperative, that the jurisdictional
re limits of the respective governments has
II proposed a joint delimitation of the 141st
se meridian by an international commission
in of expcrts, which, if congress will auÂ­
he thorize it and make due provision thereÂ­
o- for, can he accomplished with no unreaÂ­
- ;onalde delays.
ui It is impossible to overlook the vital imÂ­
' yort-pance of continuing the work already
le entered upon and supplementing it by
further effective measures looking to the
e- exact location of this entire boundary
ts line.
w I call attention to the unsatisfactory
e- delimitation of the respective jurisdictions
I of the United States and the Dominion of
of Canada in the great lakes and the apÂ­
i- piroaches to the narrow waters that conÂ­
ts nect them. The waters in question are
t- frequented by fishermen of both nationÂ­
n alities and their nets are here used. Owing
to the uncertainty and ignorance as to the
e, true bocundary vexatious disputes and inÂ­
jurious seizures of boats and nets by
- Canadian cruisers often occur, while any
e positive settlement thereof by an acÂ­
cptclcitd standard is not easily to be reachÂ­
n .d. A joint commission to determine the
line in these quarters on a practical basis,
1e by measured courses following range
n marks on shore is a necessity for which
immediale provision should be made.
of VE;NEZUELAN QUESTION.
It being apparent that the boundary disÂ­
- pute between Great Britain and the reÂ­
public of Venezuela concerning the limits
of British Guiana was approaching an
acute state, a definite statement of the
interest and policy of the United States as
regards the controversy seemed to be reÂ­
quired both on its own account and in
view of its relations with the friendly
r_ powers directly concerned.
In July last, therefore, a dispatch was
at addressed to our ambassador at London
if for communication to the British governÂ­
ment in which the attitude of the United
, States was fully and distinctly set forth.
r- The general conclusions therein reached
Lt and formulated are in substance that the
e_ traditional and established policy of this
government is firmly opposed to a forciÂ­
ble increase by any European power of
,e its territorial possessions on this contiÂ­
h nent; that this policy is as well founded in
ir principle as it is strongly supported by
o numerotus presidents; that as a conseÂ­
quence the United States is bound to proÂ­
test against the enlargement of area of
a 11ritish Guinea in derogation of the rights
11 and against the will of Venezuela; that,
considering the disparity in the strength
is of Great Britain and Venezuela, the
:o territorial dispute between them can be
i- reasonably settled only by friendly, imÂ­
s ipartHal arbitration and the resort to such
arbitration should include the whole conÂ­
. troversy and is not satisfied if one of
a the powers concerned is permitted to draw
s an arbitrary line through the territory in
:e debate and to declare that it will submit
i to arbitration only the portion lying on
y one side of it. In view of these concluÂ­
e sions, the dispatch in question called upon
if the British government for a definite anÂ­
c swer to the question whether it would
Ssubmit the teritorial controversy between
o itself and Venezuela in Its entirety to imÂ­
ipartial arbitration. The answer of the
1- British government has not yet been reÂ­
a ceived but is expected shortly, when furÂ­
t ther communication on thie subject will
pirobabily be made to congress.

Inited States Interfered to Save the
lives of Men Unjustly Condemned.
Early in January last an uprising
against the government of Hawaii was
promptly suppressed. Martial law was
forthwith proclaimed and n',merous arÂ­
rests were made of persor.s suspected of
being in sympathy with the royalist party.
Among these were several citizens of the
United States wiho were einer convicted
by a. military court and sentenced to
death, imprisonment or fine, or were deÂ­
ported without trial. The United States,
while denying protection to such as had
taken the Hawaiian oath of allegiance,
insisted that martial law, though alterÂ­
ing the forms of justice, could not superÂ­
cede justice itself and demand a stay of
execution until the proceedings had been
submitted to this government and knowlÂ­
edge obtained therefrom that our citiÂ­
zens had received fair trial. The death
sentences were subsequently commuted
or were remitted on conditions of leavÂ­
ing the islands. The cases of certain
Americans arrested and expelled by arbiÂ­
trary orders without formal charges or
trial have attention and some instances
have found to justify remonstrance and a
claim for indemnity which Hawaii has
not thus far conceded.
Mr. Thurston, the Hawaiian minister,
having furnished this government abunÂ­
dant reason for asking that he be recalled,
that course was pursued and his sucÂ­
cessor has lately been-received.
ITALIAN LYNCHING.
The deplorable lynching of several ItalÂ­
ian laborers in Colorado was naturally
followed by international representations
and I am happy to say that the best efÂ­
forts of the state in which the outrages
occurred have been put forth to discover
and punish the authors of this atrocious
crime. The dependent families of some
of the unfortunate victims invite by their
deplorable condition, gracious provision
for their needs.
The manifestations against helpless
aliens may be traced through successive
stages to the vicious padroni system,
which, unchecked by our immigration and
Icontract labor statutes, control these
workers from the moment of landing on
our shores and farms them out in disÂ­
tant and often rude regions where their
sharpening competition in the fields of
bread winning toil brings them into colÂ­
lision with other labor interests. While
welcoming as we should those who seek
our shores to merge themselves in our
body politic and win personal competence
by honest effort, we can not regard such
an assemblage of distinctively alien laÂ­
borers. hired out to speculators and shipÂ­
ped hither and thither as the prospect of
gain may dictate as otherwise than repugÂ­
nant to the spirit of our civilization, deÂ­
terrent to individual advancement and
hinderances to the building up of stable

commodities, resting upon the wholesome
ambitions of the citizens and constituting
e the prime factor in the prosperity and
s progress of our nation. If legislation can
- reach this growing evil it certainly should
- be attempted.
e RELATIONS WITH JAPAN.
Japan has furnished abundant evidence
r of her vast gain in every trait and charÂ­
' acteristic that constitutes a nation's
greatness. We have reason for congratuÂ­
r lations in the fact that the government of
the United States by the exchange of
liberal treaty stipulations with the new
Japan, was the first to recognize her wonÂ­
derful advance and to extend to the conÂ­
sideration and confidence due to her naÂ­
tional enlightment and progressive charÂ­
acter.
The boundary dispute which lately
s threatened to embroil Guatemala and
1 Mexico has happily yielded to pacific counÂ­
sels and its determination has by the joint
agreement of the parties, 'been submitted
to the sole arbitration of the United States
minister to Mexico.
The commission appointed under the
convention of February 18, 1889, to set new
monuments along the boundary between
the United States and Mexico has comÂ­
pleted its task.
As a sequence of the failure of a scheme
1 for the colonization in Mexico of negroes,
> mostly emigrants, from Alabama under
contract, a great number of these helpÂ­
less and suffering people, starving and
smitten with contagious disease, made
1 their way or were assisted to the frontier,
where in a wretched plight, they were
1 quarantined by the Texas authorities.
Learning of their destitute condition, I
directed rations to be furnished them
through the war department. With the
expiration of the quarantine, they were
conveyed by the railway company at comÂ­
paratively nominal rates to their homes
in Alabama upon my assurance in the abÂ­
sence of any fund available for the cost
of their transportation, that I would
a recommend to congress an appropriation
for its payment. I now strongly urge
upon congress the propriety of making
such an appropriation. It should be reÂ­
n -nbered that the measures taken were
dictated, not only by sympathy and huÂ­
manity, but by a conviction that it was
not compatible with the dignity of this
government that so large a body of our
dependent citizens should be thrown for
relief upon the charity of a neighboring
state.

THE TROUBIE' OF NICARAGUA
Great Britain's Bluff and the SubjugaÂ­
tion of the Republc.
In last year's message I narrated at
some length the jurisdictional questions
then freshly arisen in the M.iscuuito Indian
strip of Nicaragua,
Since that time. by the voluntary act
of the Mosquito nation, the territory reÂ­
served to them has been incorporated
with Nicaragua, the Indians formally subÂ­
jecting themselves to be governed by the
general laws and regulations of the repubÂ­
lic instead of by their own customs and
regulations and thus availing themselves
of a privilege secured to them by the
treaty between Nicaragua and Great
Britain of January 28, 1865.
After this extension of uniform NicaraÂ­
guan administration to the Mosquito strip
the case of the British vice consul. Hatch,
and of several of his countrymen who had
been summarily expelled from Nicaragua
and treated with considerable indignity,
provoked a claim by Great Britain upon
Nicaragua for pecuniary indemnity, which
upon Nicaragua's refusal to admit liaÂ­
bility was enforced by Great Britain.
While the sovereignty and jurisdiction of
Nicaragua was in no way questioned by
Great Britain, the former's arbitrary conÂ­
duct in regard to British subjects furnishÂ­
ed the ground for this proceeding.
A British naval force occupied without
resistance the Pacific seaport of Corinto,
but was soon afterward withdrawn upon
the promise that the sum demanded would
be paid. Throughout this incident the
kindly offices of the United States were
invoked and were employed in favor of
a peaceful settlement and with as much
consideration and indulgence toward
Nicaragua as were consistent with the
nature of the case. These efforts have
since been made the subject of appropriate
and grateful recognition by Nicaragua.
RUSSIAN MATTERS.
The coronation of the czar of Russia at
Moscow in May next invites the cereÂ­
monial participation of the United States
and in accordance with usage and diploÂ­
matic propriety, our minister to the imÂ­
perial court has been directed to repÂ­
resent our government on this occasion.
Correspondence is on foot touching the
practice of Russian consuls within the
jurisdiction of the United States to interÂ­
rogate citizens as to their race and reÂ­
ligious faith and upon ascertainment
thereof to deny to Jews authentication
of passports or legal documents for use
in Russia may be found to infringe the
treaty rights of our citizens and which is
an obnoxious invasion of our territorial
jurisdiction, it has elicited a fitting remonÂ­
strance, the result of which it is hoped
will remove the cause of complaint.
The pending claim of sealing vessels
of the United States seized in Russian
waters remain unadjusted. Our recent
convention with Russia establishing a
modus vivendi as to imperial jurisdiction
in such cases has prevented further difÂ­
ficulty of this nature. The Russian govÂ­
ernment has welcomed in principle our
suggestion for a modus vivendi to embrace
Great Britain and Japan looking to the
better preservdtion of seal life in the
North Pacific and Bering seas and the
extension of the protected area defined by
the Paris tribunal to all Pacific waters
north of the 35th parallel.
It is especially noticeable that RusÂ­
sia favors prohibition of the use of the
firearms in seal hunting throughout the
proposed area and a longer closed seaÂ­
son for pelagic sealing.
AS TO SAMOA.
In my last two annual messages I called
the attention of the congress to the posiÂ­
tion we occupy as one of the parties to a
treaty or agreement by which we became
jointly bound with England and Germany
to so interfere with the government and
control Samoa as in effect to assume the
management of its affairs. On the 9th of
May, 1894, I transmitted to the senate a
special message with accompanying docuÂ­
ments giving information on the subject
and emphasizing the opinion I have at all
time entertained that our situation in this
matter was inconsistent with the mission
and traditions of our government, in vioÂ­
lation of the principles we profess and
in all its phases, mischievous and vexaÂ­
tious. I again press this subject upon the
attention of congress and ask for such
legislative action or expression as will
lead the way to our relief from obligaÂ­
tions both irksome and unnatural.
AN INSURRECTION ON CUBAN SOIL
Neutrality l.aws Must Be Observed, No
Matter What Grievance There Is.
Cuba is again gravely disturbed. An
insurrection, in one respect, more active
than the last preceding revolt which conÂ­
tinued from 1868 to 1878 now exists in a
large part of the eastern interior of the
island, menacing even some of the popuÂ­
lation on the coast. Besides deranging
the commercial exchanges of the island,
of which our country takes the predomiÂ­
nant share, this flagrant condition of hosÂ­
tilities, by arousing sentimental sympathy
and Inciting adventurous support among
our people, has entailed earnest effort on
the part of this government to enforce
obedience to our neutrality laws and to
prevent the territory of the United
States from being abused as a vantage
ground from which to aid those bearing
arms against Spanish sovereignty.
Whatever may be ~the traditional symÂ­
pathy of our countrymen as individuals
with a people who seem to be struggling
for larger autonomy and greater freedom,
and depend, as such sympathy naturally
must, on behalf of our neighbors, yet the
plain duty of their government is to obÂ­
sen-rve in good faith the recognized obliÂ­
gations of international relationship. The
performance of this duty should not be
made more difficult by a disregard on the
Spart of our citizens of the obligations
growing out of their allegiance to their
I country, which should restrain them from
violating as individuals the neutrality
which the nation of which they are memÂ­
bers is bound to observe in its relations
to friendly sovereign states. Though
neither the wa""rmth of our people's sym

pathy with the Cuban Insurgents, nor the
loss nor material damage consequent upon
the futile endeavors thus far made
to restore peace and order, or any shock
our humane sensibility may have received
from the cruelties which appear to especiÂ­
ally characterize this sanguinary and
fiercely conducted war, have in the least
shaken the determination of the governÂ­
ment to honestly fulfill every international
obligation, yet it is to be earnestly hoped
on every ground that the devastation of
armed conflict may speedily be stayed
and order and quiet restored to the disÂ­
tracted island, bringing into their train
the activity and thrift of peaceful purÂ­
suits.
ALLIANCA INCIDENT.
One notable instance of interference
by Spain with passing American ships has
occurred. On March 8, last, the Allianca,
while bound from Colon to New York, and
following the customary track for vessels
near the Cuban shore, but outside the
three-mile limit, was fired upon by a SpanÂ­
ish gunboat. Protest was promptly made
by the United States against this act as
not being justified by a state of war, nor
permissable in respect to vessels on the
usual paths of commerce, nor tolerable in
view of the wanton peril occasioned to
innocent life and property. The act was
disavowed, with full expression of reÂ­
gret, and assurance of non-recurrence of
such just cause of complaint, while the
offending officer was relieved of his comÂ­
mand.
Military arrests of citizens of the United
States in Cuba have occasioned frequent
reclamations. 1Where held on criminal
charges their delivery to the ordinary
civil jurisdiction for trial has been deÂ­
manded and obtained in conformity with
treaty provisions and where merely deÂ­
tained by way of military precaution unÂ­
der a proclaimed state of seige without
formulated accusation their release or
trial has been insisted upon. The right of
American consular officers on the island
to prefer protests and demands in such
cases having been questioned by the inÂ­
sular authorities, their enjoyment of the
privilege stipulated by treaty for the conÂ­
suls of Germany was claimed under the
most favored nation provision of our own
convention and was promptly recognized.
MORA CLAIM.
The long standing demand of Antonio
Maximo Mora against Spain has at last
been settled by the payment, on the 14th
of September last, of the sum originally
agreed upon in liquidation of the claim.
Its distribution among the parties entitled
to receive it has proceeded as rapidly as
the rights of those claiming the fund
could be safely determined.
The enforcement of differential duties
against products of this counlltry exported
to Cuba and Puerto Itico prompted the
immediate claim on our part to the beneÂ­
fit of the minimum tariff of Spain in reÂ­
turn for the most favorable treatment
permitted by our laws as regards to proÂ­
duction of Spanish territories. A comÂ­
mercial arrangement was concluded in
January last securing the treatment so
claimed.
Vigorous protests against excessive
fines imposed on our merchandise by the
customs officers of these islands for triÂ­
vial errors have resulted in the remission
of such fines in instances where the equity
of the complaint was apparent, though the
vexatious practice has not been wholly
discontinued.
OUR MISSIONARIES IN TUIIKEY

American Consuls Have Done Their UtÂ­
most to Protect Them.
Advices from Turkey have continued to
excite the people concerning the reported
massacres of Christians in Armenia and
the development there and in other disÂ­
tricts of a spirit of fanatical hostility to
Christian influences naturally excited ap
prehension for the safety of the devoted
men and women who, as dependents of
the foreign missionary societies in the
United States, reside In Turkey under the
guarantee of law and usage and in the
legitimate performance of their educaÂ­
tional and religious mission. No efforts
have been spared in their behalf and their
protection in person and property has
been earnestly and vigorously enforced by
every means within our power. I regret,
however, that an attempt on our part to
obtain better information concerning the
true condition of affairs in the disturbed
quarters of the Ottoman empire by sendÂ­
ing thither the United States consul at
Sivas to make investigation and the report
was thwarted by the objections of the
Turkish government. This government
on our part was in no sense meant as a
gratuitous entanglement of the United
States in the so-called eastern question,
nor as an officious interference with the
right and duty which belong by treaty to
certain great European powers, which
called for their intervention in political
matters affecting the good government
and religious freedom of the non-MusselÂ­
man subjects of the sultan, but it arose
solely from our desire to have an accurate
knowledge of the conditions in our efforts
to care for those entitled to our protection.
The presence of our naval vessels, which
are now in the vicinity of the disturbed
territories, affords opportunity to acquire
a measure of familiarity with the condiÂ­
tion of affairs, and will enable us to take
suitable steps for the protection of any inÂ­
terests of our countrymen within reach of
our ships that might be found imperilled.
The Ottoman government has lately isÂ­
sued an imperial tirade exempting forever
from taxation any American college for
girls at Scutari. Repeated assurances
have also been obtained by our envoy at
Constantinople that similar institutions
maintained and administered by our counÂ­
trymen shall be secured in the enjoyment
,f all rights and that our citizens throughÂ­
out the empire shall be protected.
The government, however, in view of
cxisting facts, is far from relying upon
such assurances as the limit of its duty.
)ur minister has been vigilant and alert
in affording all possible protection in inÂ­
dividual cases where danger threatened
or safety was imperilled. We have sent
ships as far toward the points of actual
disturbance as it is possible for them to
go, where they offer refuge to those obligÂ­
,d to flee and we have the promise of
-ther powers which have ships in the
neighborhood that our citizens, as well as
their citizens, will be received and protectÂ­
od on board those ships.
On the demand of our ministers orders
,ave been issued by the sultan that TurkÂ­
sh soldiers shall guard and escort to the
roist American refugees. Those orders
h,ave been carried out, and our latest inÂ­
elligence gives assurance of the present
rersonal safety of our citizens and misÂ­
ionaries. Though thus far no lives of
American citizens have been sacrificed,
there can be no doubt that serious loss
and destruction of mission property have
resulted from riotous conflicts and outÂ­
rageous attacks.
By treaty several of the most powerful
European powers have secured a right
and have assumed a duty not only in beÂ­
half of their own citizens and in furthÂ­
crance of their own interests, but as
agents of the Christian world. Their right
.s to enforce such conduct of the Turkish
government as will restrain fanatical
brutality and if this fails their duty is to
so interfere as to insure against such
dreadful occurences in Turkey as have
lately shocked civilization. The powers
declare this right and this duty to be
theirs alone, and it is earnestly hoped
that prompt and effective action on their
part will not be delayed.
The consulates at Erzeroum and agents
at Erzeroum and Karpout, for which apÂ­
propriation was made last session, have
been previously filed by trusted employes
of the department of state. These apÂ­
pointees, though now in Turkey, have not
received their exequators.
ARBITRATED CASES.
The arbitration of the claim of the VeneÂ­
zuela steam transportation company unÂ­
ier the treaty of January 19, 1892, between
the United States and Venezuela resulted
in an award in favor of the claimant.
The government has used its good ofÂ­
ices toward composing the differences beÂ­
tween Venezuela on the one hand and
France and Belgium on the other, growing
out of the dismissal of the representaÂ­
tives of these powers on the ground of
a publication deemed offensive to VeneÂ­
zuela. Although that dismissal was
coupled with a cordial request that other
more personally agreeable envoys be sent

Sin their stead, a rupture of intercourn
ensued and still continues.
I'll'ROVE THE CONSULAR SE1VIC
The President Advises That Civil Servln
Regu:ations Apply.
In view of the growth of our interes'
in foreign countries and the encouragin
prospects for general expansion of ot
commerce, the question of an improv,
mnent in the consular service has increase
in importance and urgency. Though thet
is no doubt that the great body of consula
officers are rendering valuable service
to the trade and industries of the cour
try, the needs of some plan of appoin:
ment and control which would tend t
secure a higher average of efficiency ca
not be denied. The importance of th
subject has led the executive to conside
what steps might properly be taken witt
out additional legislation and answer th
need of a better system of consular al
pointments.
The matter having been committed t
the consideration of the secretary of stat
in pursuance of his recommendations a
executive order was issued on the 20th c
September, 1895, by the terms of which i
is provided that after that date any va
cancy in a consulate or commercia

THE SECRET OF A GOOD DISPOSITION.
Mrs. Pinkham Says a Careful Regard for Bodily Health Makes Women
Sweet and Attractive to Ail.
The world is filled with sweet women who are held back from usefulness by
some trouble of the female organs.
Fretfulness and nervousness rapidly destroy sweet dispositions.
Sickly all-worn-out women cannot live happy
lives. Nearly every woman may be well and
happy if she will follow Mrs. Pinkham's advice.
See what Mrs. Craig says:
""Dear Mrs. Pinkham:â€” I have taken Lydia E.
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound and
think it is the best medicine for women
in the world. I was so weak and nervÂ­
ous that I thought I could not live from
one day to the next. I had prolapsus
uteri and leucorrhcea, and thought that
I would die. I had dragging
pains in my back, burning senÂ­
y I sation down to my feet, and so
V-l, many miserable feelings. PeoÂ­
ple said that I looked like a dead
woman. Doctors tried to cure
me, but failed. I had given up
when I heard of the Pinkham
medicine. I got a bottle. I did
not have much faith in it, but
thought I would try it, and it
made a new woman of me. I
wish I could get every lady in
the land to try it, for it did for
me what doctors could not do.""
â€”Mrs. Sallie Craig, Raker's Landing, Pa.
That Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound is a
safeguard of woman's health is clearly proven by the
thousands of letters constantly being received. Here
is one from Mrs. W. P. Valentine, 566 Ferry Aveâ€ž Camden, N. J.:
"" Dear Mrs. Pinkham: â€”Before writing to you I felt very bad, had terrible
sick headaches, no appetite, gnawing pain in stomach, pain in my back and right
side; was tired and nervous, and so weak I could scarcely stand. I was not
able to do anything, had sharp pains all through my body. Before I had taken
half a bottle of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound, I found myself imÂ­
proving. I continued its use until I had taken four bottles, and felt so well
that I did not need to take any more. I am like a new person.*

The depth of the water is unknown,
and its surface is smooth and unruffled,

THE MESSAGE.
To tie Senate and House of Representatives:





Since the convening of Congress one year
ago the nation has undergone a prostration in
business and industries such as has not been
witnessed with us for many years. SpeculaÂ­
tion as to the causes for this prostration might
be indulged in without profit, because as many
theories would be advanced as there would be
independent writers-those who expressed
their own views without borrowing-upon the
subject. Without indulging in theories as to
the cause of this prostration, therefore I will
call your attention only to the fact, and to
some questions as to which it would seem there
should he no disagreement. During this prosÂ­
tration two essential elements of prosperity
have been most abundant-labor and capital.
Both have been largely unemployed. Where
security has been undoubted, capital has been
attainable at very moderate rates. Where labor
has been wanted, it has been found in abundÂ­
ance at cheap rates, comparing what the necesÂ­
saries and comforts of life could be purchased
with the wages demanded. Two great eleÂ­
ments of prosperity, therefore, have not been
denied us. A third might be. added. Our soil
and climate are unequaled, within the limits of
any contiguous territory under one nationality,
for its varieties of produce to feed and clothe a
people, and an amount of surplus to spare to
feed less favored people. Therefore, with these
facts in view, it seems time that wise statesmanÂ­
ship at this session of Congress would dictate
ignoring the past, distributing in the proper
channels these great elements of prosperity to
any people. Debt abroad is the only element
that can, with always a sound currency. enter
into our affairs to cause any continued depresÂ­
sion in the industries and prosperity of our peoÂ­
pile. A general conflict for national existence
k
made necessary, for temporary purposes, the
raising of large sums of money from whatÂ­
ever source attainable. It made necessary, in
the wisdom of Congress, and I do not doubt
their wisdom in the premises, regarding
the necessity of the times, to devise a system of
national currency which proved to be impossiÂ­
ble to keep on a par with the recognized curÂ­
rency of the civilized world. This begot a
spirit of speculation, involving an extravagance
and luxury not required for the happiness or
prosperity of a people, and involving, both diÂ­
rectly and indirectly, foreign indebtedness.
The currency, being of too fluctuating value to
be safe to hold for legitimate transactions reÂ­
quiring money, became a subject of speculation
in itself. These two causes, however, have inÂ­
volved us in a foreign indebtedness, contracted
in good faith by borrower and lender, which
should be paid in coin and according to the
bond agreed upon when the debt was contracted
-gold, or its equivalent. The good faith of
the government cannot be violated towards
creditors at the expense of national disgrace.
Our commerce should be encouraged, AmeriÂ­
can ship-builking and carrying capacity inÂ­
creased, foreign markets sought for the proÂ­
ducts of the soil and manufactories, to the end
that we may be able to pay these debts. Where
a market can be created for the sale of our proÂ­
ducts, either of the soil, the mine or the manÂ­
ufactory. a new means is discovered of utilizing
our idle capital and labor to the advantage of
the whole country.
SPECIE R ESUMITION.
But, in my judgment, the first step towards
aocomplishing this object is to secure a curÂ­
rency good wherever civilization reigns, on
which, if it becomes superabundant with one
people, will find a market with some other; a
currency which has for its basis the labor necÂ­
essary to produce it which will give it value.
Gold and silver are now the recognized mpediÂ­
ums of exchange the civilized world over, and
to this we should return with the least practicÂ­
able delay. In view of the pledges of the
American Congress when our present legal-tenÂ­
der system was adopted and debts contracted,
there should he no delay, certainly no unnecÂ­
essary delay, in fixing by legislation a method
by w.:ichl it will return to specie. To the acÂ­
complishment of this end I invite your attenÂ­
tion. I believe firmly there can be no prosÂ­
perous and permanent revival of business and
industries until a policy is adopted, with legisÂ­
lation to carry it out, looking to a return to
specie basis. It is easy to conceive that the
debtor and speculative classes may think it of
value to make a so-called money abundant unÂ­
til they can throw a portion of their burdens
upon others. But even these, I. believe, would
be disappointed in the result if
, course should
........ .. ^.... -,1 c,.... ; n Â·lt thA value i


uC jJursueu wnillll will A""r' y
of the legal-tender medium of exchange. A
revival of productive industries is needed by
all classes-by none more than the holders of
property of whatever sort with debts to liquiÂ­
date from realization upon its sales. But, adÂ­
mitting that the two classes of citizens are to be
benefited by expansion, would it be honest to
give it? Would not the general loss be too
great. to justify such relief? Would it not be
just as honest and prudent to authorize each
debtor to issue hiÂ­ own legal tenders to the exÂ­
tent of his liabilities as to do this ? Would
it not be safer, for fear of over-issue by unscruÂ­
pulous creditors, to say that all debt obligaÂ­
tions are obliterated in the United States,
and now we commence anew, and each possessÂ­




 ing all he has at the time free from incumÂ­
brance ?
These propositions are too absurd to be enterÂ­
tained for a moment by thinking people. Every
delay in the preparation of final resumption
f
partakes of this dishonesty, and is only less in
degree as the hope is held out that a convenient
season will at last arrive for the good work of
redeeming our pledges to commerce. It will
never come, in my opinion, except by positive
action by Congress, 'or by national disaster,
which will destroy for a time, at least, the credit
of individuals and the state at large. A sound
currency must be reached or the total bankÂ­
ruptcv of the credit and integrity of the nation
and o'f individuals may ensue. I believe it is in
the power of Congress at this session to devise
such legislation as will renew confidence, revive
all industries, start us on a career of prosperity,
to last for many years, and save the credit of
the nation, and the proper steps toward a reÂ­
turn to a specie basis are the great requisites to
this devoutly to be sought for end. There are
others which I may touch upon hereafter. A
nation dealing in a currency below that of
specie in value, labors under two great disadÂ­
vantarres.
1. Rfaving
no use for the world's acknowlÂ­
edged medium of exchange, gold and silver,
i these are driven out of the country because
there is no demand for their use.
2. The medium of exchange in use being of
a fluctuating value-for after all it is only worth
just what it will purchase of gold and silver
metals, having an intrinsic value just in proporÂ­
tion to the honest labor it takes to produce
them-a large margin must be allowed for
profit by the manufacturer and producer. It is
months from the date of production to the date
of realization. Interest upon capital must be
charged, and risk of fluctuation in the value of
that which is to be received in payment.added.
p
Hence, high prices, acting as a protection to
the foreign producer, who receives nothing in
exchange for the product of his skill and labor
except a currency good at a staple value the
world over. It seems to me that nothing is
clearer than that the greater part of the burden
of existing prostration, for the want of a sound
r financial system, falls upon the workingman
2 who must after all produce the wealth, and the
salaried man who superintends and conducts
business. The burden falls upon them in two
ways-by the deprivation of employment and
t by the increased purchasing power of their salÂ­
t aries.
e
It is the duty of Congress to devise the
I method of correcting the evils which are acÂ­
knowledged to exist, and not mine; but I will
venture to suggest two or three things which
seem to me as absolutely necessary to return to
specie payments: As the first great requisite
3
to a return to prosperity, the legal-tender clause
a to the law authorizing the issue of currency by
the national government, should be repealed,
to take effect as to all contracts after day fixed
in the repealing act, not to apply, however, to
payments of salaries by the government, or for
other expenses now provided by law to be paid
"" in currency. In the interval pending between
repeal and final resumption, provision should
be made by which the Secretary of the TreasuÂ­
Sry can obtain gold, as it may become necessary
from time to time, from the date when specie
resumption commences. To this might, and
should be added a revenue sufficiently in excess
Â°
of expenses to insure an accumulation of gold
1 in the treasury to sustain redemption.
f I commend this subject to your careful conÂ­
sideration, believing that a favorable solution is
a attainable, and that, if reached by this Congress,
that the present and future generations will ever
gratefully remember it as the delivery from the
e thraldom of evil and disgrace.
FREE BA.NKING.
e
With resumption free banking may be inauÂ­
r gurated with safety, giving the full protection to
D billholders which they have under existing laws.
t
Indeed, I would regard free banking as esÂ­
sential. It would give proper elasticity to the
currency. As more currency should be required
Sfor the transaction of legitimate business new
- banks would be started, and in turn banks
would wind up their business when it was found
that there was a superabundance of currency.
_ The experience and judgment of the people can
best decide just how much currency is required
for the transaction of the business of the counÂ­
t try. It is unsafe to leave the settlement of this
question to Congress, the Secretary of the TreasÂ­
f nary or the Executive. Congress should make
- the regulation under which banks may exist,
hut should not make banking a monopoly by
limiting the amount of redeemable paper curÂ­
rency that shall be unchanged. Such importÂ­
ance do I attach to this subject, and so earnestly
Sdo
I commend it to your attention, that I give
it prominence by introducing it at the beginning
of this message.
OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS.
During the past year nothing has occurred to
disturb the general friendly and cordial relaÂ­
tions of the United States with other powers.


i ie correspontence suumlttea nerewltn, DeÂ­
tween the government and its diplomatic repreÂ­
sentatives in other countries, shows a satisfacÂ­
tory condition of all questions between the
United States and the representatives of those
countries, and, with a few exceptions, to which
reference is hereafter made, the absence of any
points of difference to be adjusted.
THE TREATY WITH BELGIUM.
The notice directed by the resolution of ConÂ­
gress of June 17, 1874, to be given to terminate
the convention of July 17, 1858, between the
United States and Belgium, has been given, and
the treaty will accordingly terminate on the 1st
day of July, 1875. This convention was seÂ­
cured to retain for Belgian vessels entering the
ports of the United States exceptional privileges
which are not accorded to our own vessels.
Other features of the convention have proved
satisfactory, and have tended to a cultivation of
mutually beneficial commercial intercourse and
friendly relations between the two countries. I
hope that the negotiations which have been inÂ­
stituted will result in the celebration of another
treaty, which may tend to the interest of both
countries.
CHINA AND JAPAN.
Our relations with China continue friendly.
During the past year the fear of hostilities beÂ­
tween China and Japan, growing out of the
landing of an armed force upon the island of
Formosa by the latter, has occasioned uneasiÂ­
ness. It is earnestly hoped, however, that the
difficulties arising from this cause will be adÂ­
justed, and that the advance of civilization in
those empires may not be retarded by a state of
war. In consequence of the part taken by cerÂ­
tain citizens of the United States in this expeÂ­
dition our representatives in those countries
have been instructed to impress upon the govÂ­
ernments of China and Japan the firm intention
of the country to maintain strict neutrality in
the event of hostilities, and carefully prevent
any infraction of the laws on the part of our t
citizens.
CHINESE IMMIGRATION.
In connection with this subject I call the atÂ­
tention of Congress to a generally conceded
fact, that the great proportion of Chinese immiÂ­
grants who come to our shores do not come volÂ­
untarily to make their homes with us and their
labor productive of a general prosperity, but
come under contract with headmen who own
them almost absolutely. In a worse form does t
this apply to Chinese women. Hardly a perÂ­ i
ceptible percentage of them pertorm any honÂ­ a
orable labor. They are brought for shameful r
purposes, to the disgrace of the communities
where they are settled, and to the great deÂ­
moralization of the youth of those localities.
If this evil practice can be legislated against it
will be my pleasure, as well :as duty, to enforce
any regulation to secure so desirable an end.
NEGOTIATIONS WITH JAPAN.
It is hoped that negotiations between the

The Annual Message of
the President of the
United States,
[ Cnmtinued from First Page.J
OGovernment of Japan and the treaty powers,
looking to the further opening of the empire
and to the removal of certain restrictions upon
trade and travei, may soon produce results to
the benefit of all the parties. Having on preÂ­
vious occasions submitted to the consideration
of Congress the propriety of the release of the
Japanese Government from the farther payÂ­
mnent of indemnity under the convention of
Oct. 22,
, an84, nd, as no action had been taken
thereon, it became my duty to regard the obliÂ­
gations of the convention as in force, and, as
the other powers intrusted have received their
portion of the indemnity in full, the Minister
of the United States in Japan has, in behalf of
the government, received the:remainder of the
amount due to the United States under the conÂ­
stitution of Sisuseky. I submit the propriety
of applying the increase of a part, if not the
whole, of this tund to the education in the JapÂ­
anese langua""ge of a number of young men, to
be -nder obligations to serve the government
for a speeire time as interpreters at the legaÂ­
tion and the consulates in Japan. A limited
:number of .apanese youths might, at the same
time, be educated in our own vernacular, and
mutual benefit woued result to both governÂ­
ments. The imp',rtance of having our own
-citizens .cmpetent and familiar iith the lanÂ­
.guage of .japan, to act as interpreters and in
.other capacities correcoted with the legation and
-consulates in that .country, cannot readily be
,overestimated.
FOIZR'IGN CLAIMS.
The amount awarded to the government of
-Great Britain by the mixed commi sion organÂ­
ized under the prorisions of the Treity of WashÂ­
ington, in settlement of the claims of British
subjects, arising koro acts committed between
April.33, 1841, and April 9, 865, became pavaÂ­
ble, undler the terms of the treaty, within the
past year, and was paid upon the 21st day of
September, 1874. In this connection I renew
my reco'nmuendatin, made at the opening of the
last session of Congress, that a speciai court be
created to hear and determine all claims of
aliens gai's"".t the United States arising from
acts committed against their persons .and
propert; during the insurrection. It appears
eqnitable that opportunity should be offiered to
the citizens of other states to present their
claims, as well ac those of British subjects,
whose claims; were not admissable under the late
"" commission, to the early decision of some comÂ­
petent tribunal. To this end I recommend the
necessary legislation to organize a court to disÂ­
pose of these c.laims of aliens, of the nature reÂ­
ferred to, in an equitable and satisfactory manÂ­
ner, and to relieve Congress and the departments
from the consideration of these questions.
TIIE FISHERIES.
The le..isiation necessary to extend to the
.colony of Newfoundland certain .articles of the
Treaty of Washington of the 8th day of May,
1871, having been had., a protocol to that effect
was signed in behalf of the United States and
of Great i:ritian on the S2th day of May last,
-and was duly proclaimed on the foilowing day.
A copy of the proclamnation is submitted hereÂ­

THI BOUNDARY SURVEY.
The report of the Comnmission appointed unÂ­
-der the act of March 19, 1872, for surveying
and making the boundary between the United
States and the British possessions, from Lake
of the W\oods to the sunnmit of the Rocky
Mountains, is heret:itli transmitted. I am
happy to announce lhat the field work of the
4Commuission has been completed, and the enÂ­
tire line firom the northwest corner of the Lake
-of the WVoods to the summit of the Rocky
Mountains. has been run and marked upon the
surface of the earth. It is believed that the
amount remaining undisposed of the approÂ­
priation made at the last session of Congress
will be sufficient to complete the oflice work. I
recommend that the: authority of Congress be
given for the use of the unexpended balance of
tihe appropriation in the completion c "" the work
of the Commission in making the report and
printing a necessary map.
TIEr ALABAMA CLAIMS CO!MMISSION.
The court known as the Court of CommissionÂ­
ers of Alabama Clanms, created by an act of
Congress last session, has organizedl and comÂ­
menced its work, and it is to be hoped
that the claims advisa'ole under the orovisions
of the act may be speedily ascertained and
paid.


It has been deemed advisable to exercise the
discretion conferred upon the Executive at the
last sesion, by accepting the conditions reÂ­
quired by the Government of Turkey for the
privilege of allowing citizens of the United
States to hold real estate in the former country,
and by eflecting a certain change in the jurisÂ­
dictioil of the courts in the latter. A copy of
the proclamation upon these subjects is herewith
communicated.
INDEPIN:i.EN'T SPANISH STATES.
There has been no material change in our
relations with the independent states of this
hemisphere, which were formerly under the doÂ­
minion of Spain.
BORDER OUTRAGES.
Marauding on the frontier between Mexico
and Texas still frequently takes place, despite
the vigilance of the civil and military authoriÂ­
ties in that quarter. The difficulty of checking
such trespasses along the course of a river of
such length as the Rio Grande, which is often
fordable, is obvious. It is hoped that the efÂ­
forts of the government will be seconded by
those of Mexico to the effectual suppression of
act, of wrong.
THIE MEXICAN CLAIMS COMM0ISSION.
From a report upon the condition of the busiÂ­
ness before the American and Mexican Joint
Claims Commission, made by the agent on the
part of the United States, anlt dated Oct. 284
1874, it appears that of the 1017 claims filed.
on the part of the citizens of the United States,
483 had been finally decided and 75 were in
ihe hands of the umpire, leaving 462 to be disÂ­
posed of, and of the 993 claims filed against the
ttnited States. 726 had been finally decided on,
one was before the umpire and 271 remained
to be disposed of. Since the date of such
report, ot'er elaimsi have been disposed of,
reducing somewhat the number still
pending. and others have been passed upon by
the arbitrators. It has become apparent in
view of these igtures, and of the fact that the
work devolving on the umpire is particularly
laborious, that the commissioners would be
unable to dispose of the entire number of
claims neninug prior to the 1st day of FebruÂ­
ary. 1875, the date fixed for its expiration.
Ne`onia iincris are pending, looking to the securÂ­
ing otf results of decisions which have been
reached, and to a further extension of the comÂ­
mission for a limited time, whiich it is confiÂ­
dently hoped will suflice to brinrg all the busiÂ­
ness now before it to a final close.
THE IREVOLU'TION IN TIHE ARGENTINSREPUBÂ­
LIC.
The strife in the Argentine Republic is to be
deplored, both on account of the parties thereÂ­
to and from the probable effect on the interests
:of those engaged in the trade to that ouarter,
of whom the United States are among tile prinÂ­
cipal. As yet. so far as I am aware, there has
been. no violation of our neutrality rights,
which,,as well as our duties in that respect, it
slhall be my endeavor to maintain and observe.
THE VENEZUELA AWARDS.
It is ivith regret that I announce that no
further payment has been received from the
government of Venezuela on account of awards
in favor of citizens of the United States. Hopes
have been. entertained that if the republic
could escape both foreign and civil war for a
few years its great natural resources would enaÂ­
ble it to honor its obligations. Though it is
now understood to be at peace with other couaÂ­
tries, a serious insurrection is understood .to be

 in progriessin an inpor'ta t region 'of 'that reÂ­
public. This may be taken' advantage of as
another reason for the non-payment of the dues
'of our citizens.
,
THE BrVOLUTION IN, CUBA.
The deplorable strife hii Cuba contir;aes
without any marked change in the relativ
e adÂ­
vantages of the contending forces. The, insurÂ­
rection continues, but Spain has suff tred si
years of strife to give the Insurrectio'
ta siirgfiÂ­
cance which cannot be denied. Tts duration,
and the tenacity of its adherents; with an ab=
sence of manifested power of '`upp:ession on
the part of Spain, cannot be roitroverted, and
may induce some positive ste ss on the part of
other powers as a matter of self-necessity.
THE UNITED STATTF AND SPAIN.
I had confidently exp.eted at this time to be
able to announce the :xrrargement of some of
the important questions between this governÂ­
ment and that of Sapain, but the .egotiations
have been protract'ed. The unhappy intes
tine disturbance of Snain commands our proÂ­
found sympathy, andil must be accepted as
perhaps a cause of some delay. A. treaty setÂ­
tlement, in part, at least, of questions between
these governments is hoped. In the meantime,
awaiting the results of immediately pending neÂ­
gotiations, I defer further and fuller communiÂ­
cation on the subject of the relations of' this
country and Spain.
THE EXTRADITION LAWS.
I have again to call the attention of Congress
te the unsatisfactory condition of the existing
laws with reference to extradition, and the elecÂ­
fion of nationality. Formerly, amid conflicting
opinions and decisions, it was difficult to
exactly determine how far the doctrine
of perpetual allegiance was applicable
to the citizens of the United States. Congress,
by the act of the 20th of July, 1888, asserted
the abstract right of expatriation as a fundaÂ­
mental principle of this government. NotwithÂ­
standing such assertion, and the necessity of fceÂ­
quent application of the principle, legislation
has been had defining what acts or formalities
should work expatriation, or when a citizen
should be deemed to have been recognized to
his citizenship. The importance of such definiÂ­
tion is obvious. The representatives of the
United States in foreign countries are continÂ­
ually called upon to lend their aid and the proÂ­
tection of the United States to persons concernÂ­
ing the good faith, or reality of whose citizenÂ­
ship, there is at least great question. In
some cases the provisions of the treaty furnish
some guide. In others it seems left to the
persons claiming the benefit of citizen
ship while living in a foreign
country, contributing in no manner
by the performance of the duties of citizens of
the United States, and without intention at any
time to return and undertake these duties--who
claim citizenship of the United States simply as
a shield from the performance of the obligaÂ­
tions of citizens elsewhere. The cases of chilÂ­
dren born of American parents residing in a
foreign country, of American women who have
married aliens, of American citizens residing
abroad, where such questions are not regulated
by treaty, are subjected to frequent difficulty.
Legislation upon this and similar questions, and
particularly defining when and under what cirÂ­
cumstances expatriation can be accomplished or
be presumed, is especially necessary.
FRAUDULENT NATURALIZATION.
In this connection I earnestly call the attenÂ­
tion of Congress to the difficilty arising from
fraudulent naturalization. The United States
wisely, freely and liberally offers its citizenship
to all who may come in good faith and reside
within its limits, on their complying with cerÂ­
tain orescribed reasonable formulas and condiÂ­
tions. Among the highest duties of. the
government is that to affbrd firm, efficient
and effectual protection to all citizens, whether
native-born or naturalized. Steps should be
taken that that right, carrying with it such
support from the government, should not be
fraudulently obtained, and should be beÂ­
stowed only' upon full proof of compliance
with the law. There are frequent
instances of illegal and fraudulent naturalizaÂ­
tion and of the unauthorized certificates thus
improperly obtained. In some cases the
fraudulent character of the naturalization has
appeared upon the face of the certificate itself;
in other examinations discloses that the holder
had not complied with the law; and in others
certificates have been obtained where the
persons holding them not only were not enÂ­
titled to be naturalized, but had not even been
within the United States at the time of their
pretended naturalization. Instances of each of
these classes of fraud are discovered at our leÂ­
gations, where the certificates of naturalization
are presented either for the purpose of obtainÂ­
ing passports, or in demanding the protection
of the legation. When fraud was on the face
of such certificates they were taken up by the
representatives of the government
and forwarded to the Department
of State. But even the record of
the court in wlhich fraudulent naturalization


occurred remains, and duplicate certificates are
readily obtainable upon the presentation of these,
for the issue of passports or demanding protecÂ­
tion of the government. The fraud, sometimes
escapes notice, and such certificates are not unÂ­
frequenily used in the transaction of business,
to the deception and injury of innocent parties.
Without placing any additional obstacle in the
way of the obtainment of citizenship by the
worthy and well intentioned foreigner who
comes to cast his lot in good faith with ours, I
earnestly recommend further legislation to punÂ­
ish fraudulent naturalization and to secure the
ready cancelation of the record of every natÂ­
uralization made in fraud.
TREATIES.
Since my last annual message the exchange
has been made of the ratification of treaties of
extradition with Belgium, Equador, Peru and
Salvador; also of a treaty of commerce and
navigatian with Peru, and one of commerce
and consular privileges with .Salvador, all of
which have been duly proclaimed, as has also
a declaration with Prussia with regard to trade
marks.
THE FINANCES.
The report of the Secretary of the Treasury.
which, by law, is made directly to Congress,
and forms no part of this message, will show
the receipts and expenditures of the governÂ­
ment for the last fiscal year; the amount reÂ­
ceived from each source of revenue, and the
amount paid out for each of the departments of
the government. It will be observed from this
report that the amount of receipts over expenÂ­
ditures has been but $2,344,8S2.30 for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1874; and that for the curÂ­
rent fiscal year the estimated receipts over exÂ­
penditures will not much exceed $9,000,000.
Ip view of the large national debt existing, and
the obligations to add 1 per cent. per annum
to the sinking fund, a sum amounting now to.
over $34,000,000 per annum, I submit whether
the revenues should not be increased, or the exÂ­
penditures diminished, to reach this amount of
surplus. Not to provide for the sinking fund or
a partial failure to comply with the contracts
and obligations of the government would be
most disastrous to our credit. At the last sesÂ­
sion of Congress a very considerable reduction
was made in rates of taxation and the number
of articles submitted to taxation, the question
may well be asked, whether or not, in some inÂ­
stances, unwisely. in connection with this subÂ­
ject, too, 1 venture the opinion that the means
of collecting the revenue, and especially for imÂ­
ports, have been so embarrassed by legislation
as to make it questionable whether or not large
amounts are not lost by failure to collect, to the
direct loss of the treasury and the prejudice of
the interests of the honest importers and taxÂ­
payers.
The Secretary of the Treasury, in his report,
favors legislation looking to specie payments.
thus supporting the views previously expressed
in this message. He also recommendseconomy
in appropriations; directs attention to the loss of
revenue from repealing the tax on tea and coffee:
without benefit to the consumer; recommends
an increase of ten cents a gallon on whisky;,
and further that no modification be made in the
.banking and currency bill passed at the last
session of Congress, unless modification should
become necessary by reason of the adoption of
measures for returninm to specie payments. In
those measures I cordially join.
I-would suggest to Congress the propriety of.

 adi 4Wnt the tariffso as to increasethe revenue.
a'laat the same time decrease the number, of
artieses upon which duties are levied.
Those articles which eniter into our manufacÂ­
tures and are not produced at home, it seems
to me. should be admitted free. Those a""ticles
of manufacture which we produce a constituÂ­
ent part of, but do not produce the whole-that
part which we do not produce should enter free
ialso. I will instance fine wool, dyes etc.
These articles must be imported to form a part
of the manufacturing of the higher--gradesof
woollen goods. Chemicals, used as dyes, comÂ­
pounded in medicines, and used in various ways
in manufacturing, come under this class. The
introduction, free of duties. of such wools as we
do not produce would stimulate the manufacÂ­
ture of goods requiring the use of those we do
produce, and therefore would be a benefit to
home production. There are many articles
entering into home manufacture which we do
not produce ourselves, the tariff upon which
increases the cost of producing the manufacÂ­
tured article. All corrections in this regard are
in the direction of bringing labor and capital in
harmony with each other, and of supplying one
of the elements of prosperity so much needed.
THE WAR DEPARTMENT.
The report of the Secretary of War, hereÂ­
with attached, and forming part of this mesÂ­
sage, gives all the information concerning the
operations, wants and necessities of the army,
and contains many suggestions and recomÂ­
mendations which I commend to your special
attentions. There is no class of government
employes who are harder worked than the army
officers, and none who perform their tasks more
cheerfully and efficiently, and under circumÂ­
stances of greater privations and hardships.
Legislation is desirable to render more efficient
this branch of the public service. All the
recommendations of the Secretary of War I reÂ­
gard as judicious, and I especially commend
the following: The consolidation of the govÂ­
ernraent arsenals; the restoration of mileages
to officials traveling under orders; the exempÂ­
tion of money received from the sale of subsistÂ­
enea stores from being covered into the treasÂ­
.ary; the use of appropriations for the purchase
of subsistence stores without waiting for the be.
ginning of the fiscal year for which the
appropiiation .is made; for additional apÂ­
propriations for the collection of torpedo maÂ­
terials; for increased appropriations for the
manufacture of arms; :for relieving the various
states from indebtedness, for arms charged to
them during the rebellion; for dropping officers
from the rolls of the army without trial, for the
offense of drawing pay more than once for the
same period; for the discouragement of the plan
to pay the soldiers by checks, and for the estabÂ­
lisument of a professorship of RIhetoric and
English Literature at West Point. The reasons
-for the recommendations are obvious, and are
. et forth sufficiently in the report attached. I
.also recommend that the status of the staff corps
i
of the army be fixed, which has not already
been done, so that promotions may be made;
vacancies filled, as they occur in each grade
when reduced below the number fixed by law.
The necessity for such legislation is specially
felt now in the pay department. The number
of vacancies in that department is below the
number adequate to the performance of duties
required of them by law.
THE NAVY.
The efficiency of the navy has been largely
increased during last year under the impulse of
foreign complications which threatened us at
the commencement of last session of Congress.
Most of our efficient wooden ships were put in
condition for immediate service, and the repairs
of our ironclad fleet were pushed with the
utmost vigor. The result is that most of these
are effective, and need only to be manned and
set in commission to go at once into service.
Some of the new sloops authorized by
Congress are already in commisÂ­
sion, and most of the remainder are
launched, and wait only the completion of their
machinery to enable them to take their places
as nart of our effective force. Two iron torÂ­
pedo shins have been completed during the last
year, and four of our large double-turreted
ironclads are now undergoing repairs. When
these are finished, everything that is needful of
our navy, as at present authorized,, will be in
condition for service, and, with the advance in
the science of torpedo warfare, the American
navy, comparatively small as it is. will be found
at any time powerful enough for the purposes of
a peaceful nation.
SURVES AND OBSERVATIONS.
Much has also been accomplished during the
year in aid of science, and to increase the sum
of general knowledge and further the interests
of commerce and civilization, extensive and
much-needed soundings have been made for
hydrographic purposes, and to fix the proper
routes of ocean telegraphs. Further surveys
of the great isthmus have been undertaken
and completed, and two vessels of the navy
are now employed in conjunction with those


ot tngianct, Jirance, (kermany and .t ussia in
observations connected with the transit of
Venus, useful and interesting to the scienÂ­
tific world. The estimates for this branch of
public service do not differ materially from those
of last year, the general support of the service
being somewhat less, and thus far improvements
at the various stations rather larger than the
corresponding estimate made a year ago. The
regular maintenance and a steady increase in
the efficiency of this most important arm, in proÂ­
portion to the growth of our maritime interÂ­
course and interests, is recommended to the atÂ­
tention of Congress. The use of the navy durÂ­
ing peace might be further utilized by a direct
authorization of the employment of naval vesÂ­
sels in surveys of the supposed navigable waters
of other nationalities on this continent, espeÂ­
ciaily the tributaries of the two great rivers of
South America, the Orinoco and the Amazon.
Nothing prevents, under existing laws, such
explorations, except that expenditures must be
made for such expeditions beyond those usually
provided for by the appropriations. The field
designated is unquestionably one of interest,
and one capable of large development of comÂ­
mercial interests, advantageous to the people
reached, and to those who may estalish relaÂ­
tions with them.
THE POSTOFFICE DEPARTITMET.
The education of the people entitled to exÂ­
ercise the right of franchise I regard as essenÂ­
tial to the general prosperity everywhere, and
especially so in republics where both education
and previous condition do not enter into acÂ­
count in giving suffrage. Next to the public
school, the postoffice is the great agent of eduÂ­
cation over our vast territory. The rapidity with
which new sections are being settled, thus inÂ­
creasing the carrying of the mails in a more
rapid ratio than the increase of receipts, is not
alarming. The report of the Postmaster GenÂ­
eral, herewith attached, shows that there was
an increase of revenue in this department in
1873 over the previous year of $1,674,411, and
an increase of the cost of carrying the mails
and paying the employes of 83,041,Â­
476.9I. The report of the Postmaster
General gives interesting statistics of his
department, and compares them with the corÂ­
responding statistics of a year ago, showing a
growth in every branch of the department. A
postal convention has been concluded with
New South Wales, an exchange of postal cards
established with Switzerland, and negotiations,
pending for several years past with France,
have terminated in a treaty with that country
which went into effect last August. An InterÂ­
national Postal Congress convened in Berne,
Switzerland, in September last, in which the
United States was represented by an officer of
the Postoffice Department of much experience
and qualification for the position. A conÂ­
vention for the establishment of an international
postal union was agreed upon by the delegates
of the countries represented, subject to the apÂ­
proval of the proper authorities of those counÂ­
tries.
I respectfully direct your. attention to the reÂ­
port of the Postmaster General, and to his
suggestions in regard to an equitable adjustÂ­
ment of the question of compensation to railÂ­
roads for carrying the mails.
THE SOUTHERN TROUBLES.
Your attention will be drawn to the unsettled
condition of the Southern States. On the 14th
of September last, the Governor of Lcduisiana
called upon me, as provided by the constitution

 and laws of the United States, .to aid in supÂ­ pl
pressing domestic violence in that state. This m
call was made in view of a proclamation issued tl
on that day by D. C. Penn, stating that,he was ai
elected lieutenant-governor in 1872, and.calling w
upon the militia of the state to arm, assemble h
and drive from power the usurpers, as he desigÂ­ ti
nated the officers of the state government. On d
the day I issued my proclamation I commanded c,
the insurgents to disperse within five days from ei
the date thereof, and subsequently learned that ti
on that day they had taken forcible possession a
of the Statehouse. Steps were taken by me to
support the existing and recognized state govÂ­
ernment, but before the expiration of the five
days the insurrectionary movement was practi
cally abandoned, and the officers of the sta
""!
government, with some minor exceptions.
sumed their powers and duties. Consid
that the present state administration of I sngn
ana has been the only government in t
,e
for nearly two years; that it has be a' stacite
acknowledged and acquiesced in r a scitlh by
Congress and more than once expr .est h
recoÂ­
nized by me. I regarded it as n
. ler duty
when legally called upon for th at purpose, to
prevent its overthrow by an ar' .,ed mob, under
pretence of fraud and irregulr
- in the elecÂ­
tton of 1S72.
I have heretofore called t attention of ConÂ­
gress to this subject, statir ~ that on account of
frauds and forgeries cony .iAitted at said election,
and because it appears That the returns thereof
I were ne-'er legally cu'.invassed, it was impossible:
t to tell thereby who were chosen. But from the
best sources of inf'jrmation at my command, I
have always believed the present state.officers
received : majority of the legal votes cast at
that elee tion. I repeat what I said in my
t special t nessage of Feb. 13, 1873, that in the
e event of no action by Congress, I must continue
to a:eco'gnize the government heretofore recogÂ­
I
nized 'oy me.
I regret to say that, with the preparations for
s he late election, decided indications appeared
in some localities in the Southern States of a deÂ­
termination, by acts of malice and intimidation,
to deprive citizens of the freedom of the ballot
e
because of their political opinions. Bands of
men masked and armed made their appearÂ­
e ance, white leagues and other societies were
formed, large quantities of arms and ammuniÂ­
tion were imported and distributed to these orÂ­
e
ganizations, military drills with menacing demÂ­
s onstrations held, and with all these murders
o
enough were committed to spread terror among
s
those whose political action was to be supÂ­
e pressed. if possible. By these intolerant and
e
criminal proceedings, in some places, colored
n
laborers were compelled to vote according to
-the wishes of their employers under threats of
I discharge if they acted otherwise; and there are
s too many instances in which, when those
e threats were disregarded, they were remorse.
I
lessly executed by those by whom made.
s I understand that the Fifteenth Amendment to
the Constitution was made to prevent this and a
like state of things, and the act of May 31, 1870.,
was passed to enforce its provisions, the object
of this being to guarantee to all citizens the
right to vote and to protect them in the ,free enÂ­
r
joyment of that right. Enjoined by the ConÂ­
stitution to take care that the laws be faithfully
3
executed, and convinced by undoubted eviÂ­
dence that violations of said act had been comÂ­
mitted, and that a widespread and flagrant disÂ­
regard of it was contemplated, the proper offiÂ­
cers were instructed to prosecute the offenders,
and troops were stationed at convenient points
to aid those officers, if necessary, in the perÂ­
formance of their official duties. Complaints
are made of this interference by federal authorÂ­
ity, but if said amendment and act do not proÂ­
vide for such interference, under the circumÂ­
stances as above stated, then they are without
meaning, force or eflect, and the whole scheme
of colored enfranchisement is worse than mockÂ­
ery, and little better than a curse. Possibly 1
Congress may find it due to trot h and justice to
ascertain, by means of a committee, whether
the alleged wrongs to colored citizens for politÂ­
ical purposes are real, or the reports thereof
were manufactured for the occasion.
The whole number of troops in the states of t
Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South
Carolina, North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee,
Arkansas, Mississippi, Maryland and Virginia,
at the time of the election, was 4082. This
embraces the garrisons of all the forts from the
Delaware to the Gulf of Mexico.
ARKAxsAS AFFAIRS.
Another trouble has arisen in Arkansas. ArÂ­
ticle 13 of the constitution of the state, which
was adopted in in 1868, and upon the approval
of which, by Congress. the state was restored to
representation as one of the states of the union, c
provides, in effect, that before any amendments
proposed to this constitution shall become a
part thereof, they shall be passed by two sucÂ­
cessive assemblies, and then submitted to and t
ratified by a majority of the voters thereon. On
the 11th of May, 1874, the Governor convened
an extra session of the General Assembly of


the state, whichn on the 1th of the same month f
passed an act providing for a. convention to f
form a new constitution. Pursuant to this act, f,
and at an election held on the 30th of June,
1874, the convention was approved, and deleÂ­ c
gates were chosen thereto, who assembled on t
the 14th day clay of last July and formed
a new constitution, the schedule of which g
provided for the election of an entire new
set of state officers in a manner contrary
to the existing election laws of the
state. On the 13th of October, 1874, this
a
constitution, as therein provided, was presented a
to the people for their approval or rejection, e
and, according to the election returns, was np tÂ­
proved by a large majority of those qualifiel
to vote thereon; and at the same election per. C
sons were chosen to fill all the state and county
and township offices. The governor elected in f
1874 for the term of four years turned over his c
office to the governor chosen under the new
constitution, whereupon the lieutenant-governor, ii
also elected in 1872 for the term of four years, t
claiming to act as governor, and alleging that b
said proceedings by which the new constitution
was made, and a new set of officers elected,
were unconstitutional, illegal and void, called
upon me, as provided in section 4, article 4 of
the constitution, to protect the state against doÂ­
t(
mestic violence.
As Congress is now investigating the political S
affairs of Arkansas, I have declined to interÂ­ n
fere. The whole subject of executive interÂ­ a
ference with the affairs of a state is repugnant
to public opinion, to the feelings of those g
who from their official capacity must be used in 9
such interposition, and to him or those who <
must direct, unless most clearly on the side of a
law, such interference becomes a crime. With
the law to support it, it is condemned without a b
hearing. I desire, therefore, that all necessity
for executive direction in local affairs may beÂ­ 9
come unnecessary and obsolete.
I invite the attention, not of Congress, but of
the people of the United States, to the causes
and effects of these unhappy questions. Is b
there not a disposition on one side to magnify
wrongs and outrages, and on the other side to s'
belittle them or justify them ? If public opinÂ­
ion could be devoted to a survey of what is,
and to rebuking wrong and aiding the proper
authorities in punishing it, a better state of t(
feeling would be inculcated, and the sooner we i
would have that peace which would leave the f2
states free, indeed, to regulate their own doÂ­ C
mnestic affairs. I believe on the part of our t
citizens of the Southern States (the better part P
of them) there is a disposition to be law-abidÂ­ e'
ing, and to do no violence either to individuals s]
or to the laws existing. But do they do right P
in ignoring the existence of violence and bloodÂ­ r,
shed in resistance .to constituted authority ? I u
sympathize with their prostrated condition, and P
would do all in my power to relieve them, acÂ­ e:
knowledging that in some instances they have d
had most trying governments to live under, and
very oppressive ones in the way of taxation for P
nominal improvements, not giving benefits A
equal to the hardships imposed But can they
proclaim themselves entirely unblamable for a'
this condition ? They cannot. VioÂ­ a
lence has been rampant in some a2
localities, and has either been justified P
or denied by those who could have P
prevented it. 'The theory is raised that there fO
is to be further interference on the part of the fl
general government to protect citizens within 01
a state where the state authorities fail to give ,g

 protectio mn This is
.
main exe cutive, ar' :great mistake. While I reÂ­
the provisions of i the laws of .Congress and
amendments a the constitutioh, 'includiTg .the
with rigor, wi - ded thereto;, will\ be cnforced
have added .di but regret that' they should
ties and po oe jot or tittle to the executive duÂ­
discussior wers. Let there be fairness in the
cates of a of the Southern questions, the advoÂ­
est, try both or all political parties giving honÂ­
the ithful reports of occurrences condemning
all w,ong and upholding the right, and soon
Pill be well.

THE ATTORNEY-GExERAL'S REPORT.
to The report of the Attorney-General contains
er
valuable recommendations relating to the adÂ­
cÂ­ ministration of justice in the courts of the
United States, to which I invite your attention.:
nÂ­
I respectfully suggest to Congress the propriety
of of increasing the number of judicial districts in
n,
the United States to eleven, the present number
of being nine, and the creation of two additional
le
judges. The territorv to be traversed by the
ie
circuit judges is so great, and the business of
I the courts so steadily increasing, that it is
rs
growing more and more impossible for them to
at keep up with the business requiring their atÂ­
.y
tention. Whether this would involve the neÂ­
ie cessity of adding two more justices to the SuÂ­
le
preme Court to the present number, I submit to
rÂ­
the judgment of Congress.
INTERIOR DEPARTMENT.
)r
The attention of Congress is invited to the
d report of the Secretary of the Interior, and to
the legislation asked for by him. The domestic
interests of the people are more intimately conÂ­
)t
nected with this department than with any of
if the other departments of government. Its
, duties have been added to from time to time,
e
until they have become so onerous that, withÂ­
out the most perfect system and order, it will be
impossible for any Secretary of the Interior to
:keep trace of all official transactions having
s his sanction and done in his name, and for
which he is held ;personally responsible.
THE INDIAN POLICY.
d
The policy adopted for the management of
d
Indian affairs, known as the peace policy, has
o
been adhered to with most beneficial results
,f
It is confidently hoped that a few years more
e
will save our frontiers from Indian depredations.
eI commend the recommendation of the Secretary
for the extension of the homestead laws to the
Indians, and for some sort of territorial governÂ­
p
ment for the Indian Territory. A great majorÂ­
ity of the Indians occupying this territory are
believed to be incapable of maintaining their
t
rights against the more civilized and enlightÂ­
ened man. Any territorial form of government
given them, therefore, should protect them in
their homes and property for a period of at least
twenty years, and before its final adoption should
be ratified by a majority of those affected. The
report of the Secretary of the Interior, herewith
attached, gives much interesting statistical inÂ­
formation, which I abstain from giving an abÂ­
stract of, but refer you to the report itself.
PENSIONS.
The act of Congress prescribing the oath
which pensioners must subscribe before drawing
their pensions. cuts off from this bounty a few
survivors of the war of 1812 residing in the
Southern States. I recommend the restoration '
of this bounty to all such. The number of perÂ­ I
sons wnhose names would be restored to the list
of pensioners is not large. They are all old
persons who could have taken no part in the (
rebellion, and the services for which they were
awarded pensions were in defense of the whole
country.
THE CENTENNIAL.
The report of the Commissioner of AgriculÂ­ c
ture, herewith submitted, contains suggestions v
of much interest to the general public, and reÂ­ i
fers to the approaching .Centennial, and the ft
part this department is ready to take in it. I c
feel.that the nation at large is interested iri havÂ­ v
ing this exposition a success, and commend to e
Congress such action as will secure a greater t
interest in it. Already foreign nations have si
signified their intention to be represented at it. .
It may be expected that every civilized nation
will be represented. t
THE CIVIL SERVICE. V
The rules adopted to improve the civil service
of the government have been adhered to as
closely as has been practicable, with the oppoÂ­
sition with which they met. The effect of it
has been asserted on the whole, and has tended
to the elevation of the service, but it is imÂ­
practicable to maintain them without the diÂ­
rect and positive support of Congress. GeneralÂ­ c


a...., rou vii ""u LU1 tID

from those who give their support only to find a,
fault when the rules are apparently departed
from. Removals from office without preferring f
charges against parties removed are frequently
cited as departures from the rules adopted, and t4
the retention of those against whom charges are ii
made by irresponsible persons, and without s
good grounds, is also often condemned as a vioÂ­
lation of them. I announce that if Congress adÂ­
t
journs without positive legislation on the subÂ­
ject of civil service reform, I will regard such
action as a disapproval of the system,
and will abandon it except so far as to require
examinations for certain appointees to determine
their fitness. Competitive examinations will be t.
:hm:ndoned The gentlemen who have given e
their services without compensation, as memÂ­ F
hers of the board to devise rules and regulations F
for the government of the civil service of the F
country, have shown much zeal-and earnestness I
in their work, and to them. as well as to myself,
it will be a source of mortification if it is to be
thrown away. But I repeat that it is impossiÂ­
ble to carry this system to a successful issue j
without general approval and assistance, and I
positive law to support it. F
CHEAP TRANSPORTATION.
I have stated that the elements of prosperity
to the nation's capital-labor, skilled and unÂ­
skilled, and the products of the soil-still reÂ­ j
main with us. To direct the employment of I
these is a problem deserving the most serious F
attention of Congress. If employment can be I
given to all labor offering itself, prosperity neÂ­
cessarily follows. I have expressed the opinÂ­
ion, and repeat it, that the first requisite to the
accomplishment of this end is the substitute of
a sound currency for one of a fluctuating value.
This secured there are many interests that might
be fostered to the great profit of both labor and I
capital. How to induce capital to employ labor
is the question. The subject of cheap transporÂ­
tation has occupied the attention of Congress.
New light on the question will, without doubt, E
be given by the committee appointed by the
last Congress to investigate and report upon this
subject.
OCEAN TRAFFIC.
A revival of shipbuilding, and particularly of
iron-steamship building, is of vast importance 1
to our national prosperity. The United States
is now paying over $1,000,000 per annum for A
freights and passage on foreign ships, to be
carried abroad and expended in the employÂ­
ment and support of other people, beyond a fair
percentage of what should go to foreign vessels
D
estimating on the tonnage and travel of each reÂ­
spectively. It is to be regretted that this disÂ­
parity in the carrying trade exists, and to corÂ­
rect it I would be willing to see a great departÂ­
ure from the usual course of government in supÂ­
porting what might usually be termed ""private
enterprise"". I would not suggest, as a remedy,
direct subsidy to American steamship lines, but
I would suggest the direct offer of ample comÂ­
pensation for carrying the mails betiween the
Atlantic seaboard cities :and the continent bon
American owned and American built steamers, F
and would extend the liberality to vessels F
carrying mails to South America and Mexico, F
and would pursue the same policy from our F
Pacific seaports to foreign seaports on the F
Pacific. It might be demanded that vessels
for this service should come up to a standard
fixed by legislation in tonnage, speed, and all F
other qualities looking to the possibility of the
government requiring them at some time for

 eÂ­ r purposes. The right, also of taking
d session of them -in sucliEmergency should b
he
guarded. I toffer:
these sggestions, believin
td
'them worthy of cdnsiderato, in all seriousnes~
Id affecting all sectins and allinteiests alike.
uÂ­ If anything better can be doiheto direct th.
le
country into a course of general prosperity. n,
'oÂ­ one will be more ready than I to second th.
nÂ­ plan.
g TIIE DISTRICT .GOVERNMENT.
an
Forwarded herewith will be found the repor
of the commissioners appointed under an act o
es Congress, approved June 20, 1874, to wind ul
is the affairs of the district government. It wil.
an be seen from the report tihat the total debt C
es the District of Columbia, less securities or
aÂ­ hand and available, is:
ad
Bonded debt prior to July 1, 1874,. $S,SS3..
it. 940.43; 3-65 bonds by act of Congress June 20.
is 1S74, $2,088,168.73; certificates of the .Boaro'
IiÂ­ of Audit, $4,770,557.45; total, $15,742,667.61;
:i
less special improvement assessments chargenÂ­
- ble to private property in excess of any demand
against such assessment $1,614,054.37"" less
Chesapeake & Ohio Canal bonds. 875,000.C00,
us
and Washington & Alexandria Railroad bonds,
dÂ­ $59,000,000: in the hands of the commissioners
ie of the sinking funds, $1,748,054.37, leaving the
,n. actual debt, less said assets, $13,994,613.24. In
ty addition to this there are claims preferred
in against the government of the district amount
er ing in the aggregate, reported by the
l Board of Audit, to $3,147.787.48, of which
he the greater part will probably be rcjected.
of This sum can, with no more proÂ­
is priety, be included in the debt of the district
to government than can the thousands of claim:s
itÂ­
against the general government be included:as
eÂ­ a portion of the national debt. But the aggreÂ­
1Â­ gate sum thus stated includes something more
to than the funded debt chargeable exclusively
to
the District of Columbia. The act of Congress
of Nov. 28, 1874, contemplate.s an apportionÂ­
ic ment between the UTnited States Government
to and the District of Columbia, in respect of the
ic payment of the principal and interest of the
nÂ­
3.65 bonds. Therefore, in computing with preÂ­
of cision the bonded debt of the district, of the
s aggregate sums above stated, as respects 3.65
, bonds new issued, the outstanding certificates of
- the Board of Audit, and the unadjusted claims
e pending before that board, should be reduced
to tothe extent of the amount which should be apÂ­
ig
portioned to the United States Government in
r the manner indicated in the act of Congress of
June 20, 1874.
I especially invite your attention toÂ­ the reÂ­
Af
commendation of the commissioners of the
is sinking fund relative to the ambiguity of the
s
act of June 20, 1874, the interest on the disÂ­
e trict bonds and the consolidation of indebtedÂ­
,.
ness to the district. I feel much indebted to
Sthe gentlemen who consented to leave their
e private affairs and come from a distance to atÂ­
tend to the business of this district, and for the
able and satisfactory manner in which it has
e been conducted. I'am sure their services will
r be generally appreciated by the entire country.
It will be seen from the accompanying full
it
report of the Board of Hfealth
that the sanitary
n
condition of the district is very satisfactory.
it
In my opinion, the District of Columbia
d
should be regarded as the grounds df the
e national capital, in which the entire people are
i interested. I do not allude to this to urge genÂ­
eÂ­ rous appropriations to the district, but to draw
the attention of Congress in framing a law for
the morale of the district to the magnificent
scale on which the city was planned by the
1
founders of the government. The manner in
which, for ornamental purposes, the reservaÂ­
v
tions, streets and avenues were laid out, was
a the proportion of the property actually posÂ­
1 sessed by the general government. I think the
proportion of the expenses of the government,
and improvements to be borne by the general
1 government, the cities of Washington and
Georgetown and the country should be careÂ­
fully and equitably defined.
IMPROOVEMIENT OF TI-E MISSISSIPPI.
In accordance with section 3, act approved
June 23, I appointed a. board to make a survey
of the mouth of the Mississippi Rivor with a
view to determine the best method of obtainÂ­
ing and maintaining a depth of water sufficient
for the purpose of commerce, etc., and in acÂ­
cordance with an act entitled ""An act to pro-Â­
vide for the appointment of a commission of
engineers to investigate, and report a plan for
the excavation of the alluvial basin of the MisÂ­
sissippi River sulject to inundation,"" I apÂ­
pointed a commission of engineers. Neither
board has yet completed its labors. When
their reports are received they shall be forÂ­
warded to Congress without delay.

WASHINGTON, D. C., April 15.-The
following is the correspondence between
Secretary Blaine and the Italian governÂ­
ment since the secretary's note to Marquis
Imperali acknowledging notice of Baron
Fava's departure:
RiOYAL LEGATION OF ITALY, WASHÂ­
INGTON, D. C., April 2, 1891.--Mr. SecreÂ­
tary of State: I hasten to acknowledge
the receipt of the note which your exÂ­
cellency did me the honor to address me
on the first instant in reply to that whereÂ­
by Baroa Fava informed you of his deÂ­
parture;on leave. I have laid the con.
tents of your excellency's aforesaid note
before -the government of the king and
his ex llency, the president of the
councilh His majesty's minister of
foreign affairs has just directed me to adÂ­
dress the following communication to
you: The government of the King of
Italy has asked nothing beyond the
prompt institution of judicial proceedÂ­
ings through the regular channels. It
would have been absurd to demand the
punishment of the guilty parties without
the warrant of regular judgment. The
Italian government repeats the same
demand. Not until the federal governÂ­
ment shall have explicitly declared that
the aforesaid proceedings shall be
promptly begun can the diplomatic inciÂ­
dent be considered closed. Meanwhile
his majesty's government takes note. of
the declaration whereby the federal gov-,
ernment recognized that an indemnity is
due to the families of the victims in
virtue of the treaty in force between the.
two countries. I have therefore the
honor tdO bring the .foregoing, to the
knowledte Af 'your ,excelldic and .I
avail myself of this cccasion to offer you,
Mr. Secretary of the State, the assurances
of my highest and most respectful conÂ­
sideration.
[Signed.] IMPERIALI.
To His Excellency, James G. Blaine,
Secretary of State.
DEPARTMENT OF STATE, WASHINGTON,
D. U., April 14, 1891.-The Marquis ImÂ­
periali, charge d'affaires, etc., etc., etc.Â­
Sm:--I have the honor to acknowledge
the receipt of your note dated Thursday,
April 2,1891. It contains a second teleÂ­
gram from the Marquis Rudini, a part of
which I here quote: ""The government
of the king of Italy has asked nothing
beyond the prompt institution of judiÂ­
cial proceedings through the regular
channels. It would have been absurd to
claim the punishment of the guilty parÂ­
ties without the warrant of a regular
judgment. The Italian government now
repeats the same demand. Not until the
federal government shall have explicitly
declared that the aforesaid proceedings
shall be promptly began can the diploÂ­
matic incident be considered as closed.""
This government certainly had no desire
whatever to change the meaning of the
Marquis Rudini's telegram of March 24.
It was delivered at the state department
by Baron Fava in person, written in his
own hand and expressed in the English
language. The following is the full text
of the telegram:
""ROIE, March 24, 1891.--Italian MinÂ­
ister, Washington: Our requests to the
federal government are very simple.
Some Italian subjects acquitted by the
American magistrates have been murÂ­
dered in prison while under the immediÂ­
ate protection of the authorities. Oucr
right therefore to demaand and obtain the
punishment, of the murderers and indemnity
fos the victims is unquestionable. I wish to
add that the public opinion in Italy is
justly impatient and if concrete provisÂ­
ions were not at once taken I should find
myself inthe painfal necessity of showing
openly our dissatisfaction by recalling
the minister of his majesty from a counÂ­
try where he is unable to obtain justice.'.
[Signed,] RUDINI.""
The words underscored are precisely
those which I quoted in my former note,
and I am directed by the president to
express the satisfaction of this governÂ­
ment with the very material qualification
of the demand made by the Marquis
Rudini on behalf of the Italian governÂ­
ment. You quote in your note another
part of the Marquis Rudini's telegram of
April 2, in these words: ""Meanwhile
his majesty's government takes note of
the declaration whereby the federal
government recognizes that an indemnity
is due to the families of the victims in
virtue of the treaty in force between the
two countries."" If the Marquis Rudini
will carefully examine my note
of April 1st he will discover
that I did not ""recognize that an indem
nit.v is due to the fnmilin nf th, n ro.


tims in virtue of the treaty in force beÂ­
tween the two countries."" What I did
say was in answer to Baron Fava's asserÂ­
tion tnat the United States government
refused to take this demand for indemniÂ­
ty into consideration. I quote my reply:
""The United States, so far from refusing,
has distinctly recognized the principle of
indemnity to those Italian subjects wcho
may have been. wronged by a violation of
rights secured to them under the treaty with
the United States conclitded February 26,
1871."" The Marquis Rudini may
be assured that the United States
would recompense every Italian subject
whb might ""be wronged by a violation of
a treaty"" to which the faith of the United
States is pledged. But this assurance




 leaves unsettled the important question
whether the treaty has been violated.
Upon this point the president, with sufÂ­
ficient facts placed before him, has taken
full time for decision. He now directs
that certain*considerations on the generÂ­
al subject be submitted to the judgment
of the Italian government as a precedent
of great value to the case under discusÂ­
sion. The president recalls the concluÂ­
sion maintained by Mr. Webster in 1851
when he was secretary of state finder
President Fillmore. In August of that
year a mob in New Orleans demolished
the building in which the
Spanish consul was located and at
the same time attacks were
made upon coffee houses and cigar shops
kept by Spanish subjects. American
citizens were involved in. the losses,
which in the aggregate were large. The
supposed cause of the mob was the intelÂ­
ligence of the execution of fifty young
Americans in Havana and the banishÂ­
ment to the Spain mines of nearly 200
citizens of the United States. The vicÂ­
tims were all members of the abortive
Lopez expedition. In consequence of
these depredations of the mob upon the
property of the Spanish consul, as well
as against the Spanish subjects,. Do,
Calderon de La Parce, the minister of
Spain, demanded indemnity for the
losses, both official and personal.
Mr. Webster admitted that the
Spanish consul was entitled
to indemnity and assured the
Spanish minister that if the injured conÂ­
sul, Mr. LaBarde, ""shall return to his
post, or if any other consul for New OrÂ­
leans shall be appointed by her Catholic
majesty's government, the officers of this
government resident in that city will be
instructed to receive and treat him with
courtesy and with a national salute to the
flag of his ship, if he shall arrive in a
Spanish vessel, as a demonstration of reÂ­
spect such as may signify to him and to
his government the sense entertained by
the government of the United States of
the gross injustice done to his predecesÂ­
sor by a lawless mob, as well as the indigÂ­
nity and insult offered by it to a
foreign. state with which the United
States are and wish ever to remain
on terms of the most respectful and
pacific intercourse."" But when pressed
by the Spanish minister to afford
idemnity to Spanish subjects injured by
the mob in commoah with American
citizens, Mr. Webste4 declined to accede
to the demand and have his reasons as
follows: ""This government supposes
that the rights of the Spanish consul, a
public officer residing here under the
protection of the United States governÂ­
ment, are quite different from those of
the Spanish subjects who have come into
the country to mingle with our own
citizens and here to pursue their private
business and objects. The former may
claim special indemnity, the latter are
entitled to such protection as is a forde(
So it, own citizens. -While,Â­ therefdor,
the losses of individual private
Spanish subjects are greatly to be
regretted, yet it is understood that many
American citizens suffered equal losses
from the same cause, and these private
individual subjects of her Catholc maÂ­
jesty coming voluntarily to reside in the
United States have certainly no cause of
complaint if they are protected by the
same laws and the same administration
of law as native born citizens of this
country. They have, in fact, some adÂ­
vantages over the citizens of the state in
which they happen to be, inasmuch as
they are enabled until they become citiÂ­
zens themselves to prosecute for any in
juries done to their persons or property
in the courts of the United States or the
state courts at their election."" It is proper,
however, to add that two years alter Mr.
Webster wrote the foregoing note conÂ­
gress, in recognition of certain magnaniÂ­
mous conduct on the part of the queen of
Spain on pardons bestowed upon AmeriÂ­
cans who had unjustifiably invaded the
Island of Cuba, enacted a joint resoluÂ­
tion, approved by President Fillmore,
March 2, 1853, the last day of his term,
indemnifying the Spanish consul and
other Spanish subjects for the loss susÂ­
tained in the New Orleans mob of 1851.
The considerations upon which this resÂ­
olution was passed were held not to conÂ­
travene the original position of Mr.
Webster, shared also by President FillÂ­
more. The right to judicial remedy
which MIr. Webster assured to the
Spanish subjects is likewise asÂ­
sured to the Italian subjects. The
right is specially granted in the second
section of the third article of the constiÂ­


tution, and as Mr. Webster points out,
the resident alien has a privilege which
is denied to the citizen. The widows and
children of the citizens who lose their
lives by mob violence may sue the leadÂ­
ers and members of the mob only in the
courts of the state of Louisiana; while
the.widows and children of the Italian
subjects who suffered death have the
right to sue each member of the mob,
not only in the state courts, but also beÂ­
fore the federal tribunals for the district
of Louisiana. Provision is made in the
revised civil code of Louisiana for redress
of such grievances as the widows and
children of the victims of the mob may
plead. I quote:
""Article 2314-Every act whatever of
man that causes damage to another
obliges him by whose fault it happens to
repair; the right of this action shall surÂ­
vive, in case of death, in favor of the
minor children and widow of the deÂ­
ceased, or either of them, and in default
of these in favor of the surviving father
or mother, or either of them, for the
space of one year from death.""
""Article 2316-Every person is responÂ­
sible for the damage he oscasions, not
merely by his act, but by his negligence,
his imprudence, or his want of skill.""
""Article 2334-He who causes another
person to do an unlawful act, or assists
or encourages in the commission of it, is
answerable in solide with that person for
the damage caused by such act.""
The government of the.United States
would feel justified on the argument of
this conclusion of Mr. Webster if the
mob of March 14,1891, did. not in some
of its characteristics differ from the mob
of 1851. But it is due to entire candor,
due to this government and due to the
government of Italy to point out certain
differences of which the.government of
the United States is honorably bound to
take notice. In the case of the mob of
1851 Mr. Webster asserts that ""no perÂ­

sonal injury was offered to anyone; that
the police and other legal authorities did
all that was possible to preserve the peace
and arrest the rioters; that the mob acted
in the heat of blood and not in the
pursuance of any predetermined plan or
purposes of injury or insult; that the
mob was composed of irresponsible
persons, the names of none of whom are
known to the government of the United
States, nor as far as the government is
informed to its officers or agents in New
Orleans."" As soon as possible after the
lamentable occurence at New Orleans
the president directed the attorney
general to cause through his department
a full inquiry to be made into all the
facts connected therewith and solicited
his opinion as to whether criminal proÂ­
ceedings would lie under the federal
laws in the federal courts against persons
charged with the killing of Italian subÂ­
jects. He has not yet received the
official report.. If it be found that a
prosecution can be maintained under the
statutes of the United States
the case will be presented to the
next grand jury according to the
usual methods of criminal administration,
but if it should be found, as seems probÂ­
able, that criminal proceedings can only
be taken in the courts of Louisiana, the
president. can in this direction do no
more than to urge upon the state officers
the duty of promptly bringing the
offenders to trial. This was done in his
telegram to the governor of Louisiana as
early as the 15th of March. If it shall
result that the case can be prosecuted
only in the state courts of Louisiana and
the usual judicial investigation and proÂ­
cedure under the criminal law is not
resorted to, it will then be the duty of
the United States to consider whether
some other form of rediess may be
asked. It is understood that the state
grand jury is now investigating
the affair, and while it is posÂ­
sible that the grand jury may
fail to present indictments,
the United States cannot assume that
such will be the case. The United
States did not by the treaty with Italy beÂ­
come the insurer of the lives or property
of Italian subjects within our territory.
No government is able, however high its
civilization, however vigilant its -police
supervision, however severe its criminal
code and however prompt and inflexible
its criminal administration to secure its
own citizens against violence promoted
by individual malice or by sudden popuÂ­
lar tumult. The foreign resident must
be content in such case to share the same
- dres that is offered by the law to the
citizen and D no just cause of comÂ­
plaint or right to ask the IutlÂ°eosition of
his country ii the courts are equally op;%""
-to him for the redress of his injuries.
The treaty in the first, second, third, and
notably in the twenty-third articles,
clearly limits the rights guaranteed to
the citizens of the contracting powers In
the territory of each to equal treatment
and to free access to the courts of justice.
Foreign residents are not made a favored
class. It is not believed that Italy would
desire a more stringent construction of
her duty under theÂ­ treaty. Where the
injury inflicted upon a foreign resident
is not the act of the government or its
officers, but of an individual or a mob, it
is not believed that a claim for indemnity
can justly be made unless it shall be
made to appear that the public authoriÂ­
ties charged with the peace of the comÂ­
munity have connived at the unlawful
act, or, having timely notice of the
threatened danger, have been guilty of
such gross negligence in the taking of
necessary precautions as to amount to
connivance. If, therefore, it should apÂ­
pear that among those killed by the mob
at New Orleans there were some Italian
subjects who were resident or domiciled
in that city agreeably to our treaty with
Italy and not in violation of our immiÂ­
gration laws, and who were abiding in
the peace of the United States and obeyÂ­
ing the laws thereof and of the
state of Louisiana, and that the
public officers charged with the
duty of protecting life and property
in that the city connived at the work of
the mob, or upon proper notice or inforÂ­
mation of the threatened danger failed to
take any steps for the preservation of

guilty to trial, the president would under
such circumstances feel that a case was
established that should be submitted to
the consideration of congress with a view
to' the relief of the families of the Italian
subjects who had lost their lives by lawÂ­
less violence. Accept, sir, the renewed
assurance of my high consideration.

There are several significant features
in the correspondence made public toÂ­
day in addition to the diplomatic arguÂ­
ment proper In the first place there
should be noted the almost absolute corÂ­
respondence of the text of Rudini's note
with the statement of its contents cabled
from Rome by the Associated Press.
There are slight differences in versions,
but these are explained by the fact that
the translations of the Italian. dispatch
into English were made by different perÂ­
sons and the substance is precisely alike
in either case. It will be observed that
the. Marquis Imperiali personally acÂ­
knowledges the receipt of Mr. Blaine's
letter respecting Fava's departure; that
while he transmits Rudini's views they
are over his own signature, and that SecÂ­
'rotary Blaine in his last letter, April 14,
addressed himself to the Marquis ImpeÂ­
riali. These facts may. be regarded as
final evidence that so far from diplomatic
relations-between the two countries havÂ­
ing been interrupted they are pracÂ­
.. tiCaly on the same footing as
if the minister .had not quitted
Washington, for the marquis. appeared
to be discharging the full functions of
the affairs and also as minister. He reÂ­
ceived Secretary Blaine's note last night,
but its publication was .deferred until toÂ­
day in order to observe the proprieties
and afford opportunity to the Marquis
Imperiali to transmit the note by cable
to his governmeht in advance of its publiÂ­
cation to the world. Secretary Blaine's
note contains internal evidence that this
government has not been threatened
if an answer was delayed,
or of a disregard for such a threat
if it were
. made, in the leisurely
manner in which he states that the presiÂ­
dent ""has taken full time for consideraÂ­
;tion"" of the treaty questions involved. It
is a lso noticed that the secretary promptÂ­
ly checks the attempt made by Rudini to
Scommit.the United States to a promise to
pay indemnity by poiintingto the guarded
language of his first dispatch and indulgÂ­
ing in a number of qualifications, ""the

demonstration of. several matters that

the guilty parties in its own tribunals,

THE EXCESS OP REVENUE.
T Ihn M.-An,ma Jm IIia flata! wasw n. 1.1.1.
will end on Juno 30, 1885, be estimated upon
the basis of existing laws, the Seoretary is of
the opinion that for that year the receipts
will exceed sixty millions, the ordinary exÂ­
penditures Including the amount devoted to
tne sinking tunas, uttnerto tne surplus as
rapidly as it has accumulated has been deÂ­
votod to the reduction of the National
debt. As a result the only bonds now outÂ­
standing which are redeemable at the pleasure
of the irovernment are tho three nor cents.
amounting to about $305,000,000, four and one
half per cents, amounting to $250,000,000, and
the $737,000,000 four per cents are not payable
until isi nna iiwi, respectively, iitnosurpius
shall hereafter be as large ns the Treasury
estimates now indicate, the three per cent,
bonds may all be redeemed at least four years
before anv of the four and one half per cents,
can be called tn. The latter, at the same rate
of aooumulation, can be paid at maturity nnd
the money requisite for the redemption of the
tour per cents, will be In the Treasury many
years before those obligations become payÂ­
able. PAYING THB DEBT TOO PAST.
There are cogent reasons, however, why the
National Indebtedness should not be thus
rapidly extinguished. Chief among them is
the f not that only by excessive taxation Is
such rapidity attainable. In a communication
to the Congress at its last session I recomÂ­
mended that all excise taxes be abolished exÂ­
cept those relating to distilled spirits, and that
substantial reductions siso oe made in the
revenues from customs. A statute has since
been enacted by which the annual tax and
tariff receipts of the Government have been
out down to the extent of at least fifty or
sixty millions of dollars.
NO FURTHER REDUCTION. f
While I have no doubt that still further reÂ­
ductions may be mado I do not advise the
adoption at this session of any measures for a
large diminution of National revenues. The
results of the legislation of the lost session of
Congress have not as yet become sufficiently
apparent to justify any radical revision or
sweeping modifications of the existing law.
DISPOSING OP THE SURPLUS.
In the interval which must elapse before the
effects of the act of March 3, 1883, can be defiÂ­
nitely ascertained a portion at least of the
surplus revenues may be wisely applied to
the long neglected duty of rehabitatlng our
Nation and providing coast defenses for the
protection oi our noruors.

TRE RATIONAL CCRHENC.
This Is mailer 10 which I sbailaa-aln revert.

Immtvllaiely saeoclated with too fluanctal sub
net just aiscuwed Is the Imp-irtiuit queitioa,
M hat legislation Is nce.loJ regarding National
eurrency t 'be agzregaie amount of bonH
now on deposit la tun T.vaAury to support tbs
Mstlonal bank circulation is $i.ai.uOJ,uh.
Nearly two hundred millions of this amount
roiul-U ot three oer cents., which, as already
stated, are payaMe at the pleasure of the Uov-
rrnmeoi inn are uaeiy to us cauoain witoin
less than four years unless the surplus revÂ­
enues shall be diminhed.
CONTRACTING .-US CURRENCY.
The probable eifect of such an extensive
retirement of the securities which are lbs
hauls or the National bauk circulation would
be such a contraction of the volume of curÂ­
rency as to produce grave commercial embarÂ­
rassmeuts. How can the danger be obvla'.edf
The most effectual plan, and one whoso adopÂ­
tion at the earliest practicable opportunity I
snail neanuy aoprove, nas aireauy uecn minÂ­
es tel. If tho revenues of the next four years
shall be kept substantially commensurate
wih the exuenses the volume of circulation
will not be likely to suffer any material disÂ­
turbance, but if, on the other hand, there
shall be groat delay In reducing taxation it
will become necessary either to substitute
some other form of currency In place of the
National bank notes, or to mako important
changes in the laws by which their circulaÂ­
tion Is now controlled.
THE LEGISLATION NEEDED.
In my Judgment the latter course Is far
preferable. I commend te your attention the
very interesting and thoughtrul suggestions
upon this subject which appear In the SecreÂ­
tary's report. The objections which bo urges
against the acceptance of any other securities
than the obligations ot the Government Itself
as a foundation for National bank circulaÂ­
tion, seem to me insuperable.
THE TWO PLANS.
For averting the threatened contraction two
courses have been suggested, either of whloh
Is probably feasible, one is the issuanca of
new bonds, having many years to run, bearing
a low rate of Interest exchangeable upon
specified terms of those now outstanding The
other course which commend itself to my own
Judgment as the hotter, Is the enactment of a
aw repealing the tax on circulation and perÂ­
mitting ihe banks to issue notes for an amount
eipial to ninety per cent, ot the market value,
Instead as of now, the face value of their
deposited bonds. I agree with the Secretary
in tne oenei that the adoption ol tnia plan
would afford the necessary relief.
TUB TRADE DOLLAR.
The trade dollar was coined for the purpose
ot traffic in countries where silver passed at
its vaiue, as ascertained oy its wcigntami nneÂ­
ness. it never had a legal tender quality.
Large numbers of these coins entered, howÂ­
ever, into the volume of our ourrency. By
common consent their circulation In domestic
trade has now ceased and they have thus beÂ­
come a disturbing element and they thould
not be longer porinitted to embarrass our curÂ­
rency system. I recommend that provision
for the.r reception by tho Treasury and the
mints as bullion at a small per oentnge above
the current market price of silver of like fineÂ­
ness.CONSOLIDATING CUSTOMS DISTRICTS.
The Secretary of the Treasury advises tho
consolidation of certain of the customs disÂ­
tricts of the country and suggests that tho
President be vested with such power in relaÂ­
tion thereto as is now given him in respect to
Collectors of Internal Revenue by soction 3141
of the revised statutes. The statutes on this
subject, which are contained in his report,
furnished of themselves a strong argument in
defense of his views. At the adjournment of
Congress the number of Internal Revenue
collection districts was 1,260. By executive
orders dated June 25, 1883, 1 decided that cerÂ­
tain of these districts be consolidated. The
result has been a reduction ot one-third their
number, whloh at present Is but 830.
INDIAN RELATIONS.
From the report of the Secretary of War it
will be seen that in only a single inetanoe has
there been any disturbance of the quiet conÂ­
dition of our Indian tribes a raid from MexiÂ­
co to Arizona by a small party of Indians,
which was pursued by General Crook Into the
mountain regions from which It bad come.
It is confidently hoped that serious outbreaks
will not again occur and that the Indian
tribes which have for so many years disturbed
the West will hereafter remain In peaceable
submission.
DEFENSELESS SEA COASTS.
I again oall your attention to the present
condition of our extended sea coast, upon
which are so many large cities whose wealth
an importance to the country would in ttmo
of war be open to attack from modern arÂ­
mored ships against which our existing deÂ­
fensive works could give no adequate protecÂ­
tion. Those works were built before the InÂ­
troduction of modern heavy rifled guns into
maritime warfare, and if they are not put In
an efficient condition we may easily be subÂ­
jected to humiliation by a hostile power
greatly interior to ourselves.
!' GUNS 'AND TORPEDOES. ,
"" As germain to this subject, I call your atÂ­
tention to the importance of perfecting our
submarine torpedo defenses. The board auÂ­
thorized by the last Congress to report on the
method which should be adopted for the manÂ­
ufacture of heavy ordnance adapted to modÂ­
ern warfare has visited the principal iron and
steel works in this country nnd in Europe.
It is hoped that its report will bo soon made
ana taat uongress -will tnereupon ue aisÂ­
posed to provide suitable facilities and
plans ' for the manufacture of such
guns as are now temporarily needed
ENCOCRAOINO STATE MILITIA.
On several occasions during tho past year
omcersot tne army nave, at tuo request ot tne
state autnonties, visitea tneir military en-
nmpments for inspection oi tne troops, i rom
militia organization by the National Govern
ment would be followed by very gratifying re
sults ana wouia ntrora it in sunaen emergenÂ­
cies the eld of a largo body of volunteers eduÂ­
cated in the performance of military duties.
STRENGTHENING THE NAVY.
The Secretary ot the Navy reports that unÂ­
der the authority of the laws of August 5,
1882, and March 8, 1883, the work of strengthÂ­
eningour navy by the construction of modern
vessels has been auspiciously begun. Three
cruisers are in process of construction tho
Chicago, of 4,500 tons displacement, and the
Boston and Atlanto, each of 2,500 tons. Tbey
are to be built of steel with tho tensile strength
nnd ductility prescribed by law. and in combiÂ­
nation of speed, endurance and armament are
expected to oompare favorably with the best
unarmed war vessels of other nations. A
fourth vessel, the Dolphin, Is to be construct
ed or similar material ana is intended to serve
ss a Beet dispatch boat.
The double turreted monitors Puritan.
Amnhltrite and Terror have been launched
on the Delaware River and a contract has
been made for the supblv of their machinery.
A similar monitor, the Monadnock. has been
launched In California. The Naval Advisory
Board and the Secretary recommend the comÂ­
pletion of the monitors, tho construction of
four gunboats and also of tnree additional
steel vessels like the Chicago, Boston and
Dolphin.
COAST CANALS.
As an important measure of material deÂ­
fense the Secretary urges also the immediate
creation of an interior coast line of water
ways across the peninsula of Florida, along
the coast from Florida to Hampton roads, be
tween tne i nceaponKe nay anu tne ueiaware
river, and through Capo Cod.
A BETTER NAVY NEEDED.
I feel bound to impress upon the attention
of Congress the necessity of continuing proÂ­
gress in the reconstruction of the navy. Tho
condition of the public Treasury, as I have alÂ­
ready intimated, makes the uresent an aus
picious timo for putting this brunch of the
service in a state of efficiency. It is no part
of policy to create a navy able to cope with
that of the other great powers of the world.
Wo have no wish for foreign conquest and
the peace which we have long enjoyed is In no
seeming danger ot Interruption, but that our
naval strength should be made adoquate for
the denfonse of our harbors, the protection of
our commercial interests and the maintenance
of our national honor is a proposition from
whloh no patriotic citizen can witnnoia nis as
sent- .
POSTAL AFFAIRS.
The report of the Postmaster General eonÂ­
tains a gratifying exhibit of the condition
and prospects of the Interesting tiranoh of the
publio service committed to his care. It apÂ­
pears that on June 80, 1883, the whole number
of post-offlces was 47,838; of which 1.6K! were
established during the previous fiscal year.
The number of offices operating under the
system of free delivery was 154. At these
latter offices the postage on local matter
amounted to $419,523,032, a sum exceeding by
$105,189,401 the entire cost of the carriers
service of the oountry. The rate of postage
on drop letters passing through these offices
is now fixed by law at two cents per half ounce
or fraotion thereof.
ONB CENT POSTAGE. !
' In offices where the carrier system has not
been established the rate la only half as large.
It will be remembered that In 1803, when free
delivery was first established by law, the uniÂ­
form single rate postage upon local letters
was one cent, and so It remained until 1872.
when in those cities where carrier service was
established it was increased in order to defray
the expense of such service.
It seems to me the old rate may now with
propriety be restored; and that too even at tho
risk of diminishing for a time at . least the reÂ­
ceipts from postage upon local letters. I can
see no rcusm why tna particular class of

mail matter should be bald aoeoantabto
for the emirs ou-t of not only it own eoliesÂ­
tKM and delivery, but the ottooUoa and dv
livary nf all otlx-r elauaa, and 1 am eoqhdsot

UOVUtliMltkTTBLBflRAPHS. ,
Ths Postmaster General devotes much of his
report to the oooaideratloa, la Its various
upnois,nf the relation ot iha Government
to the telegraph. As such redaction as 1 hv
been sbt to give to this subject siaos my last
annual meawg has not led mo to change ths

view wnicn 1 inere exprosteu in Uiaaenuug
from ths rvonmtnendiuion ot the Postmaster
General, that the Government sutuni m
control over the telegraph which it ha always
exercised over the mail. d mill Ins that Its
authority in the premises is as ample as ha
ever been claimed or It, it wouid not in my
Judgment be wise to usa. If that authority to
purchase or assume tho control of existing
telegraph lines or to construct others with a
view ni entering into a geueral competition
with privato outerprise.
PLANS PROPOSED.
The oblectlons which mav be Justly urc-ed
against either of these projects, and indeed
a.-ainst any system which would require any
enormous Increase in the civil service listed
do not, however, apply to some of the plans
which have lately provoked publio comment
and discussion. It has beon claimed, for exÂ­
ample, that Congress might wisely authorize
the Postmaster Geueral to contract with some
private persons or corporation for the transÂ­
mission of messages at specified rates snd un
der Government supervision. Various such
schemes of some general nature, but widely
differing In their special characteristics, have
been suggested In tho publio prints, aud the
arguments by which they have been suDoorted
and opposed have doubtless attracted your
auuiiuuii.
It is likely that the whole sublect will bs
considered by you at the present session. In
tho nature ot things it involves so many ques
tions oi ueiaii tnut your acuoeratiuus would
particular sua-a-estions which I miirht now
submit. I avow my belief, however, that the
government should be authorized by law to
exercise some sort of supervision over interÂ­
state telegraphic communication and I ex
press tne nope mat tor attaining mat end
some measure may be devised which will re
ceive your approbation.
DEl'AHTMENT OF JUSTICE.
The Attorney General criticises in hlsrennrt
the provisions of the existing law fixing toe
fees of juror and witnesses in the Federal
courts. These provisions are chiefly contained
in the aot of February 28, 1853, though some of
them were introduced into that action from
statutes which had been passed many years
previous. It is manifest such compensation
might, when these laws were enacteJ, have
been just and reasonably would in many in
stances be Justly regarded at the present day
as Inadequate.
l concur with the Attorney Uoneral tn the
belief that the statutes should be revised by
which these fees am regulated. So. ton.
should the laws which regulate the compenÂ­
sation of district attorneys and marshals.
Tbey should be paid wholly by salaries instead
of In part by fees, as Is now the case. The
change would prove to be a measure of econÂ­
omy and would discourage the institution of
newness ana oppressive legal proceedings,
whloh It is to be feared have In some Instances
been conducted for the mere sake of Dersonal
gain.
THB INDIAN QUESTION.
Much Interesting and varied information I
contained in the report of the Secretary of
the Interior. I particularly call your attenÂ­
tion to his presentation of certain phases of
the Indian questions, to his recommendation
for the repeal of the pre-emption and timber
cultivation acts and for more stringent leg
islation to prevent frauds under the pension
laws.
PENSION FRAUDS.
The statutes which proscribe the definition
and punishment of crimes relating to penÂ­
sions could doubtlosa be made more effective
by certain amounts and additions which are
pointed out in the Secretary's report.
ILLITERACY,
I have previously referred to the alarming
state of Illiteracy in certain portions of the
country and again submit for the consideraÂ­
tion of Congress whether some Federal aid
should be extended to publio primary educaÂ­
tion wherever adequate provision therefore
una uot uireaay oeen mane.
THE POLYGAMY PROBLEM.
The Utah Commission has submitted to the
Seoretary of the Interior Its seoond annual
report. As a result of Its labors in supervis
ing the recent election in that Territory purÂ­
suant to the act of March 'ii, 1882, it appears
that the persons by that act disqualified, to the
numborof about 12,0UO, were exoluded from
the noils. This fant. however, afford litt.la
cause for congratulation, anu I fear that It is
far irom Indicating any real nnd sub
stantial progress toward the extirpation
of polygamy. All of the members of
the Legislature are Mormons. There is grave
reason to believe that they are in svmnathr
with the practice that this Government is
seeking to suppress, and that its efforts in that
regard will be more likely to encounter opÂ­
position than receive, their encouragement
ana support, even n mis view snouia hapÂ­
pily be erroneous the law under which the
Commissioners have been acting should
be made more effective by the incorÂ­
poration of some such stringent measures
as thoy recommend as were included in
bill No. 2238 on the calendar of the Senate at
its last session. I am convinced, however,
thajolyJimy has become so strongly en-
tro.l
.f bed Tfi the Territory of Utah thut it is
profitless to attack It with any but the stoutÂ­
est weapons which constitutional legislation
cun fashion. I favor therefore the repeal of
tuo act upon wman tue existing government
depends, the assumption by the National LegÂ­
islikare of the entire politionl control of the
TclP.toriund the establishment of a commisÂ­
sion witipfuch powers and duties as shall be
delegated to It by law.
AGRICULTURAL AFFAIRS.
The Department of Agriculture is accomÂ­
plishing much in the direction of the agricul
tural development of the country and the
report of the Commissioner giving the results
of his investigations and experiments will be
found Interesting and valuable. At his inÂ­
stance R convention of those interested In the
cattle industry of the oountry was lately held
at Chicago, t ne prevalence or pleura pneuÂ­
monia And other contagious diseases of an!
mals was one of the chief topics of discusÂ­
sion. A oommittee of the convention will
invito your co-operation in investigating the
causos of these diseases and providing
methods lor tneir prevention ana cure.
GOVERNMENT FOR ALASKA.
I tru st thnt Congress will not fail In Its pres
ent session to put Aiasza unaer protection oi
law. its people nave repeatedly remonstrated
against our neglect to afford them maintenance
and protection, expressly guaranteed by the
terms of the treaty, whereby thn,t territory
was ceded to the United States, t or sixteen
?ears tbey have pleaded in vain for that which
hey should have received without the asking.
Thoy have no law for the protection of debts,
the support of education, the conÂ­
veyance of property, the adminÂ­
istration ot estates, or the enforcement
of contracts, none indeed for the punishÂ­
ment of criminals except such as offend
against certain customs, commerce and navl
gatlon acts. The resources of Alaska, esÂ­
pecially in fur, mines and lumber, are conÂ­
siderable in extent and capable of largo deÂ­
velopment, while its geograohlcal situation is
one of political and commercial Importance.
The promptings of Interest, therefore, ss
well as considerations of honor and good
faith, demand the immediate establishment
of a civil government in that territory.
INTER-STATE COMMERCE.
Complaints have lately been numerous and
urgent that certain corporations controlling
in whole or In part the facilities for the InterÂ­
State carriage of persons and merchandise
over the great railroads of the oountry have
r 'sorteu in tneir aeaungs witn tne puuuc to
divers measures unjust and oppressive In
their cbaraoter.
In some instances the State governments
have attacked and suppressed these evils, but
In others tbey have been unable to afford adÂ­
equate relief because of the jurisdictional
limitations which are imposed upon them by
the Federal Constitution. The question how
far the National government may lawfully
interfere in the premises, and what. If any
supervision or control It ought to exercise, Is
one which merits your careful consideration,
CHECKING MONOPOLY. '
While we cannot fall to recognize the lm
portance of the vast railway systems of the
oountry and tneir great and beneficial influÂ­
ences upon the development of our material
wealth, we should on the other hand rememÂ­
ber no Individual and no corporation ought to
be invested with absolute power over the InÂ­
terest of any other citizen or class of citizens.
The right of these railway corporations to
award a profitable return upon their InvestÂ­
ments and to reasonable freedom In their reguÂ­
lations must he recognized. But It seems only
just that so far as Its constitutional authority
will permit Congress should protect the people
at large In their Inter-State traffic against aots
of injustice which State Governments are
powerless to protect
PRRHRRVINO THB FORESTS.
In my last annual message I called attention
to tho neoesslty of protecting by suitable legÂ­
islation the forests situated noon the nubile
domain. In many portions of the West the
pursuit of general agriculture is only made
I practicable by resort to Irrigation, while suc-
oessful Irrigation would bo impossible

IHDt'KTRIAL EXPOSITIONS.
The Industrial exhibitions which have been
held In the I'nited States during the present
year attracted attention in many foreign
countries where the announcement of those
enterprises had been made public through the
foreign agencies of this Government. The
Industrial exhibition at Boston and the SouthÂ­
ern exposition at Louisville were largely atÂ­
tended by the exhibitors of foreign countries,
notwithstanding the absence of any profesÂ­
sional character of these undertakings.
The Centennial Exhibition to beheld next
year at New Orleans In commemoration of
the centenary of the first shipment of cotton
from a port of the Unitod States bids fair to
meet with gratifying success. Under the sat
of Congress of the 10th of February, 1HK1, deÂ­
claring the exposition to be national and inÂ­
ternational In character, all foreign governÂ­
ments with which the United States maintain
relations have been invited to participate.

CIVIL SERVICE REFORM.
The Commissioners who were appointed unÂ­
der the act of January 10, 1883, entitled ""an
act to regulate and Improve the civil service
of the States."" Entered promptly upon the
dlschnrgo of these duties, a sertos of rules
framed In accordance with the spirit of statute
was approved and promulgated by the PresiÂ­
dent.In soma particular wherein they seemed deÂ­
fective these rules were subsequently amendÂ­
ed. It will be perceived that they disÂ­
countenance any polltloal or religious; tests
for admission to toe Dittoes of the publio serÂ­
vice to which the statute relates. The act Is
limited In Its original application to the
classified clerkships tn the several execuÂ­
tive departments at Washington (numbering
about &.UU0) and to similar positions in cusÂ­
toms districts and postotfioes whore ss many
as fifty persons are employed. A classificaÂ­
tion of these positions analogous to that
existing in tho Washington offices was duly
mado before the law went Into effect. Eleven
customs districts and twenty-throe postÂ­
otHoes were thus brought under the ImmediÂ­
ate operation of the statute. Tho annual
report of the Civil Service Commission, which
will .soon be submitted to Congress, will
doubtless afford the moans of mora definite
judgment than U am now prepared to exÂ­
press as to the merits of the new system. I am
persuaded that its effects have thus far
proved benefloial and Its practical methods
appear to be adequate for the ends proposed,
and there have been no serious difficulties in
carrying them into effect. Slnoo the loth of
July last no person, so far as 1 am aware, has
been appointed to the public service in the
classified portions thereof at any of the deÂ­
partments or at any of the post-offices or cusÂ­
toms districts above numed, exoept tnose cerÂ­
tified by the commission to be the most comÂ­
petent on the basis of the examinations held
In conformation of the rule.
THB PRESIDENTIAL SUCCESSION.
At the time when the present Executive enÂ­
tered his office his death, removal, resignation
or inability to discharge his duties Would have
loft the Government without a constitutional
head. It is possible, cf course, that a similar
contingency may again arise u moss tne wis
dom of Congress shall provido against
Its recurrence. The Senate at Its last
session, after full consideration, passed
an aot relating to this subject, which
will now, 1 trust, commend Itself to tho apÂ­
proval of both bouses of Congress. The olause
of the Constitution upon which must depend
any law regulating the Presidential succesÂ­
sion presents also for solution other questions
of paramount Importance. These questions
relate to the proper interpretation of the
phrase ""Inability to discharge the powers and
duties of said office."" Our organic law providÂ­
ing that, when the President Bhall suffer from
such inability, the Presidential office shall
devolve upon thn Vice President, who must
himself, under like circumstances, give place
to such officer as Congress may by law appoint
to act as President. 1 need not hore set forth
numerous and interesting Inquiries which are
suggested by these words of the constitution.
They were fully stated in my first
communication to Congress and have
since been the subject of frequent deliberaÂ­
tions in that body. It is greatly to be hoped
that these momentous questions will find
speedy solution, lest emergencies may arise
when longor delay will be impossible and any
determination, albeit the wisest may furnish
cause for anxiety and alarm.
CONCLCNION.
. Tor the reasons fully stated In my last an
nual message I repeat my recommendation
tnat congress propose an ,amenument to
that provision of the Constitution which
prescribed tho formalities for the enactment
of laws whereby, in respect to bills for tho
appropriation of publio moneys, the ExecuÂ­
tive may be enabled, while giving his
approval to particular Items, to Interpose his
veto as to such other as do not commend
themselves to his judgment. The Fourteenth
amendment of the Constitution confers the
rights of citizenship upon all persons born or
naturalized in the United States and subject
to the Jurisdiction thereof. It was the special
purpose of this amendment to Insure to memÂ­
6ors of the colored race the full enjoyment of
civil and political rights. Certain stntnatory
provisos Intended to secure the enforcement
of those rights have been reoently declared
unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, any
legislation whereby Congress may lawfully
supplement tho guarantees which the Consti
tution affords for tne equal enjoyment oi au
the citizens of the United States of every
riirht. nrlvlleire and immunity of Citizenship
will receive my unhesitating approval.

THE HIGHEST AWARD.

The Royal Bakting Powdet has the i-.
Viable recdrd of having teceived the
highest award for flftiles of its class-Â­

most perfectly combined--wieievetf 6XÂ­
hibited in competition with others. in
the exhibitions of former years, at the
Centennial, at Paris, Viennid and at the
various State and Industrial fairs,whÂ·re
it has been exhibited, judges have inÂ­
variably 'awarded the Royal Baking
Powder the highest honors.
At the recent World's Fair the exÂ­
aminations for the baking powder
awards were made by the experts of
the chemical division of the AgriculÂ­
tural Department of Washington. The
official report of the tests of the baking
powders which were made by this deÂ­
partment for the specific purpose of asÂ­
certaining which was the best, and
which has been made public, shows the
leavening strength of the Royal to be 160
cubic inches of carbonic gas per ounce
of powder. Of the cream of tartar
baking powders exhibited at the Fair,
the next highest in strength thtis tested
contained but 133 cubic inches of leaveilÂ­
ing gas. The other powders gave an
average of 111. The Royal, therefore,
was found of 20 per cent. greater leavenÂ­
ing strength than its nearest competiÂ­
tor, and 44 per cent. above the average
of all the other tests. Its superiority
in other respects, however, in the
quality of food it makes as to fineness,
delicacy and wholesomeness, could not
be measured by figures.
It is these high qualities, known and
appreciated by the women of the counÂ­
try for so many years, that have caused
the sales of the Royal Baking Powder,
as shown by statistics, to exceed the
sales of all other baking powders comÂ­
bined.

PORT ON BAKING POWDERS,
To the Publisher of the Congregationalist :





The recent publication of the report, givÂ­
ing the comparative merits of various BakÂ­
ing Powders, according to tests made by the
Government Chemists, has induced some of
the manufacturers of brands, whose inferiÂ­
ority was thus brought to light, to resort to
various means and publications, in order to
rid themselves of the results of that unfaÂ­
vorable exposition of their inferiority.
That the public may fully understand the
matter, and to avoid any misconception
arising out of the statements of our competiÂ­
tors, seeking to break the force of the report,
I herewith subjoin the main part of the
port, in which the comparative values are
correctly given.
Dr. Love's tests were made to determine
what brands are the most economical to use.
And as their capacity lies in their leavening
power, tests were directed solely to ascertain
the available gas of each powder.
It is proper to state that all the powders
examined were from the open market, and
that the original labels were in every case
broken by Dr. Love himself.

In his report, the Government Chemist
says:
* ""I regard all alum powders as very unÂ­
wholesome. Phosphate and Tartaric Acid
powders liberate their gas too freely in proÂ­
cess of baking, or under varying climatic
changes suffer deterioration.""
Dr. H. A. Mott, the former Government
Chemist, after a careful and elaborate exÂ­
amination of the various Baking Powders
of commerce, reported to the Government
in favor of the Royal brand.
An extract from the doctor's report is
given below:
"" It is not only my opinion, but a scientific
fact, that the Baking Powder known as the
ROYAL BAKING POWDER is, as is claimed,
absolutely pure, being entirely free (as deÂ­
monstrated by Chemical Analysis) from all
those inferior substitutes, such as Alum,
Terra Alba, etc., which are so extensively
used and which are all more or less injuÂ­
rious.""

"" After a month's trial of Dr. Williams' Pink Pills I was able to throw aside my crutches. But one of the most powerful effects of the pills was the restoration of functional health.

(Seo Melbourne "" Ago"" of 23rd September.) ' One of the bicycle-thieving fraternity hired a machine from Dave, and, of course, failed to return It. A few days ago Kirk, who had been keeping a strong lookout, spied his man, and without more ado made for him. His opponent, a powerfully built fellow and of much heavier weight than he, (resisted, and blood flowed freely on both sides-but the victory was Kirk's. After a severe battle, he lifted the thief up bodily, placed him in a cab, and took him to the lockup. Could greater and more convincing evidence of restored vitality be expected or given ? We venture to say not. Dr. Williams' Pink Pills restored to the sufferer the power he had lost. They cured him of his terrible injuries and sufferings, and enabled him to "" do battle"" victoriously with a bigger man than him-self. Kirk is able to trench a large garden, and daily walks two miles to his place of business, 471 Elizabeth-street North. The renowned athlete never fails to give the whole credit of his recovery to that wonder- | ful remedy discovered by Dr. Williams. The following articles, which appeared in the Melbourne papers a year ago, will Illustrate the terrible condition Dave Kirk was in after the accident : Extract from the Melbourne *' Argus"" ;"" Every one has heard of Kirk, the crack racer. About a month ago he met with an accident whilst training, and has been in the Melbourne Hospital -ever since. The I medical authorities say that he will never ride again, as his spine has been so badly hurt that he will likely be paralysed for life."" , Extract from the "" Herald"" :-"" Dave Kirk, residing at the Coffee Palace, Vic-toria-street, North Melbourne, sustained severe injuries this afternoon through fall-ing from his bicycle while training on the track at the Scotch College ground. The tire of his bicycle burst, and Kirk was thrown violently to the ground. He was removed in a cab to the Melbourne Hos-pital."" The latter extract appeared in the "" Herald"" on the afternoon of the accident, , 9th October, 1896. The former appeared in the "" Arghs"" about a month later, after the physicians and authorities had placed him under treatment, and discovered that his Injuries had resulted in paralysis, spinal disease, and locomotor ataxia, and that he was entirely beyond their aid. His case was accordingly, by the physicians Who ex-amined him, pronounced incurable, and they told poor Kirk that he would never rise from his bed again. Dr. Williams' Pink Pills have a remark-able efficacy in curing diseases arising from an impoverished condition of the blood or an Impairment of the nervous system, such as rheumatism, neuralgia, partial paralysis, locomotor ataxia, nervous headache, nervous prostration, and the tired feeling arising therefrom. They are genuine only with the full name, Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People, and are sold in boxes encircling which is a blue warning label.

The geuerrl character of the convention
already signed by the delegates of more
than tweoty sovereign stlers further
commends It to the faIvorable action of
the senate of the Unitedl States, whoso
ratification It still awaits.
Slnce my last annual message, and
In obedience to the acts of congress of
Aprll 220a d 20, 0188 the remralong
volunteer force enlisted for the SpanÂ­
ish war, consisting of 34.834 regulars
and 110).202 volunteers, with over 5000
vothrteer officers, have been discharged
from the military service. Of the volunÂ­
teer. 0i0 ofilCers innd 14,831 rmen were
servlig In the Phllipplnes, and 1050 of
the regalars, lwho were entitled to be
mustered out alter the ratification of the
treaty of peace. They voluntarily reÂ­
inarled at the front until their places
could be filled by new troops.
They were returned home In the order
In wihich they went to Manila, and
are now, all of them, out of the service
and In the ranks of citizenship. I
recommend that the congress provides a
special medal of honor for the volunteers,
regulars, sailors and marines on duty In
the Philipplines, who voluntarily remained
in the service after their terms of enÂ­
lintament had expired.
By the act of Starch 2, 1890, congress
gave authority to Increase the regular
army to a maximum not exceeding 65,Â­
000 enlisted men, and to enlist a force
of 35,000 volunteers recruited from the
country at large. By virtue of this auÂ­
thority the
REGULAR ARMY HAS BEEN INÂ­
CREASED
to the number of 01,99000 enlisted men
and 2248 officers, and new volunteer
regiments have been organized, aggreÂ­
gating 83,050 enlisted men and 1524 ofÂ­
ficeers. Two of these volurteer regiments
are made up of colored men, with colÂ­
ored line officers. The new troops to
take the place of those returning from
the Philippines have been transported to
Manila to the number of 581 officers
and 20,322 enlisted men of the regular
army, and 0594 officers and 15,388 enlisted
men of the new volunteer force,
while 504 officers and 14,110 men
of the volunteer force are on the ocean
en route to Manila.
The force now In Manila consists of
005 officers and 30.578 regulars, and 5904
officers and 15,388 of the volunteers,
making an aggregate of 149900 officers and
45,000 men. When the troops now unÂ­
der orders shall reach Manila the force
In the archipelago will comprise 2051
officers and 3,45da men.
The muster out of thie great volunteer
army organlzed for the Spanish war,
and' the creation of a new army, the
trarsportntlon from Manila to San FranÂ­
clso of those entitled to discharge nnd
the transportation of the new troops
to other places has beeh a work of
great magnitude, well nd ably done.
for which too murch credit cannot be
given the war department.
During the past year we have reduced
our force In Cuba and Puerto Rico. In
Crta swe now have 331 officers and 10.Â­
yo9J enlisted men: In Puerto Rico, 87
officers and 2855 enlisted men and a batÂ­
talion of 40D men, composed of native
Prerto Rlcans, while stationed throughÂ­
out the United States are 001 officers
and 17,371 men, and In Hawaii 12 ofÂ­
ficers and 453 enlisted men.
The operations of the army are fully
presented In the report of the secreÂ­
tary of war. I cannot withhold from
officers and men the highest commnendaÂ­
tlon for their soldierly conduct in tryÂ­
Ing sltuatlon-., their willing snaclfnces
for their country, and the integrity and
ability with which they have performed
unusual and difficult duties In our Island
possessions.
In the organization of the volunteer
regiments, authorized by the act of
iMarch 2, 1899. It was found that no
provision had been made for chaplains.
This omission was doubtless from InadÂ­
vertence. I recommend the early authorÂ­

lain for each of the said regiments.

forces of occupation anl for tihe :at:lve
population 'to meet these reqaliremenrs
has Involved substanutlnia reconstruction.
The exlst!ng systems were so fragmentÂ­
ary, defective and inadequate that a
new and comaprehreslve organizatton had
to he created. American trained offiÂ­
cials have been asosfned to tihe directing
anl executive poaltions, while natirves
have been chietly employed In making
up the body of the force. In working
out this plan the merit rtule ha been
rigorously and faithfully iapplied.
The appointment of director general
of posts of Cuba was given to an exÂ­
pert who had been chief post office InÂ­
spector and assistant postmaster genÂ­
eral, and who unltctl large experlence
whith administrative capacity. Bor the
postmastership at HIavana the range of
skilled and available men was scanned
and the choice fell uipon one who had
been twenty years In the srrvice as
deputy postmaster and postmaster of a
large city. This principal governed and
determined the selection of American ofÂ­
foers sent not only to Cuba but to
Puerto Rico, and they were instructed
to apply it so far as practical In the
employment of natives as minor postÂ­
masters and clerks. The postal system
in Cuba, though remaining under the
general guidance of the postmaster genÂ­
eral, was made esseutially independent
It was felt that It should not be a
burden upon the postal service of the
United States, and provision was made
that any deticit In the postal revenue
should be a charge upon the generale
revenues of the Island. Though Puerto
Rico and the Philippines had a different
relation to the United States, yet for
convenience of administratlon the same
principle of tn autonomous nystem has
been extended to them.
Tihe development of the service In ail
of the istlands has e-n rapid and nucÂ­
eteful. It has moved forward on AmerÂ­
Iran lines with free deilvery money orÂ­
der and registry systems atnd hits given
the people mail facilities far greater and
more reliable than any they have beÂ­
ftre onloyed. It is thin not only a
vital agency of industrial social and
b:slness pronress, but an muportaht InÂ­
fluence In diffusing a Just understanding
rif the true spirit and character of AmerÂ­
Ican adminlstratlon..
TIHE DOMESTIC POSTAL SERVICE
continues to grow with extraordlinary
rapidity. The expenditures and the revÂ­
enues will each exceed $100,000,000 durÂ­
ing the current year. Fortunately since
the revival of prosperous times, the revÂ­
enuea have grown much faster than the
expenditures and there Is every indicaÂ­
tlon that n short period will witness
the obliteration of the annual deflcit. In

e.nn roll of the United States numbered
f''1,019. These Iclude the pensloneta
of the army and navy In all our wars.
Ihe number added to tlhe roll during
the year was 40,991. The number dropped
by reason of death, re-marriage, minors
by legal llnltnttou. fallure to claim
within three years and other causes, was
4.3,186, and the number of claims 00sÂ­
allowed was 107,019. During the year
89,0110 penasiou certificates were IsaÂ­
sued, of which 37,077 were for new or
original pensions. The amount disbursed
for army and navy pensions during the
year was $130,355,0o2 95, which was 91,Â­
6151,461 1 leass tlian the sum of the upÂ­
proprtationo. PThe
Grand Army of the Itepublic, at
its recent national encampment, held at
Phlladelphia, has brought to my attenÂ­
lion and to that of the congress, the
wisdom and Joustice of a modifieatlon of
the third section of the act of June 21,
1810, which provides pensions for the
widows of officers and enlisted men who
served ninety clays or more during the
war of the rebellion and were honorÂ­
ably discharged, provided that such
widows are without other means of supÂ­
port than their daily labor and were
married to the soldier, sailor or marine,
on account of whose service they claim
pension, prior to the date of the act.
The preaent holding of the department
Is that if the widow a income aside from
her daily labor does not exceed in amount
what her penson would be, to-wit: 96
per annum, she would be deemed to be
without other means of support than
her dally labor and would be entitled
to a pension under this act while if the
widow's inccme IndependentÂ­ of the
amount received by her as thin 'result
of her daily labor exceed $16 per annum,
she would not be pensionable under the
act. I am advised by the commissioner
of pensions that the amount of income
allowed before title to pension would be
barred has varied widely under different
ADMINISTRATIONS OF TIIE PENÂ­
SION OFFICE,
as well as during different periods of
the same administration, and has been
the cause of just complaint and criticism.
With the approval of the secretary of
the interlor tie commissioner of penÂ­
sone recommends that In order to make
practIce at all times uniform and to do
justice to the dependent widow, the
amount-of income allowed; independent
of the proceeds of her daily labor, should
be not lea than $250 per annum, and
he urges that the congress shall so
amend the act as to permit the pension
office to grant pensionable value to
widows under the terms of the third
section of the act of June 27, 1890, whose
Income, aside from the proceeds of daily
labor, is not In excess of $250 per anÂ­
num. 1 believe this to be a simple act
of Justice and heartily recommend It.
The Dawes commission reports that
granfying progress has been made in
its work durling the preceding year. The
field work of enrollment of four of the
nations has been completed. I recomÂ­

tional purposes In the Indian Territory.
In acordauce with the act of congress
aproved March 3, 1899, the preliminary
work In connection with the twelftt
census is now fully under way. The
olicers required for the proper adminÂ­
istration of the duties imposed have
been selected. The provlsrion for seÂ­
curing a proper enumeion of the
population as well as to secure evidence
of the Industrial growth of the nation,
is broader and more comprehensive than
any similar legislation in the past. The
director advises the levy needful is
being made to push the good work to
completlon In the time limited by the
statute. It is believed thatbthe twelfth
census will emphasize our remarkable
advance In all that pertains to national
progress.
Under the authority of the act of conÂ­
gress approved July 7, 18a8, the commisÂ­
sion, consisting of the secretary of the
treasury, the attorney general nnd the
secretry of the interior, has made an
agreement of settlement, which had my
approval, of the indebtedness to the govÂ­
ernment growing out of the issue of
bonds to aid in the construction of the
Central Pacific and Western Pacific RailÂ­
roads. The agreement secures to the
government the principal and interest of
soid bonds, amounting to $58,812,715 48.
There has been paid thereon $11,762,Â­
143 12, which has been covered Into the
treasury, and the remainder, payable
within ten years, with interest at the
rate of 3 per cent per annum, payable
semi-annually, is secured by the deposit
of an equal amount of first mortgage
honds of the Pacific railway companies.
The amounts paid and secured to be
paild to the government on 4ccount of the
PACIFIC RAILROAD SUBSIDY
claims are: Union Pacific, cash, $58,448,Â­
223 74; Kansas Pacific, cash, $6,301,000;
Central Pacific and Western Pacific, cash,
$11,798,814 14. Notes, secured, $47,050,Â­
172 30. Kansas Pacific dividends for deÂ­
ficiency, due United States cash, $821,Â­
8197 70, making a total of $124,421,607 95.
Tihe whole indebtedness was about
$130,000,000, more than half of which
consisted of accrued interest, for which
sum the government has realized the enÂ­
tire amount, less about $6,000,000. within
a period of two years.
On June 30, 1899, there were thirty
forest reservations (exclusive of the
Afognak forest and fish culture reservaÂ­
sion in Alaska), embracing an estimated
area of 40,710,474 acres. During the
past year two of the existing forest reÂ­
serves, the Tracubo canyon (Californla)
and Bilack Hills (South Dakota and WyoÂ­
ming) have been considerably enlarged;
the area of the Mount Runler reserve, In
the state of Washington, has been someÂ­
what reduced, and six additional reÂ­
serves have been established.

mated area of which Is 5,205,775 acres.
This makes, at the present time, a toÂ­
nal-of thirty-six forest reservations, emÂ­
bracing an estimated area of 40,021,899
acres. This estlmated area is the aggreÂ­
gated areas within the boundaries of the
reserves. The lands actually reserved are, howÂ­
ever, only the vacant public lands there.
In. and these have been set aside and reÂ­
served for sale or settlement, In order
that they may be of the greatest use
to the people.
FIOTECTION
O TUEB NATIONAL
FORESTS,
inaugurated by the department of the InÂ­
terior in 1817, has been continued during
the past year, and much has been neÂ­
complished in lth way of preventing
forest fires and the protection of the tlimÂ­
iter. There are now large tracts covered
by forests which will eveattsly be rn
served and set apart for forest uses. UnÂ­
tll that can be done, congreas should InÂ­
crease the nppropirlitions for the work
of protecting the forests. The departÂ­

dulcted in the search for varieties adaptÂ­
ed to the exacting conditions. The InÂ­
troduction of tea gardens In the southern
states promises to provide employmeat
for idle hands, as well as to supply the
home market with tea. The subject of
Irrigation, where it Is of vital importance
to the people, is being carefully studied.

On the 10th of December, 1898, the
treaty of peace between the United
States and Spain was signed. It proÂ­
vided, among other things, that Spain
should cede to the United States the
archlpelago known as
THU PHILIPPINE ISLANDS;
that the United States should pay to
Spain the sum of $20,000,000, and that
tie civil rights and political status of
the native inhabitants of the territories
thus ceded to the United States shouldÂ­
be determined by the congress.
The treaty was ratified by the senate
on the 6th of IFebruary, 1809L, and by the
government of Spain on the iLth of
anrch following. The rarttiicatons were
exchanged on tae 11th of April, and the
treaty publicly proclaimed. On .-the 2d
of -March congress voted the sum conÂ­
templated by the treaty, and the amount
wea paid over to the Spanish governÂ­
ment on.the let of May. In this manner
the Philipplnes came to the United
-Sutts. The islands were ceded by the
government of Spaln, which bad been
in undisputed posseslon of them for
reutorie. They were accepted, not
merely by our authorized agents In Paris,
under the direction of'the executive but
by the constitutionaland well considered
action of the representatilves of the
people in, both houses of congresas. I
had every reason to believe and I still
believe, that this transfer o> sovereignty
was in accordance with the wishes and
the aspiratlons of the great mass of the
Filipino people.
From the earliest moment, no opporÂ­
tunity was lost. of assuring the people
of the islands of our ardent desire for
their welfare, and of the intention ofÂ­
this government to do everything posÂ­
sible to advance their interests. in. my
order of the 10th of May, 1898, the
commaonder of the military expedition
dispatched to the Phidppine was In.
strutted to declare that we came not to
make war upon the people of that
cuntry, nor upon any party or faction
among them; but to protect them in their
homes,--in their employments and In their
persoual'and religious rights; that there
should be no doubt as to the paramount
authority there, on the 17th of August
It was directed that there must be no
joint occupation with the Insurgents;
that the United States must preserve
the peace and protect persons and
property within the terrltory occupied
with their military and naval forces;
that the insurgents and all others must
recognize the military occnpation and
authority of the United States.
As early as Dec. 24. before the cession
and In anticipation of that event, the
commander in Manila was urged to
restore peace and tranqnlility and to
undertake the establishment of a benefiÂ­
cent government which should afford the
fullest security for life and property.
On the 21st of December, after the
treaty was signed, the commander of
the forces of occupation was instructed
""to announce and proclaim in the most
public manner that we came,
NOT AS INVAIDERS AND CONQUIERÂ­
ORS., BUT AS FRIONDS,
to protect the natives In their homes,
In their employments and in their perÂ­
sonal and religious rights.""
On the same day. while ordering Gen-.
eral Otls to acsee that the peace should
be preserved In Ilolio. he was admonished
that ""It Is most important that there
should be no conflict with the .insurÂ­
gents."" On the let vday of January,
1899, urgent orders were reiterated that
the kindly intentions of this government
should be in every possible way comÂ­
municated to the insurgents. On the
21st of January, I announced my intention
of dlspatchblng to Manila a commission
composed of three gentlemen of the
highest character and distinction, thorÂ­
oughly acquainted with the orient, who,
In association with Admiral Dewey and
Major General Otis, were instructed to
""facilitate the most humane and effective
extension of authority throughout the
islands, and to secure with the least
possible delay the benefits of a wise and
generous protection of life and propertÂ­
to the inhabitanta."" .
These gentlemen were Dr. Jacob CI
Schurman, president of Cornell Unlv
ityl; Hon. Charles Denby, for mas
years minister to China, and Prof. Den.
Worcester, of the University of MlchiÂ­
gan, who had made a most careful study
of life In the Philippines. While the
treaty of 'eace was under consideration
in the senate, these commissioners net
out on their mission of good will and.
ibarat'lon. Their character was suffiÂ­
cient guarantee of the beneficent purpose
with which they went, even if they had
not borne the positive instructions' of
this government. which made their
errand pre-eminently one of peace and
frlendhahl.
But before their arrival at Manila the
sinister ambition of a few leaderla of
the Filipinos had created a situation full
of embarrassment for the United States
and most grievlousa in its consequences
to themselves. The clear and impartial
preliminary report of the commassiloners,
which I transmit herewith gives so uucid
and comprehensive a history of the
present insurrectionary movement that
the story need not be here repeated. It
is enough to say that the claim of the
rebel leader, that he was promised inÂ­
dependence by an officer of the United
States In return for his assistance, has
no foundation in fact, and it is categoriÂ­
rally denied by the very witnesses who
were called to prove it, The most the
insurgent leader hoped for when he
came to Manila wan the liberation of the
islande from the Spanish control, which
they had been laboring for years without
success to throw off.
The prompt accomplishment of this
work by the American army and navy
--ve him otLer Ideas and ambltion., and
dua suggestions from various quarÂ­
ters perverted the purposes and hatenÂ­
lons with which he had taken up arms.
No sooner had our army captured
Manila than the Plllpino forces began to
assume
AN ATTITUDE OF SUSPICION ANIR
HOSTILITY
which the utmost efforts of our fficern
and troops were unable to disarm or
modify. Their kindness and forbearance
were taken as a proof of cowardice, The
aggressions of the Filipinos continually
increased until finally, just before the
time set by the senate of the United
States for a vote upnoon the treaty an.
cattack, evidently prepared In advance,
was made all along tao American lines,
which resulted in a terribly, desirnctlve
and sanguinary repulse of the insurgents.
Ten days later an order of the insurgent
government wa nissued to its adherents
who had remained In Manila, of which
General Otis Justly observes that ""for
barbarous intent Is unequaled In modern
times."" It directs that at 8 o'clock on
the night of Feb. 15. the territorial.
militta shall come together in the gtreetr
of loan Pedro. armed with their bolos,
wlth guns and ammunition, where conÂ­
venlent, that Fillpino famtlies only she'll
be respected, hut that all other IndlÂ­
vhluals, of whatever race they may he,
nhall be exterminated without any comÂ­
passion, after the exbermination of the
army of occupation. and adds:
""roLthers, we must avenge ourselves
of the Americans. and exterminate, that
we may take our revenge for the
infamies and treacheries which they
have committed roan us. Have no
compassion upon them; attack them with
vigor.""
A copy of this fell, by good fortune,
Into the hbnds of oar olfiers, and they
were able to take measures to control
the rising, w~hich wan actually attempted


than woo originally contem~plated. A
considerable number of armed nsorgents
entered the city by waterways and
swamps, and, in concet with confedÂ­
erates inslae, attempted to destroy
Manlla by tire. They were kept In chelek
during the night, and the next day
driven out of the city with heavy lose.
'This was 'the unhappy condition of affairs
which confronted our commissiloners on
their arrival In Manila. They had come
with the hope and Intention of coÂ­
operatlon with Admiral Dewey and
Major General Otis in establiashlng peace
and order in the archipelago, and the
largest measure of self-government comÂ­
patible with the true welfare of the
eole. What they actually found can
be tbeat set forth In their own words:
""Deplorable as war Is, the one in which
we are now engaged wan unavoidable
hby usno. VWe were attacked by a hold,
adventurous and enthusiastie army. No
alterna'tlve was left to us except Ignom.
inous retreat.
""It Is not to be conceived that any
American would have esanctioned the
surrender of Manla to the Insurgenats.
Our obllgaOtioa to other nations and to
the frielndly F'llllnou and to ourselves
and our flag, demanded that force ahould





be met-by foree. Whatever the future
of the Philippines may be, there is no'
course open to us now except
THrE PROSECUTION OF TIE WAit
untll the Insurgents are reduced to sobÂ­
mission. The commisosion is of tile opinÂ­
ion that there has been no time since
the destruction of the Spanish squadron
by Admiral Dewey whenit was possihle
to withdraw our forces from the Islals,.
either with honor to ourselves or with
safety to the inhabltanuts.""
The coturse thus clearly indicated has
been unflinchingly pursued. The rebelliot
must be put down. Civil government canÂ­
mot be thoroun-hly established until order
is restored. WVrh a devotlion and galÂ­
lantry worthy of its most brilliant 'lsÂ­
tory, the army, able and loyally assisted
by the navy. has carried on this unwelÂ­
come but most righteous campaign with
richly-deserved success. The noble selfÂ­
anacrlifee with which our soldiers and
sailors, whose terms of service had 'exÂ­
pired; iefnsed to avail themselves of their
right to return home as long as they were
needed at the front. farns one of the
brightest pages In our annals. Although
their operatlone have -been somewhat InÂ­
terrupted and checked by a rainy season
of unusual violence and duration, they
hnve gained ground steadily in every dlÂ­
rectlon. and now look forward conlidenltly
to the speedy completlon of their task.
The unfavorable circumstances connected
with an active campaign have not been
ermiltted to Interfere with the equally
Important work of reconstruction. Again'
I invite your attention to the report of
the commlssooners for the Interesting and
encouraging details of the work atready
accomplished In the 'etabhlshament of
peace and order and the inauguratlon
of self-governing mtnidcipa life in many
portions of the archipelago. A notable
boeginning has been made In the establishÂ­
ment of a government In the island of
Negros, which is deservlng of especial
conslderation. This was the first iland
to accept American sovereignty. Its peoÂ­
ple unreservedly proclalmed alleglance to
the United States and adopted a conÂ­
stltutlon looking to the establishment of
a popular government. It was Impossible
to guarantee to the people of the island
of Negr.e that the constitutton so adopted
should be the ultimate form of governÂ­
ment. Such a question, under the treaty
of Spain and In accordance with our cotÂ­
atltution and laws comes exclusively
within the Jurlsdlction of congroess. The
government actually set up by the inÂ­
hbabltans of Negros evetnally proved
unsatisfactory to the natives themselves.
A new system was put In force iW order
of the major general commanding 'the deÂ­
partment,. of which the following are the
most important elements:
,It was ordered that

order of the commanding general.
The time and places of holding elections
are to be fixed by the military governor
of the island of Negros. The qualifcaÂ­

the succession of ithe United States to tjhe
rights of Spain,' and our flag floats over
that terriltory. On the 10th of August,
809, Blrigadier General J. C. Bates,
U. S. V., negotiated an agreement with
the sultan and his principal chiefn, whlch
1 transmit herewith. By article 1, the
sovereignty of the United States over the
whole archipelago of Jolo and Ite""BepenÂ­
dencles Is declared and acknowledged.
The United States flag will be used In
the archipelago and its dependencies, on
land and so. Piracy is to be suppressed,
and the sultan agreeos to co-operate heartiÂ­
ly with the United States authorities to
Shat end and to make every possible ef
fort to arrest and to bring to Justice ail
persons engaged In piracy. All trade in
domestic products of the archipelago of
Jolo, when carried on with any mart of
the Philippine islands and under the
American flag, shall be free, unllmited
and undutiabie. The United States win
give full protection to the sultan In case
any foreign nation should attempt to ImÂ­
posne upon him. The United States will
not sell the island of Jolo or any other
Island of the Jolo archipeolgo 'to any forÂ­
elan nation. without the consent of the
eultan. 'Salaries for the sultan and his
aunoclates In the administration of the
ellanda hate been aureed upon to the
amount of $7610 monthly.
Article 10 provides that any slave In the
archlpelago shall have the right to purÂ­
chane freedom by paying to the master
to the usual market value, The agreeÂ­
ment by General Bates ""ras made subject
to sontirmatlie of the president and ouÂ­
Cure modifications by the ronsent of the
parties in Interest. I 'havoe confirmed said
agreement, subJect to the action of the
con.gress, and with Eta reservaton, which

to the su'Msn of Jolo, that this agreement
is not to be deemed In any iray to ane or

our traditions, a great opportunity comes
with them. The islands lie under the
shelter of our fag, They are ours by
every title of law and equity. They can
not be abandoned. It we desert them
we leave them at once to anarchy anl
linally to harbarlsm. We fling them, a
golden apple of discord, among the rival
powers, no one of h'hich could permit
another to seize them umlnuestloned.
Their rich plains and valleys would be
the scene of endless strife anl bloodÂ­
shed. The advent of Dewey's fleet in
Mtanila lny instead of being, as we hope
the dawn of a new day of freedom and
progress, will have been the beginning
of an era of misery and violence worse
than any which has darkened their unÂ­
happy past. 'The suggestion hbas been
made that we could renounce our authorÂ­
ity over the tslands and giving them IndeÂ­
pendence, could retain a protectorate over
them. This proposition will not be
found, I am sure, worthy of yTour serious
attention. Such an arrangement would
Involve at the outset a cruel breach of

It would make us responpsille for the acts
of the Insurgent leader and lgive us no
power to control them. It wotld charge
us with the tansk of protecting them
against eadh other and defending them
against any forelign power with which
they chose to quarrel. In short, It
would take from the congress of the
United States the power of declarlng
war and vest that tremendous prerogaÂ­
tire in the Tagalo lender of the hour.
It does not seem desirable thlot I
should recommend at this time a specific
and finl form of government for these
Islands. When peace shall be restored,
it will be the duty of congress to conÂ­
struct a plan of government which shall
establish and maintain freedom and or;
der and peace In the Philippines. The
insurrection is still existing and when it
terminates further information will be
required as to the actual condition of neÂ­
fairs before inaugurating a permanent
scheme of elvll government. The full
report of the commission, now In prepÂ­
aratlon, will contain Information and
suggestions which will be of value to
congress, and which I will troansmlt as
soon as it Is completed. As long as the
insurrection contllnes the military arm
must necessarily be supreme; but there
is no reason why steps should not be
taken from time to time to inaugurate
governments essentially popular In their
form as fast as territory Is held or. con.
trolled byÂ­ our troops. To this end. I
am consIdering the advisability of the
return of the commission, or such memÂ­
hers thereof as can be secured to aid
the existing authorities and facilitate
this work throughout the islands. I
have believed that reconstructlon should
not begin by the establlshlment of
ONE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT FOt
THE ISLANDS,
with its seat at Manila, but rather that
the work should be commenced by bulld.
lag up from the bottom, first establlshÂ­
Ing municipal governments and then proÂ­
vincial governments a central governÂ­
ment at last to follow.
Until congress,shall have made known
the formal expression of its will, I shall
use the authority vested In me by the
constItution and the statutes to uphold
theÂ­ sovereignty of the United States in
those distant tslands, as In all other
places where our flag rightfully floats. I
shall put at the disposal of the army and
navy all the means which the liberality
of congress and the people have proÂ­
vided to cause this unprovoked and
wasteful Insurrection to cedase. If any
orders of mine were required to Insure
the merciful conduct of military and an.
val operations they wouldl not be lackÂ­
ing, but every step of the progress of our
troops has been marked b a humanity
which has surprised even the misguided
insurgents. The truest kindness to
them will be a swift and effective.defeat
of their present lender. The hour of
victory will be the hour of clemency and
reconstruction. No effort will be spared
to build up the waste places desolated by
war and long years of misgovernment.
We shall not wait for the end of strife
to begin the beneficent work. We shall
continue, as we have begun, to open the
achools and the churches, to set the
courts In operation, to foster Industry
and trade and agriculture and in every
way in our power to make these people
whom Providence has brought within our
jurledlctlon feel that It Is their liberty
and not our power, their welfare and not
our gain, we are seeking to enhance.
Our duag has never waved over any com.
munity but in blessing. I believe the
Fllplhoos will soon recognize the fact
ihat It has not lost its gift of benedicÂ­
tion In this world-wide journey to their.
shores. Some embarrdssment In admln.
Istrotlion has occurred by reason of the
ecullar status which the Hawaiian IsÂ­
and at present occupy under the joint.
resolution of annexation approved July
7, 1898. While by that resolution the
republic of Hawaii as an independent
nation, was extlnguished, its sovereignty
destroyed and Its property and possesÂ­
sions vested In the United States, yet a
complete establishment of Its government
under our system was not effected. While
the municipal laws of the Islands not
enacted for the fulfillment of treaties
and not inconsistent with the joint resÂ­
lutlon or contrary to the constitution of
the United States or any of Its treaties
remain In force, yet these laws relate
only to the socital and Internal affairs of
the Islands and do not touch many sub.Â­
jects of importance which are of a broader
national character, For example,
THE HAWAIIAN REPUBLIC
eas divested of alil title to the public
lands in the islands and is not only un.
able to dispose of lands to settlers deÂ­
slrting to take up homestead sites, but
1 wtlhaout power to clue complete tiile
In cases where lands have been entered
upon lease or other conditions which
carry with them the right to the purÂ­
chaser, or settler, to have a full title
granted to him upon compliance with the
conditions prescribend by law or by his
particular agreement of entry.
Questions of doubt and difficuliy Isare
also arisen with reference to the collecÂ­
tion of tonnage taxes on vessels roming
from Hawaiian ports; with reference to
the statues of Chlnese in the islands, their
entrance and exit therefrom, as to patÂ­
ents and to copyrights, as to the register
of vessels under the navigation laws, as
to the necessity for holding elections in
accordance with the provisions of the
Hawaiian statutes for the' choice of vearÂ­
ousn oficers, and as to several other mat
ters of detail touching the interests, both
of the island and of the government. By
the resolution of annexation, the presiÂ­
dent was directed to appoint five comÂ­
missioners to recommend to congress
such

as they should deem necessary or propÂ­
er. The commissioners were duly ap.
pointed, and, after a careful InvestlgaÂ­
lion and study of the system of laws and
government prevai.Ing In the islands and
of the conditions existing there, they
prepared a bhll to provide a government,
under the title of the ""Territory of Ha
waill"" The report of the commission,
with the bill which they prepared, was
.transmitted to congress on Dec . 1898,
but the bill still awaits final action.
The people of these islands are entiÂ­
tled to the benefits and privileges of our
constitutlon, but In the absence of any
act of congress providing for federal
courts In the Islands and for a procedure
by which appeals, writs of error and other
judicial proceedlnes necessary for the en.
Sorcement ot civil rights may be prose.
culed, they are powerless to secure their
enforcement bny .the judgment of the
courts of the Unlted States. It Is manlÂ­
festly important, therefore, that an act
sahll be passed as speedily as posslile
erecting these Islands Into a jud clal dIsÂ­
trlct, providing for the appointment of
a Judge and other proper oficers and
m-ethods of procedure in appellate proÂ­
ceedings, and tbat the government of this
newly acquired territory under the feder,
al constitution shall be filly defined and
provided for.
A necessity for immediate legislative
relief exists in the_terrltoryoef Alaska,


ouostantla.iy the only law provtaiog a
civil government for this territory is the
act of May T17, 1884. Thils Is meager In
Its provisions. and Is fitted only for the
adminlsistratlon of affairs In a conntry
sparsely Inhabited by civilized people,
and onimportant In trade and production
as was Alaska at the time this act was
aSord. The lncrenae in population by
immigration during the past few years,
consequent opon the discovery of gold,
has produced such a condition as calls
for more ample farllltles for local aelfÂ­
government. and more numerous eonven.
iees oft civil and Judicial administraÂ­
tion. Settlements have grown up In
varloos places constituting, in point of
populaotlon and business, cities of thous.
ends of Inhabitantsi yet there is no proviÂ­
sion of lnw nunder which a municipality
can he organized or maintained. In some
locnltles the Inhabitants have met toÂ­
gether and voluntnri:y formed a moulcipal
organlization for the purpose of local govÂ­
ernment, adopting the form of a muni.
clpal constitution and charter under
which paid offclals have been appointed,
and ordinances creating and. regulating a
police force, a fire department a departÂ­
ment of health, and maklng provisions
for the care of the insane and iIngient
~oor and sick, and for public schools have
been ae l hese Proceldins and the]

 ordinances passed by such munlclpalities
are without statutory authorilty, and
have no sanction, except as they are
maintained by the popular sentiment of
the commnunity. There is an entlre at.
Hunce of authority to provide the ordiÂ­
nary instruments of local pollee control
and administration, the population con.
slisting of the usual percentage of lawÂ­
less adventurers of the class that ahwa y
flock to new fields of enterprise or dlsÂ­
covery, under circumstances which reÂ­
quire more than ordinary provision for

TIIE WHOLE VA-ST AREA 0F1
ALASKA
comprises but one Judicial district, with
one Judge, one marshal, and one district
attorney, yet the civil and criminal buslÂ­
ness has more than doubled withinu the
past year, and is many times greater,
bOth in volume and hImportanuce, than It
was In 1884. The dutled of the Judage reÂ­
quire him to travel thousands of miles to
dlehargeo his Judicial duties at the various
places uealgnatod for that purpose. The
territory ohould be divided into at least
two districts, and an additional judge,
district attorney, marshal. and other apÂ­
pointilve officers be provided. 'lnere Is
practically no organized form of governÂ­
ment in the territory. There is no auÂ­
thorlty except in congress to pass any
law, no matter how local or trivial, and
the dltlnculty of conveying to the conÂ­
gress an adequate coneeptlon and underÂ­
standing of the various needs of the peoÂ­
pie in the different communities is easlly
anderstood. I see no renson why a
more complete form of territorial 6rgani.
zatlon should not be provided. Following
the precedent established in the year 180i,
when a temporary government was proÂ­
vided for the recently acquired territory
then known under the name of Loulsl.
ann, it seems to me that It would be ad.
vantageous to confer greater execotive
power upon the governor and to establish,
as was done in the case of the territory
of Louisiana, a legis.ative conncil, hav.
Ing power to adopt ordinances which shall
extend to all the rigatful subjects-of the
local legislation, such ordinances not to
take effect until reported to and apÂ­
proved-by the congress, it in session, and
if that body Is not in session, then by
the president. In this manner a system
of laws providing for the Incorporation
and government of towns and cities hoeÂ­
ing a certain populatiot, giving them the
power to establish and maintain a sysÂ­
tem of education to be locally supported,
and an ordinance providing for police
sanitary and other such purposes, could
be speedily provided. I believe a pro.
vIllon of thls kind would be satisfacÂ­
tory to the people of the territory. It
Is probable that the area Is.too vast and
the population too scattered and translÂ­
tory to make It wise at present to provide
for an elective legislative body, but the
conditions aUling for local selfeovern.
ment will undoubtedly very soon exist,
and will be facilitated by the measures
which I have recommended. I recomÂ­
mend that legislatilon to the same end
be had with reference to
THE GOVERNMENT OF PUItETO
1I0.0.
The time Is ripe for the adoption of a
temporary form of government for this
island, and many suggestions made with
reference to Alaska are applicable to
Puerto Rico.
The system of civil jurisprudence now
adopted by the people of this island is
described by competent lawyers, who are
familiar with It, as thoroughly modern
and scientific, so far as it relates to matÂ­
ters of internal business, trade, prodÂ­
uction, and social and private rights in
general.
The cltles. of the island are governed
by charters, which probably require very
little or no change. So that with relaÂ­
uion to matters of local concern and priÂ­
vate right, it Is not probable that much,
If any. legislation Is desirable; but with
reference to public administration and
the relation of the islands to the federal
government, there are many matters
which are of 'pressing urgency. The
same necessity exilsts for legislation on
the part of congress to establish federal
courts and federal jurisprudence In the
island, as ihas been previously pointed
out by me with reference to Hawaii. Be.
sides the administration of Justice, there
are the subjects of the public lands;
the control of rivers and harbors;u the
control of the waters or streams not
navigable, which, under the Spanish law,
belonged to the crown of Spain, and have,
bn the treaty of cession, passed to the
United tates; the immigration of people
from foreign countries; the Importation
-of contract labor; the imposition and colÂ­
lection of internal revenue; the applicaÂ­
tion of the navigation laws; the reguÂ­
lation of the current money; the estab.
lishment of post offies and post roads;
the regulation of tariff rates on merchanÂ­
dise Imported from the Island Into the
United States; the establishment of ports
or entry and delivery; the regnulatlion of
patents and copyrights there, with vartÂ­
oils other subjects, which rest entirely
within the power of congress, call for
cohsideratioa and Immediate action.
It must be borne in mind that since
the cession Pnerto Rico has been denied
the principal market she had long enÂ­
joyed, and our efforts have been continÂ­
ned against her products as when she
was under Spanish sovereignty. bhe
markets of Spain are closed to her prodÂ­
uets, except upon terms to which comÂ­
merce of all nations Is subjected. The
Island of Couba, which used to buy her
cattle and tobacco without customs duÂ­
ties, now Imposes the same duties upon
these products as from any other conn.
try entering her ports. She has, thereÂ­
fore, lost her free Intercourse with Spa!n
and Cuba without any compensating benÂ­
efits in this market. Her coffee was litÂ­
tle knowd and not In nuse by onr people,
and thereiore there was no demand here
for this, one of her chief products. The
markets of the United States should be
opened to her products.
Our plain duty is to abolish all cusÂ­
toms tariffs between the United States
and Puerto Rico, and give her products
free access to our markets. -
As a result of the
HURRICANE WHICIIH SWEPT OVER
PUERTO RICO,
on the 8th of August, over 100,000 peoÂ­
ple were reduced to absolute destituÂ­
tion, wlthout homes and deprived of the
necessities of life. To the appeal of the
war department the people of the United
States made prompt and generous reÂ­
sponse. In addition to the prlvate charity
of our people, the war department has
expended for the relief of distressed
$3'2,342, which does not Include the cost
of transportation.
It is desirable that the government of
the island, under the law of belligerent
rights, now maintained through the exÂ­
ecutive department, should be supersedÂ­
ed by an administration entirely civil
in Its natnre. For the present purpose
I recommend that congress pass a law
for the organization of-a temporary govÂ­
ernment which shall provide for the app
pointtment by the president, subject to
confirmntion by the senate, of a goverÂ­
nor and such other officers as the genÂ­
eral administration of the island may
require; and for legislative purposes, on
subjects of a local nature not partahÂ­
tog of a federal character, a legslative
council, tompomed partly of Puerto ElÂ­
cans and party of cltizens of the United
States, shall he named and appointed
y the president, subject to eonfrmsÂ­
ion by the senate, their ncts toO be
subject to the approvoi of congress or
the presldent, prior to going into efÂ­
fet. In the msnicipallties and other local
subdivislons, I recommend that the prlnÂ­
iple of local self-government be apÂ­
plied as once,Â­ so as to enable the inÂ­
tellIgent citizens of the Islond to parÂ­
iclnate in their own government, and
to learn by practical experience the duÂ­
ties nad requirements of self-contained
nd self-governing people. I have not
hongnt It wise to commit the entire
Sovernment of the Island to osmcers eeÂ­
ected by toe people, because I doubt
whether in habits, training and experÂ­
ience they re such as to fit them to
exercise to .o lsua a dgee oe

and expectation that they will soon or
rive at attainment of experlence and
wisdom and self-control that will
uetlify conferring upon them a much

their Iasular officers.

care, however, must be exercised that

that the history and racial pecullarltles

timenta and disregard of their nobligatlons
justly nrouses publc ctondemnation. The
guaranteas of 1le, llberty ad of clvil




 rights should be faithfully upheld, the
right of trial by jury respected and
defended. The rule of the courts should
assure the puulic of prompt trial of
those charged with criminal oflfenses.
and upon conviction the punishment
should be gommensurate with the uenormÂ­
Ity of the crime.
Those who, In disregard of law and
the public peace, unwilling to await the
Judgment of court and jury, conot'tute
themselves judges and executloners,
should not escape the severest penalties
for their crimes.
What I said In my inaugural address
of March 4. 21897. I now repeat:
""The constitutional authorities must
hbe eheerfully upheld. Lyuchlngs mest
not be tolerated in a great and civilized
country like the United States; courts,
not mous, must execute the penalties
of the laws. The preservation of pubÂ­
lic order, the right of disscuslon, the
Integrity of courts, and the orderly adÂ­
ministration of justice might continue
forever the rock of safety upon which
our government securely rests.""
In accordance with the act of coamÂ­
gress providing for an appropriate noÂ­
tloal celebration in the year 1900 oi
the establishment of the seat of gayÂ­
ernment In the district of Columbia. I
have appointed a committee consistlng
of governors of all the states and terÂ­
ritorles of the United States, who have
been invited to assemble In the city of
Washington on the 21st of December.
1899. which, with the comnmltee of conÂ­
gress and the district of Columbia, are
charged with thl proper conduct of
the celebration. Congress, at its last sesÂ­
slon, appropriated $5000 'to enable the
chief engineer of the army to continue
the dexaminotlon, of the subject, and to
make or secure designs, calculations and
estimates for
A BItEMORIAL BRIDGE
,irom the most convenient point of the
naval observatory ground or adjacent
thereto, across the Potomac river, to the
most convenient point of the Arlington
estate property.
In accordance with the provisions or
this act, the chief of engineers has seÂ­
lected four eminent bridge engineers to
submit competitive designs for a brhdge
combining the elements of strength and
durability and such archltectural embelÂ­
lishment and ornamentation as will fitly
apply to the dedication, ""a memorial of
American patriotism."" The designs are
now being prepared and as soon as comÂ­
p leted will be submitted to the congrea,
by the secretary of war. The proposed
bridge would be a conveniencne to all the
people from every part of the country
who visit the national cemetery; an orÂ­
nament to the capital of the nation, and
forever stand as a monument to AmeriÂ­
can patriotism. 1 don't doubt that con'
gress will give to the enterprise still furÂ­
ther proof of Its favor and approval.
The executive order of May 6, 1kM.,
extending the limits of the classtlled serÂ­
vice brought within the operation of the
civil service law and rules nearly all of
the executive civil service not previously
classifiled.
Some of the conclusions were found
wholly illogical and nunsuited to the work
of the several departments. The appliÂ­
cation of the rules to many of the places
so Included were found to result In trciÂ­
tlon and embarrassment. After long and
careful consideration It became evident
to the heads of the departments reaponÂ­
sible for theIr efficiency that In order to
remove those difficulties and promote an
efficient and harmonious administration
certain amendments were necessary.
These amendments were promulgated by
my executive order dated may 29, 0l0J.
The principal purpose of the order was
to except from competitive examlnation
certain places Involving fiduciary responÂ­
slblities or duties of a strictly conlÂ­
dentlal, scientific or executlve character,
whIch might be filled either by nonÂ­
competitive examlinatlon or In the disÂ­
cretion of the appointing officer, than by
open competition. These places were
comparatively cew In number. The orÂ­
der provides for the tilling of a much
larger number of places, mainly In the
outside service of the war department,
what is known as the registration sysÂ­
tem, under regulations to be approved hy
the president, similar to those whicn
have produced such admirable results In
the navy yard service. All of the amendÂ­
mants had for their main object a more
efficient and satisfactory administratIon
of the system of appointments as estanÂ­
lished by
THE CIVIL SERVICE LAW.
The results show that under thelr opÂ­
eration the public service has improved
and that the civil service system is reÂ­
lieved of many objectionable features
which heretofore subjected It to
just crIticism and the administrative aomÂ­
cers to the charge of unhuslnessilke
methods n the conduct of public affalrs.
It Is believed that the merit system has
beon greatly strengthened and Its perÂ­
manence assored. It will be my conÂ­
stant aim in the administration of govÂ­
ernment in our new posseslsions to make
fitness, character and merit essentials to
appointments to office, and to give the
capable and deserving inhabltants preferÂ­
ence In appointments.
The 14th of December will be the 100th
anniversary of the death of Washlngton.
For a hundred years the republic has bad
the priceless advantage of the lofty
standard of character and conduct which
he bequeathed to the American people.
It is an inheritance which time, instead
of wasting, continually increases and enÂ­
riches. We may justly hope that In the
years to come the benign Inluence or
the father of his country may be even
more potent for good than In the cenÂ­
tury which Is drawing to a close. I navw
been glad to learn that many parts
of the country will flttingly observe this
historic anniversary.

"404","358747","NEVER TOO OLD TO LEARN.
                 We extract the following from an article which appeared some months since in the Port. land-Orion, which forcibly illustrates, by refer. Once to well authenticated facts, the principle, that man i8 never too old to learn.
                 Socrates, at an extreme old age learnt toplay on musical instruments. This would look ri-  for some of the rich old men in our city, especially if they should take it into their heads to thrum a guitar under a lady s window which Socrates did not do, but only learnt to play some instrument of his time,-not a guitar, for the purpose of resisting the wear and tear of old age.
                 Cato, at eighty years of age, thought proper to learn the Greek language. Many of our young men at thirty and forty have forgotten the alphabet of a language the knowledge of which was necessary to enter college, and which was made a daily exercise through college. A fine comment upon their love of letters truly.
                 Plutarch, when between seventy and eighty, commenced the study of the Latin. Many ol our young lawyers, not thirty years of age,- think that nisi , , facias, &c., are English expressions; and if you tell them that a knowledge of the Latin would make them ap. pear a little more respectable in their prof.spion, tiu,. Nv!i rt,.;v that they ae too oid to  ol I learning the Latin.
                 Boccasio was thirty- years old, when he co  his studies in polite literature. Yet he became one of the three masters of the Tus- can dialect, Dante and Pctrarch being the other two. There arc many among us ten years younger than Boccasio who arc dying of ennui, and regret that they were not educated-to a taste for literature, but now they arc too old.
                 Sir Henry Spelman neglected the sciences in his youth, but commenced the study of them when he was between fifty and sixty years of age. After this time he became the most learn- ed antiquarian and lawyer. Our young men begin to think of laying their seniors on the shelf when they have reached sixty years of age.- How different the present estimate put upon ex- perience from that which characterized a certain period of the Grecian republic, when a man was not allowed to open his mouth in  or political meetings who was under forty years of age.
                 Colbert, the famous French Minister, at sixt5 years of age, returned to his Latin and law stud, ice. How many of our college learnt men have never looked into their classics since their grad. uation ?
                 Dr. Johnson applied himself to the Dutch lan. gage but a few years before his death. Most of our merchants and lawyers of twenty-five, thirty, and forty years of age, are obliged to ap- ply to a teacher to translate a business letter written in the Frncch langage, which might be learnt in the tenth part of the time required for the study of the Dutch-and all because they are too old to learn.
                 Ludivoco Monaldesco, of the great age of one hundred and fifteen, wrote the memoirs of his own times. A singular exertion, noticed by Voltaire, who was himself one of the most re-  instances of the progress of age to new studies.
                 Ogilby, the translator of Homer and Virgil was unacquainted with the Latin and Greek till he was past fifty.
                 Franklin did not  commence his philoso.  pursuits, till lie had reached his fiftieth year. How many among us of thirty, forty, and fifty, who read nothing but newspapers for the want of a taste for natural philosophy ! But they are too old to learn.
                 Accorso, a great lawyer, being asked why he began the study of law so late, answered that, indeed, he had began it late, but lie should there fore master it the sooner. This agrees with our theory, that a healthy old age gives a man the power of accomplishing a difficult study in much less time than would be necessary to one of half his years.
                 Dryden, in his sixty. year, commenced the translation of the Iliad; and his most plea- sing productions were written in his old age.
                 We could go on and cite thousands of exam. pies of men who commenced a new study, and struck out into an entire new pursuit, either for a livelihood or amusement, at an advanced age. But every one familiar with the biography of distinguished men, will recollect individual ca- ses enough to convince him, that none but the sick and indolent will ever say, I am too old to learn","unknown"

Be it enacted, etc., That there shall be appointed by the

holder of any office of profit or trust in the General or
State Government. The said commissioners shall be seÂ­

for an honest, impartial, and thorough investigation, and
shall hold office until their duties shall be accomplished, but
not to exceed one year. It shall be their duty to investiÂ­

distilled or spirituous as distinguished from the use of ferÂ­

the several States, and the effect produced
by such legislation upon the consumption of distilled or
spirituous liquors, or fermented or malt liquors; also to
ascertain whether the evil of drunkenness has been inÂ­

a stimulant or substitute for alcoholic drink has become
more general in consequence of such legislation, and
whether public morals have been improved thereby. It
shall also be the duty of said commission to gather inÂ­
formation, and take testimony as to whether the
evil of drunkenness exists to the same extent or more so
in other civilized countries, and whether those foreign
nations that are considered the most temperate in the use
of stimulants are so through prohibitory laws; also to what
degree prohibitory legislation has effected the consumption
and manufacture of malt and spirituous liquors in this
country.
SEC. 2. That the commissioners, all of whom shall not be
advocates of prohibitory legislation or total-abstinence in
relation to alcholic or fermented liquors, shall serve withÂ­

at a reasonable compensation, not to exceed $2,000
per annum, which with necessary expenses
incidental to such investigation, not exÂ­

Advice to Voung mien Who Are Afraid

of Workinr Xhemselvea to Death

And then remember, my son, you have
to work. Whether you handle a pick or

a pen, a wheelbarrow or a set ot books

digging ditches or editing a paper, ring

ing an auction-bell or writing 1 unity
tilings, you must work. If you will look

around vou son, vou will see that the

men who are most able to live the rest of

their days without work are the men who
work the hardest. Don't be afraid of
killing yourself with overwork, son. It
is beyond your power to do that. Men
cannot work so hard as that on the sunny
side of thirty. They die sometimes, but
it's liecause they quit work at C p. m. and
don't get home until 2 a. m. It's the inÂ­
tervals that kill, my son. The work gives
you an appetite for your meals, it lends
solidity to your slumber, it gives you a
perfect and grateful appreciation of a
holiday. There arc young men who do
not work, my sou ; young men who make
a living by sucking the end of a cane;
whose entire mental development, is itiÂ­
sutlicieiit to tell them which side of a posÂ­
tage stamp to lick ; young men who can

tie a necktie in eleven tlitlerent knots and
never lay a wrinkle iu it, and then would

get into a W est Hill street car logo to
Chicago; who can spend more money iu

l day than vou can earn in a mouth, sou.

and who will go to the sheriffs to buy a

postal card, and apply to the office of the

street commissioner for a marriage license
But the world is not proud of them, son

It docs not know their names, even: it

simply speaks of them as old Soansn'
hoys. Nobody likes them, nobody hate

them, the great, busy world docsn t even

know they are there, and at the grealday

of resurrection, if thev do not appear at

the sound of the truiiipet. and I hey cer

tainly will not unless somebody tells them

what it is for mid what to do, I don t

think Gabriel will miss them or notice

their absence, and they will not be sent
i for. or he disturbed. Things will goon

just as well without inein. .o mm out

"410","371653","A HUNDRED YEARS AGO.
                 HIEN it is considered how many and  have been the changes in this
                 country during the past hundred years, the propriety of a grand centennial celebration of the existence of our Republic can not be disputed. The Baltimore American, in a few paragraphs, reviews sonic of the leading features which mark our national advancement, and also the general progress of civilization in the century past:
                 ""One hundred and ten years ago there was not a single white man in what is now Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, or Ilinois. Then what is now the most flourishing part of the United States, was as little known as the country in the beart of Africa itself. It was not till 1776 that Boone left his home in North Carolina to become the first settler in Kentucky. And the first pioneers of Ohio did not settle till twenty years later still. A hundred years ago Canada belonged to France, and Washington waas a modest Virginia colonel, and the United States was a loyal part of the British Empire, and scarcely a speck on the political horizon indicated the struggle that in a few years was to lay the foundation of the greatest Republic of the world.
                 ""A hundred years ago there were but four small papers in America; steam-engines had
                 not been imagined, and locomotives, and steamboats, and railroads, and telegraphs, and postal-cards, and friction matches, percussion caps, and -loading guns, and stoves, and furnaces, and gas for dwellings, and India-rubber shoes, and Spaulding's glue, and sewing-, and anthracite coal, and photographs, and chromo-printing, and kerosene oil, and the safety-lamp, and the compound blow-pipe, and free schools, and spring mattresses, and wood engravings, and Brussels carpets, and lever watches, and greenbacks, and cotton and woolen factories, in anything like the present meaning of these terms, were utterly unknown.
                 ""A hundred years ago the spinning-wheel was in almost every family, and clothing was spun and woven and made up in the household; and the printing-press was a cumbrous machine worked by hand; and a nail, or a brick, or a knife, or a pair of scissors or shears, or a razor, or a woven pair of stockings, oran ax, or a hoe, or a shovel, or a lock, or a key, or a plate or glass of any size, was not made in what is now the United States. Even in 1710 there were only seventy-five post- in the country, and tho whole extent of our post-office routes was less than nineteen hundred miles. Cheap postage was unheard of,
                 and had any one suggested the transmission of messages with lightning speed, he would have been regarded utterly insane.
                 "" The microscope on one hand, and the telescope on the other, were in their infancy as instruments of science, and geology and chem-
                 istry were almost Unknown. In a word, it is true that to the century past, have been allotted more improvements, in their bearing upon the comfort and happiness of mankind, than to any other which has elapsed since the creation-of the world","unknown"

To the White House:
The President's tragic death' was a sad s
necessity but it will unite the Republican (
party and save the Republic. t
Life is a flimsy dream and it matters litÂ­ f
tle when one goes. A human life is of
small value. During the war thousands
of brave boys went down without a tear.
Ipresume that the President was a ChrisÂ­

It will be no worse for Mrs. Garfield,
dear soul, to part' Â« th her husband in this
way than by a nati""al death. He is liable
to go at any time and in any way.
I had no ill will toward the President.
His death was a political necessity. I am
a lawyer, a theologian and a politician.
I am a Stalwart of the Stalwarts. I was
with General Grant and the rest ox our
men in New York during the canvas. I

The papers referred to above have not

Andrews, who is the Washington corresÂ­ r
pondent of the Chicago Inter Ocean, says
that while it is true that a package of
papers is in the hands of the police accomÂ­ 9
panied by a note addressed to himself r
(Andrews), he has not a personal acÂ­
quaintance with Guiteau and never heard
of his existence until this morning. From i
what he has gathered from the police, d
Andrews believes that Guitean's home is
Sin
Freeport, Illinois.
Another Letter.
The following letter was found on the
street shortly atter Guiteau's arrest, the enÂ­


velope unsealed and addressed: ""Please r
deliver at once to General Sherman or his
first assistant in charge of the War DepartÂ­
ment:""
To General Sherman:-Â­
I have just shot the president. I shot f
him several times,as I Wished him to go as f
easily as possible. His death is a political a
necessity. I am a lawyer, theologian and
politician. I am a Stalwart of the StalÂ­ i
warts. I was with Gen. Grant and the l
rest of our men in New York during the I
canvas. I am going to the jail. Please
order out your troops and take possession
of the jail at once.
Very Respectfully,
(Signed) CHARLES GUITEAU.

Columbia, and Maj. Wm. G. Brock, chief
of Police. I don't know the writer, never I

WWr. T. SHERMAN, General.
I ho Blie Ea-Theorles in Ief-gard to the 1
Aneanoination-meported that he had
an Accomplice.
TWASHINGTON, July 2. Chas. Guiteau,
the assassin, is a Canadian Frenchman.
He has been here since February with
recommendations from parties in Illinois
for the Consulship to Marseilles. He has
acted strangely at his boarding house;
claimed acquaintance with Gen. Logan
who ignored him, and has not paid his
1 board.
a There is a theory which has many adÂ­
a
herents that the attempted assassination
was not the work of a lunatic, but is the
result of a plot much deeper and darker
than has been suspected. In support of
0
this theory is the statement that Guiteau
h
arranged beforehand with a hackman to
5
drive him swiftly in the direction of the
Congressional cemetery as soon as he
made his appearance on returning from
1
the depot. In the meantime he had a bunÂ­ I
I dle of papers in the hands of a boy with a
t view, it is maintained, to creating a belief ,
y
in his insanity in the event of his capture.
t Guiteau said on his way to jail that the
e
President's assassination was premeditated
and he went to Long Branch for the purÂ­
s
pose of shooting him there and there was
s
deterred by the enfeebled and saddened
a condition of Mrs. Garfield, which appealed
,f so strongly to his sense of humanity that
a
he came back without carrying out his inÂ­
y
tention.
Those by whom Guiteau has been exÂ­
.amined since the shooting say that he
e shows no symptoms of insanity and it is
e understood that the letter which has
a already been telegraphed, addressed to the
,f
White House is the only document in the
,s collection which supports the theory of inÂ­
n
sanity. It is reported that Guiteanu had an
accomplice whose description is in the
e hands of the police and further developÂ­
d ments are anxiously looked for.

The work of the Statisticrel division of the
Department of Agriculture deals with all
that relates to the economics of farming.
The main purpose of its monthly reports is
to keep the farmers informed as fully as pos.
sible of all matters having any in.ufluece
upon the world's markets in which their
products find sale. Its publications relate
esoecially to the commercial side of farming.
It is therefore of profound importance and
vital conceri to the farmers, of the United
States who reprsoent nearly one-half of our
population and also of direct interest to the
whole country, that the work of this division
be efficiently performed and that the inforÂ­
maation it has gathered be promptly diffused.
Jt is a matter for con.gratulatniotn to know

to make this part of his work thoroughly
vseful.
""WASTEFUL DISTRIBUTION OF SEEDS.
In the year 18309 the congress approÂ­
priated $1,000 to be taken from the patent
gffiee funds. for the purpose of collecting
and dis:tribubting rare and improved vaÂ­
rieties of seeds and for prosecuting
4gricultural investimations and procurina
agricultural rstatist.cs. From this small beÂ­
gincning the seed division of the Department
6of Agriculture has grown to its present unÂ­
wieldy and unjustifiable extravagant proÂ­
po.rtions. During th.e last fiscal year the
cost of seeds. Drchased was $66,548.01.
The remainder of an appropriation of 8135,Â­
Q0o was expended in pulling them up and
distrihuting them. It surely never could
haveo entered the mi.nds of those who first
sanctioned appropriations of public money
fpr the purchase of new and improved vaÂ­
rieties of seeds for gratuitous distribution
that from this would grow large appropriÂ­
atiou, for th!e p:urchase and distribution by
members of coinireseof ordiaary seeds, bulbs
.kmd cuttings whichi are common in all the
aitates and territories and everywhere easily
obtainnable at low prices.
In each state and territory an agricultural
experimeint station has been esta.blish:ed.
These stations, by their very character and
iDame, are the proper anen.eies to experiment
i'.ith and test n!w varieties of seeds; and
yet this indiscriminate and wasteful dise
tib-utiop by legisl.ition and legislato.rs conÂ­
tinues, anhswering no purpose unless it be to
re-mind constitents that their TeprOseCataÂ­
tives are will.ing to remember them with
gratuities at pu blic cost.
Under the sinctrioi of existing legislation
there was.. sent out from the Agricultural deÂ­
partment enough of cabbage seed to plant
L9,200 acres of land; a suflicient quantity of
beairs to plant 4.000 acres; beet seed enough
to plant 2,500 acres; sweet corn enough to
plant 7,800 acres; sutficient cucumber r seei
to cover 2,025 acres with vines, and enough.
nmuskmelon and watermelon seods to wLhtiat
,(75 acres, The total quantity of flower
and vegetable seeds thus distributed
was contained in more than 9.00s,000
paookages and. they were sufficient, if pl.anted,
to cover 89,59.6 acres of .land. In view of
these facts this enormous .extpenditure,
Without legitipiate returns o.f benefit, ought
to be abolished. Anticipating a cons.minaÂ­
io so manifestly in the interests of .good
Adlministration, more than $100,000 ihas
been stricken from the estimtateto cover this
o.bject. for the year ending June 30, 1805;
and the secretary recommends that the reÂ­
iPaining $35,000 of the estimate be confined
strictly to the purchase of new and imÂ­
proved varieties of seeds, .and that these be
d.istributed throug.h experiment stations.
Thus the seed. will be tested; and after test.

'J'HE civ1L SERVIi LA1W. W
The continued intelligent execution of the fo
Civil-servie. law and the increasing a pÂ­ P
proval by the people of its; operation are
most gratifying. The recent extension of its E
limitations and regulations to the employee
at free delivery postoffices which has been
honestly and promptly accoipliseed by the
commissian with the hearty coSpÃ½Iration of
the postmaster-general is an iimmensely imÂ­ IN
portant .advance in the usefulness of theo
system. I am, if possible more than ever conÂ­
vilu:ced of the incalculable beneths conferred
by the Civil-service ,aw not onlyv in its r<
effect upon the public service, but also what to
is. even more i.mportant, inits effi'ect i el.evatÂ­ t
ing the tone of political life gen.erally, i
The course of civil service reform in this m
country instructively and interestingly illusÂ­
trates how strong a hold a movement gains bI
upon our people whi.ch has underlying it a
sentiment of justice and right and wvich at in
the same time promises better adeministraÂ­ d
tion of their government. The law embodyÂ­ of
i:ng this reform found its way to our statute Is
book more from fear of the popular senti t
meat existing in its favor thain from any of
love for the reform itself on the part of the lI
legislators, and it has lived and grown and of
flourished in spite of the open, hostility iof 1
spoilsment aund notwithstandinlg the queruÂ­ c.
lous impructicability of many self-constiÂ­
.
tuted guardians. Beneath all the vagaries 0
and sublimated theories which are attracted a
to it there underlies this reform a sturdy o0
common sense principle not only suited to P
this mundane sphere, but whose appl.ication t
our people are more and more recognizing PI
to be absolutely essential to the most sa-C,
cessful operation of their governmoent, if not s
to its perpetuity.
CLERiKS NEEIDED ORn THE COMMISSION,
It seems to be entirely inconsistent with
the character of this reform, as well as with l
its best enforcement, to oblige the comrm isÂ­ tl
aion to rely for clerica:l assistance upon i
clerks detailed from other depart n-nts.
w
There ought not be suceh a condition in a
department that clerks hired to do the work rn
thera can be spared to habitually work at
ahother place, and it does not accord with fr
a sensible view of civil service ref[orm thatv
persons should be employed on the theory
1
that their labor is necessary in one departÂ­
DÂ­
ment when in point of fact their services are I
devoted to entirely different work iin a.nother
0
department.
1 earnestly urge that the clerks necesen.ry
to carry on the work of the commission be
regularly put upon its roster, aid that the
system of obligin,g tle c.ommissioners to rely
upon the services of clerks beionging to o
other departments be discontinued. Thtis w
ought not to increase the expense to the ol
goveornment, while it would certainly be ci
more consistent andil add greatly to the ft
efficiency of the coimmnission. It
THim DUPFY OF 'PULIC ECONOMY. fi
Econioamy in public expenditure is a duty
that can not innocently be neglected by those ti
intrusted w.ith the control of money drawn cm
from the people for public uses. It must be si
confessed that our apparently endless reÂ­
sources, the familiarity of our people with fr
immense accumulations ol weiltl, thi growÂ­
in.g sentiment among tnrlm that the expenuidiÂ­ a
ture of public money' should in some man ner

presents itself as bonth ne opportunity and a

to it. Ii there is anything in the theory of a ,

and their desires, if public ofcicers are really

promises and professiur;s hfave any ""binding
force, our failure to give the relief so long
awaited will be she:er recreacy. Nothing
shaould intervene to distract our attention d
or disturb our efort until this reform is acÂ­
c0mplinshed by vise and careful legislation.
While we should stauntchly adhere to the
princiule that only the necessity of revenue
justifies the imposition of tariff duties and
other federal taxation, and that they shouldi t
be limited by strict economy, we cannot
close our eyes to the fact that conditions
have grown up among us which in justice
and fairness call for discrimurnting care in
the distribution of such d.uties and. taxation
as the emergencies of our government
actually demand, Manifestly if we are to
aid the people directly through tariff reform r
one of its moat obvious features should be a
reduction in present tari charges upon the
necessaries of life. The benefits of such
a
reduction would be palpablo and substariÂ­
tial, seen and felt by thousaunds who woualt
be better fed. and better clothed and better
sheltered. Thtese gifts should be the willingt
b.enefa.ctions of a government whose highest
function is the promotion of the welfare of
i
the
people. Not less closely related to our
people's prosperity and wellbeing is the reÂ­
Smoval of restrictiona upon the importation
Sof the raw materials necessary to our manuÂ­
facturers. The world should be open to
our national ingenuity and enterprise,
This cannot be while federal legislation,
t through the imposition of high tariff, forbids
to Amiferican manufacturers as cheap maÂ­
te.rials as those used by their competitors.
It is quite obvious that the enhancement of
the price of our manufactured products reÂ­
sulting from this policy not only confines
t the market for these products within oui'
own borders, to the direct disadvantage of
our malufacturers, but also increases their
cost to our citizens. The interests of labor
a nro certainly though!l indirectly involved in
this feature of our tariff system, The sharp
ct ompetition and active struggle among our
manufacturers to supply the limited demand
fir their goode soon fill the narrow market
a to which they are confined. Then follows a
s.uspension of work in miils and lactories, a
discharrge of employes and distress in the
d homs of our workingmen.
d Even if the often disproved assertion
it
could he. made good that a lower rate of
y
wages would result from free raw materials
L'
and low taiiff duties, the lutelience of our
workingmen leads theta quickly to discover
' that their steady employment, permitted by
y free raw .materials, is the most important
5 factor in their relation to tariff legislation.

To the Senate and Hlouse of ReCpnieseintatiesiC
t
The year that has passed since the submisÂ­
Ssion of my last message to Congress has, esÂ­
pecially during the latter part of it, been an
-
eventful one to the country. In the midst of
great national prosperity a financial crisis has
11
occured that has brought low fortunes of giÂ­
gantic proportions; political partizanship has
almost ceased to exist, especially in the agriÂ­
cultural regions; and finally, the capture upÂ­
on the high seas of a vessel bearing our flag
has, for a time, threatened the most serious
consequences and has agitated the public
mind from one end of the country to the othÂ­
er. But this, happily, now is in the course of
satisfactory adjustment honorable to Lboth naÂ­
tions concerned.
OUR ]FOREIGN RELATIONS.
Tise relations of the United States, howevÂ­
er, with most of the other powers, continue
to be friendly and cordial. With France,
Germany, Russia, Italy and the minor EuroÂ­ I
peon powers, with Brazil and most of the I
r
South American Republics, and with Japan,
nothing has occurred during the year to deÂ­
mand special notice. The correspondence 1
between the Department of State and various I
diplomatic representatives in or from those I
countries, is transmitted herewith.
THE VIENNA EXIIIBITON.
In executing the will of Congress as exÂ­ d
pressed in its joint resolution of the 14th of r
February last, and in accordance with the
provisions of the resolution, a number of
practical artizans, of scientific men, and
honorary commissioners were authorized to
attend the exposition at Vienna, as CommisÂ­ a
sioners on the part of the United States. It t
is believed that we have attained the object t
which Congress had in view when it passed 0
t!e joint resolution in order to enable the
people of the-United States to participate in
the advantages of the international exhibiÂ­ ft
tion of the products of agriculture, manufac b
tures and the fine arts, to be held at Vienna. t
I take pleasure in adding that American exÂ­ c
hibitors have received a gratifying number
v
of diplomas and medals. During the expo
sition, a conference was held at Vienna for
the purpose of consultation on the systems
prevailing in other countries for the perfecÂ­
tion ofinventions. I authorized a representaÂ­
tive from the patent oflice to be present at s:
Vienna at the time when this conference was is
to take place, in order to aid, as far as he n
might, in securing any possible additional d
protection to American inventors in Europe.
The report of this agent will be laid betbre
Congress.
EIELATIONS WaITH CHILNA.
It it is my pleasant duty to announce to n
Conigress that the Emperor of China, on atÂ­ tl
taining his majority, received the diplomatic v
representatives of the western powers in perÂ­ a
son. An account of these ceremonies and of o
the interesting discussions which preceded t<
them, will be found in the documents transÂ­ ri
mlsitted herewith. The accompanying papers p
show that some advance, although slight, has .
been made during the past year towards the a
suppression of the infamous Chinese Coolie S
trade. I recommend Congress to inquire p
whether additional leg.slation bf not needed S
on this subject. ti
THE GENEVA ARBITRATION.
The money awarded to the United States h
by the tribunal of arbitration at Geneva, was
paid by Her Majesty's Government a few
days in advance of the time when it woultl
have become payable, according to the terms
of the treaty. In compliance with the proÂ­ ti
visions of the acts of March 3, 1873, it was at
once paid into the treasury and used to reÂ­
deem, so far as it might, the public debt of
the United States, and the amount so reÂ­
deemed was invested in a five per cent regisÂ­ b'
tered bond of the United States for fifteen ,
millions, five hundred thnuand doelar5,wtienO Is;
Is now held by the Secretary of State, subject n:
to the future disposition of Congress. I reÂ­
new my recommendation, made at the openÂ­ s
ing of the last session of Congress, that a at
Commission be created fur the purpose of auÂ­ d,
diting and determining the amounts of the
several direct losses growing out of the deÂ­ f
struction of vessels and their cargoes by the tl
Alabama, the Florida or the Shenandoah afÂ­
ter leaving Melbourne,for which the sufferers
have received no equivalent or compensation, a
and of ascertaining the persons entitled to reÂ­
ceive compensation for the same, making the
computations upon the basis indicated by the
tribunal of arbitration at Geneva, and that t
the payment of such losses be authorized, to d
an extent not to exceed the awards of the triÂ­
bunal at Geneva,
THE NORTIWESTERN BOUNDARY. I
By an act approved on the 14th of February fi
last, Congress made provisions for completÂ­ h
ing, jointly with an officer commissioner to be p
named by IlHr Britanic Majesty, the deterÂ­ u
miniation of so much of the boundary line be. a
tween the territory of the United States and ji
the possessions of Great Britain, as was left
uncompleted by the Commissioners appointed o
under the act of Congress of August 11th, a
1S53. Under the provisions of this act, the Is
northwest water boundary of the United ti
States has been determined and marked in in
accordance with the award of the Emperor of p
Germany. A protocol and a copy ofthe map ti
upon which the line was thus marked are a
contained in the papers submitted herewith. p
I also transmit a copy of the report of the al
Commissioners for marking the northern h
boundary between the United States and the n
British Possessions west of the Lake of the ri
Woods, of the operations of the Commission a
during the past season. Surveys have been o
made to a point 497 miles west of the Lake of p
the Woods, leaving about 330 miles to be surÂ­ 0
veyed, the field work of which can be comÂ­ t
pleted during the next season. d
THE MIXED CLAIMS COJMJMISSION.
The mixed Commission organized under the j
provisions of the treaty of Washiugton tor setÂ­ c
tling and determining the claims of citizensof a
either power against the other, arising from n
acts commnitted against their persons or propÂ­ d
,rt.e delrinse the neriod between Anril 13 1801.


and April Oth, 1865, made its Linal award on
the 25th day of September last. It was
awarded that the Government of the United
States should pay to the Government of Her g
Britanic Majesty, within 12 months from the t
date of the award, the sum of $1,929,819 in t
gold. The commission disallowed or dismissÂ­ t
td all other claims of British subjects against t
the United States. The amount of the claims a
presented by British subjects, but disallowed t
or dismissed, is understood to be about $93,Â­ f
000,000. It also disallowed all the claims of t
citizens of the United States against Great g
Britain which were referred to it. I recomÂ­
mend the early passage of an act appropriatÂ­ i
ing the amount necessary to pay this award
against the United States.
I have caused to be communicated to the t
Government of the King of Italy, the thanks
of this Government for the eminent services
rendered by Count Corti as the third ComÂ­
missioner on this Commission. With dignity,
learning and impartiality, he discharged t
duties requiring great labor and constant paÂ­
tience, to the satisfaction, I believe, of both
Governments.
I recommend legislation to create a special
court to consist of three judges, who shall be f
empowered to hear and determine all claims ,
of aliens upon the United States arising from I
acts committed against their persons or propÂ­
erty during the insurrection. The recent
reference under the treaty of Washington,
>o
was confined to claims of British subjects,
arising during the period named in the trea
w ty,butIt is also understood that there are
other British claims of a similar nature, arisÂ­
ing after the 9th of April 1865, and it is
known that other claims of a like nature, are
advanced by citizens or subjects of other powÂ­
ers. It is desirable to have these claims exÂ­
amined and disposed of.
THE ACHEEN WAR.
Official information is being received from
the Dutch Government of a state of war beÂ­
tween the King of the Netherlands and the
iL Sultan of Acheen. The officers of the United
States who were near the seat of the *ar
were instructed to observe an Impartial neuÂ­
trality. It is believed that they have done so.
THE MEXICAN COMMISSION.
The Joint Commission under the convenÂ­
tion with Mexico of 1868 has again been
legally prolonged and has resumed its busiÂ­
ness which it is hoped may be brought to an
early conclusion. The distinguished repreÂ­
sentative of Her Britannic Majesty at WashÂ­
y ington hass kindly consented,,wlth the apÂ­
proval of his government, to assume. the
arduous and responsible duties of umpire in
f this Commission and to lend. the weight of
as his character and namge to such decisions-as
mCt ay not receive the.acquiescence of both the,
arbitrators appointed by. the respective govÂ­
ernments.




 The Commissioners appointed pursuant to
the authority of Congress to examine into
the nature and extent of the forays of tresÂ­
passers from that country upon the herds of
Texas, have made a report which will be subÂ­
tmitted for your consideration.
THE VENEZUELANW COMMISSION.
The Venezuelan Government has been apÂ­
s
prised of the sense of Congress in regard of
award of the joint commission under the I
convention of the 25th of April, 1860,as exÂ­
pressed in the act of the 25th of February
last. It is apprehended that that GovernÂ­
ment does not realize the character of its obÂ­
ligations under that convention. There is
reason to believe, however, that its hesitancy t
in recognizing them springs in part, at least,
f from real difficulty in discharging them in
connection with its obligations to other govÂ­
ernments. The expediency of farther forÂ­ t
bearance on our part is believed to be worÂ­ t
thy of your consideration.
OUR CONSULS IN TUBKEY.
The Ottoman government and that of t
Egypt have latterly shown a disposition to reÂ­ t
lieve foreign consuls of the judicial powers
which heretofore they have exercised in the t
Turkish dominions, by organizing other triÂ­ t
bunals. As Congress, however, has by law s
provided for the discharge of judicial funcÂ­ F
tions by consuls of the United States in that c
quarter, under the treaty of 1830, I have not t
felt ready formally to accept the proposed c
change without the assent of Congress,whose
decision upon the subject, at as early a peÂ­
riod as may be convenient, is earnestly reÂ­
quested. t
SAN DOMINGO.
I transmit herewith, for the consideration
and determination of Congress, an applicaÂ­ b
tion of the Republic of Santo Domingo for c
this Government to exercise a protectorate
over that Republic.
NEW TREATIES.
Since thei adjournment of Congress, the
following treaties with foreign powers have t
been proclaimed:-A naturalization convenÂ­ Â°
tion with Denmark; convention with MexiÂ­
co for renewing the claims commission; a conÂ­ Ii
vention of friendship, commerce and tradition t
with the Orange Free State; and a naturalizÂ­ Ã½'
ation convention with Ecuador.
COMMISSIONING POSTAL OFFICIALS.
A recommendation was male in my mosÂ­ p
sage of December, 1870, that Congress authorÂ­
ize the Postmaster-General to issue all comÂ­
1
missions to oflicials appointed through his
department. t
CITIZENS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES.
I invite tile earnest attention of Congress IY
to the existing laws of the United States S
respecting expatriation and the election of in
nationality by individuals. Many citizens of w
the United States reside permanently abroad o
with their families; by the provisions of the
act approved February 10, 1855, the children te
of such persons are to, be deemed and taken tt
to be citizens of the United States; but the t
rights of citizenship are not to descend to
persons whose fathers never resided in the
United States. It thus happens that persons
who have never resided within the United tc
States have been enabled to put forward a ti
pretension to the protection of the United
States against the claim of military service of u
the government under whose protection they s
were born a id have been reared. In some m
cases naturalized.citizens of the United States I'
have returned to thi land of their birth with
intent to remain there, and their children, p
the issue of a marriage contracted there after ti
their return and who have never been in the d
United States, have laid claim to our protecÂ­ d
tion, when the lapse of many years have imÂ­
posed upon them the duty of military service
to the only governmeht which had ever known
them personally.
Until the year 1863, it was left embarrassed
by conflicting opinions of coqrts and ofjurists
t.A6trtbodoi~arj nea ~pernetÂ­ c
ual allegiance derived from our former coloÂ­
nial relations with Great Britain, was appliÂ­
cable to American citizens. Congress wisely
swept these doubts away by enacting-that
any declaration, instruction, opinion, order or st
decision of any officer of this Government,
which denies, restricts, impairs or questions
the right of expatriation, is inconsistent with e
the fundamental principles of the GovernÂ­ d
ment; but Congress did not indicate in that sl
statute, nor has it since done so, what acts
are to be deemed to work expatriation. i
For my own guidance in determining such
questions I required, under the provisions of '
the Constitution, the opinion in writing of Ct
the principal officer in each of the Executive ti
departments upon certain questions relating g
to this subject. The result satisfied me that ti
further legislation has become necessary. of
I therefore commend the subject to the careÂ­
ful consideration of Congress, and I transmit t(
herewith copies of the several opinions of the w
principal officers of the Executive departÂ­ a
mernts, together with other correspondence n
and prominent information on the same subÂ­ 0o
ject. P1
The United States, who led the way in the
overthrow of the feudal doctrine of perpetuÂ­
al allegiance, are among the last tb indicate s,
how their own citizens may elect another naÂ­ 21
tionality. The papers submitted herewith $
indicate what is necessary to place us on a c,
par with other nations in liberality of legislaÂ­ it
tion on this international question. We have v
already it our treaties assented to the princiÂ­ d
ples which would need to be embodied in the g
laws intended to accomplish such results; we n
have agreed that citizens of the United States n
may cease to b3 citizens, and may voluntarily o
render allegiance to other powers; we have o
agreed that residence in a foreign land withÂ­ t
out intent to return shall of itself work exÂ­
patriation; we have agreed, in some instances,
on the length of time necessary for such inÂ­ o
tent. I invite Congress now to make out and a
define when and how expatriation can be acÂ­
complished; to regulate by law the condition
of American women marrying foreigners; to t
fix the status of children born in a foreign c
country of American parents, and residing
more or less Dermanertlv habroad: and to p


make rules for determining such other kinÂ­ s
dred points as may seem best to Congress. d
PREPUBLIOAN SPAIN AND SLAVEIIOLDING
CUBA.
In compliance with the request of ConÂ­ t:
gress I transmitted to the American MinisÂ­ P
ter at Madrid with instructions to present it a
to the Spanish Government, the joint resoluÂ­ p
tion approved on the third of March last, L
tendering the-people of Spain in the name ""
and on the behalf of the American people,
the congratulations of Congress upon the efÂ­
forts to consolidate in Spain the principles of
universal liberty in a Republican form of
government.
The existence of this new Republic was
inaugurated by striking the fetters from the
slaves in Porto Rico. This benificent measÂ­
ure was followed by the release of several
thousand persons illegally sold as slaves in
Cuba; next the Captain-General of that coloÂ­
ny was deprived of thepower to set aside the
order of his superiors at Madrid, which had t
pertained to the office since 1825; the sequesÂ­
tered estates of American citizens which had
been the cause of long and frequent corresÂ­
pondence, were ordered to be restored to
their owners.
All these liberal steps were taken in the I
face of violent opposition directed by thereÂ­ I
actionary slanderers of Havana, who are vainÂ­
ly striving to stay the march of ideas which t
has terminated slavery In christendom, Cuba I
only,excepted. Unhappily, however, this baneÂ­ c
ful influence has thus far succeeded in deÂ­ I
feating the effects of all liberal-minded men c
in Spain to abolish slavery in Cuba, and in
preventing the promised reform in that r
-
island. The struggle for political supremacy t
continues. The pro-slavery and aristocratic
3 element in Cuba is gradually arraying itself I
- in more and more open hostility and defiance
of the home government, while it still mainÂ­
talns a political connection with the republic
in the peninsula; and although usurping and
a

ment, whenever such usurpation or defiance

 THE VaI0nIIUS DIFFICULTY. I
The s!eamr irginluas was, on the 26th day of tl
September, 1870, duly registered at New York as a
part of She commercial marine of the United States.
On the 4th of October, 1870, having received the cerÂ­ p
tificate of her register in the usual legal form, the b
sailed from the port of New York and tas not since is
been within the territorial Jurisdiction of the UnitÂ­
ed States. On the 3lst day of October last, while
sailing under the flag of the United States, on the Ci
high seas. she was forcibly seized by the Spanish V
gunboat 'T'ornado and was carried into the port of s8
Santiag, de Cuba where many of her passengere E
and crew were inhumanly and, so far, at least, as
relates to those who were citizens of the United d.
States, were without due process of law, put, to tl
death. ti
It is a well established principle, asserted n
by the United States from the beginning of
their national independence, recognized by ti
Great Britain and other marrtime powers, te
and stated by the Senate in a resolution tr
passed unanimously on the 10th of June 1858, tI
that American vessels on the high seas in tt
time of peace, bearing the American flag, reÂ­ sy
main under the jurisdiction of the country to tt
which they belong, and therefore any visitaÂ­ in
tion, detention or delay of such vessel by ca
the exhibition of force on the part of a forÂ­ ni
eign power, is in derogation of the sovereignÂ­ to
ty of the United States. In accordance with lo
this principle the restoration of the Virginius it
and the remainder of the survivors of her B
passengers and crew, and a due reparation to or
our flag, and the punishment of the authoriÂ­ uf
ties who had been guilty of these illegal acts he
of violence was demanded. cc
The Spanish Government has recognized pi
the justice of the demands and arranged for at
immediate deliverance of the vessel and for tb
the surrender of the survivors of the passenÂ­
gers and crew, and for a salute to the flag, to
and for proceedings looking to the punishÂ­ as
ment of those who may be proved to have pe
been guilty of illegal acts of violence towards sp
citizens of the United States, and also to to
wards indemnifying those who may be shown pr
to be entitled to indemnity. in
A copy of a protocol of a conference between the he
Secretary of State and the Spanish minister, in b
which the terms of this arrangement were agreed
to, is transmitted herewith. The correspondence w
on this subject with the legation of the United th
States, was buy cypher and by cable, and needs the mi
verification of the actual text of the correspondence
It has seemed to me t) be due to the importance of
the cwse not to subueic this correspondence until the
accura; e text can be received by mail. It is expected be
shortly, and will be submitted when received to
In ttkigl leave or this subject for the present, I
wi h to renew the expression of my conviction that co
the existetce of African slavery in Cuba is a pridclÂ­ pa
pal cause of the lamentable condition of the island. up
I do not doubt, that Congress shares wi h me the th
hipo that it aill soon be made to disappear. and that
peace and prr sperity may follow its abolition. The
embargoing of American estates in Cuba, the cruelÂ­ th
ty to American citizens detected in no act of hostility th
to the Spanish Government, the murdering or fs
prisoners taken with arms in their hands, and finalÂ­
ly the capture upon the high a as of a vessel sailing an
under the United States flag and bearing a United ce
States registry, has culminated in an outburst of up
indignation that has seemed for a time to threaten
war. Pending negotiations between the United of
States and the Government of Spain on the subject
of the capture, I have authorized the Secretary of ed
the Navy to put our navy on a war footing to the exÂ­ sa
tent, at least, of the entire annual appropriation for
that branch of the service, trusting to Congress andt
the ~iioion of the American people to justify my rep
act on. ic
CONSTITUTIO.NAL ALENDMIENT. be
Assuming from the action of the last Congress in eit
appointing a c mmitee of privuieges and elections th
to prepare and report to this Congress a constituÂ­
tional amendment to provide a better method of e
esecting the President and Vice-President of the
Uniteu States, and also, from the necessity of such ati
an a neodment, that there will be submitted to the ba
State legislatures tor ratification such an improveÂ­
ment in our constitution, I suggestedj two others for pi
y, r consideration:Â­ o v
First, to authorize the Executive to apÂ­ St
prove of so much of any measure passing the tu
two horses of Congress as his judgment may
dictate, without approving the whole-the ha
disapproved portion or portions to be subÂ­ pa
jected to the same rules as now, to wit:-to do
be referred, each to the house in which the cri
measure or measures originated, and if passed do
by a two-thirds vote of the two houses, then no
to become a law without the approval of the de
President. I would add to this a provisÂ­ th
ion that there should be no legislation by yo
Owesoaes dou' iu -the,.s tCsonayf,,. o.,ou i ruÂ£ no
its setting, except upon vetoes, in order to no
give the Executive an opportunity to examÂ­
ine and approveor disapprove the bills underÂ­ re
standingly. to
Second-To provide by amendment that sp
when an extra sestion of Congress is convenÂ­ co
ed by Executive proclamation, legislation frc
during the continuance of such extra session re;
shall be confined to such subjects as the ExÂ­ inl
ecutive may bring before it from time to time, cu
in writing. The advantages to be gained by en
these two amendments are obvious. One pr
session in each year is provided for by the pa
constitution, in which there are no restricÂ­ rei
tions as to the subjects of legislation by ConÂ­ vii
gress. If more are required, it is always in
the power of Congress, during their term of COt
office, to provide for sessions at any time. p
The first of these amendments would proÂ­ all
tect the public against the many abuses and ba
waste of public money, which creep into the mt
appropriation bills and other important cy
measures passing during the expiring hours r,
of Congress to which, otherwise, due considÂ­ ra
eration cannot be given. ha
TREASUIRY DEPARTMEt r. to
The receipts of the government from all tie
sources for the last fiscal year were $333,738,Â­ wi
204, and the expenditures on all accountsf
$290,345,245, thus showing an excess of reÂ­ ev
ceipts over expenditures of $43,392,959; but of
it is not probable that this favorable exhibit ca
will be shown for the present fiscal year. InÂ­ us
deed, it is very doubtful whether, except with
great economy on the part of Congress in th
making appropriations, and the same econoÂ­ in
my in administering the various departments
of government the revenue will not fall short
of meeting actual expenses, including the in-c
terest on the public debt.
ESONOSIY RECOMIM ENDED.
I commend to Congress such economy, :nd 5point fo
out two sources where it seems to me it might
commence, to 'it: In the appropriations for pubÂ­
lie boildngs in the many cities where work has not th
been commenced; in the appropriations for river th
and harbor improvements in those localities where th
the improvements are of but little benefit to general
cJmmerce, ands for fortifications. Re is a still th
more fruitful s ,urce of expenditure -'kich I will

od ofmanufacturing claims for losses incurred in
suppressing the late rebillim. I would not ba unÂ­ ti
dersaood here as opposing the erection of good, subÂ­ at
etantial, and even ornamettal buildings by the govÂ­
ernment whenever such buildings are needed; in Be
fact I approve of the government owning its own tr.
buildings in all sections of the country, and hope at
the day is not far distant when it will not oly
possess hem, but will erect in the capital suitablea
residences for all persons who now receive commuÂ­ isi
tation for quarters or rent at the government's exÂ­ at
penst, and for the Cabluet, taos setting an example pt
to'ofe States which may induce them to erect
buildings for their Senators; but I would have this of
work conducted at a time when the revenues of ri
he country would abundantly jas'ify it. be
THE FINANCIAL PANIC. et
The revenues have materially fallen off a
for the first five months of the present fiscal fo
year from the sum which they were expec ted
to produce, but owing to the general panic Cl
now prevailing, which commenced about the t
middle of September last, the full effect of this y(
disaster (if it should not prove a blessing in
disguise) is yet to be demonstrated. In either
event it is your duty to heed the lesson and hi
provide by wise and well considered legislaÂ­ as
tion, as far as it lies in your power, against hi
its recurrence, and to take advantage of all
benefits that may have accrued.
SPECIE PAYMENT. vi
My own judgment is that however much ai
individuals may have suffered, one long step re
has been taken toward specie payments; that
we can never have permanent prosperity unÂ­ cl
til a apecie basis is reached, and that a specie E
basis cannot be reached and maintained until et
our exports, exclusive of gold, pay for our al
imports, interest due abroad, and other speÂ­ a
cie obligations. ti
The development of the mines of precious t
metals diring the past year and the prospecÂ­ n
tive development of them for years to come, 0o
are gratifynlog in their results. Could oneÂ­
half of the gold extracted frofftlhe mines be t
retained at home, our advance toward specie w
payments would be rapid.
THE CUaBlENCY. II
Toincrease our exports, sufficient currenÂ­
cy s requiredto keep all the industries of v'
the country employed. Without this, naÂ­
tiona) as well as individual, bankruptcy g

a will result To hold
'w
we bape a appreciate our curreno y

 to that standard, is a problem deserving of
of
the most serious consideration of Congress. 1
The experience of the present panicÂ­ has
e-proven
that the currency of the country, I
te based, asit is, upon the credit of the country,
e is the best that has ever been devised. UsnÂ­ c
e
ally, in times of such trials, currency has beÂ­ c
1e
come worthless or so much depreciated In i
h value as to inflate the values of all the necesÂ­ t
3f
saries of life, as compared with the currency. g
"" Every one holding it has been anxious to c
,d dispose of it on any terms. Now we witness t
,
the reverse: holders of currency hoard as 8
they did gold in former experiences of a like c
d
nature. ii
if
It is patent to the most casual observer
y
that much more currency or money is required
i,
to transact the legitimate trade of the counÂ­
a
try during the fall and winter months, when
, the vast crops are being removed, than during
a the balance of the year. With our present 0
system, the amount in the country remains
o
the same throughout the entire year,xeanltÂ­ u
ing in an accumulation of all the surplus
y
capital of the country in a few centres, where
not employed in the moving of the crops, ri
tempted thereby by offers of interest on call tl
b
loans, interest being paid. This surplus capÂ­ ii
s ital must earn this interest paid, with a profit. t1
r Being subject to ""call,"" it cannot be loaned I
o
only in part, at best., to the merchant or manÂ­ v
ufacturer, for a fixed term; hence, no matter ti
s
how much currency there might be in the ti
country, it would be absorbed, prices keeping ci
I
pace with the volume, and panics, stringency
r and disasters would ever be recurring with ii
r
the autumn elasticity. u
In our monetary system there is the object n
to be obtained first, and next to that, as far et
as possible, a prevention of the use of other sa
s
people's money in stock and other species of et
s
speculation. To prevent the latter it seems
to me that one great step would be taken by p
I prohibiting the national banks from paying P
interest on deposits, by requiring them to c;
a
hold their reserves in their own vaults, and ti
by forcing them into resumption, though it gi
would be in only legal tender notes. For ai
I this purpose I would suggest the establishÂ­ ei
ment of clearing houses, for your consideraÂ­ ft
tion.
To secure the former, many plans have p
I been suggested, most, if not all, of which look at
to me more like inflation on the one hand, or tr
compelling the government, on the other, to T
pay interest, without corresponding benetits, of
upon the surplus funds of the country, during bi
the seasons when otherwise unemployed. ce
I submit for you consideration whether at
- this difficulty might not be overcome by auÂ­
r
thorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to isÂ­
sue at any time to the National banks of issue,
any amount of their notes, below a fixed per
i
centage of their issue-say forty per cent., f
f
upon the banks depositing with the Treasurer 01
of the United States an amount of government e
bonds equal to the amount of notes demandÂ­
ed-the banks to forfeit to the government b3
say four per cent. of the interest accruing on at
thebonds so pledged, during the time they i
remain with the Treasurer as security for the ft
increased circulation, the bonds so pledged to pm
be redeemable by the bank at their pleasure,
either in the whole or in part, by returning n
their own bills for cancellation, to an amount s
equal the face of the bonds withdrawn.
I would further suggest for your considerÂ­ ot
ation the propriety of authorizing national tr
banks to diminish their standing issue at
pleasure, by returning for cancellation their
own bills and withdrawing so many United hi
""
States bonds as are pledged for the bills reÂ­ ei
turned. t
In view of the great actual contraction that at
has taken place in the currency and the comÂ­ o
Sparative
contraction continually going on, e
due to the increase of population, the inÂ­ it
crease-of manufactures and all industries, I t
do not believe that there is too much of it i
now for the dullest period of the year. InÂ­
deed, if clearing houses should be established, ai
thus forcing redemption, it is a question for at
your consideration whether banking enould t
r
not be made froe, retaining all the safeguards et
now organized to secure bill holders. ci
In any modification of the present slaw
-
regulating national banks, as a further step t
towards preparing for the resumption of t
specie payments, I invite your attention to a
- consideration of the propriety of exacting d
from them the retention, as a part of their ei
reserve, either the whole or a part of the gold O0
-
interest accruing upon the bonds pledged as seÂ­ fu
curity for their issue. I have not reflected
enough on the bearing this might have in P1
producing a scarcity of coin with which to i
pay duties on imports, to give it my positive vi
recommendation; but your attention is inÂ­ l
"" vited to the subject. cc
During the lasttour years the currency has been
contracted directly by the withdrawal of the three
per cent certificates, compound interest notes, and
7-30 bonds outstanding on the 4th of March, 1869, Ct
all of which took tre place of legal tenders in the al
bank reserves, to the extent of sixty-three million
dollars Daring the same period there has been a i
much larger comparative contraction of the currenÂ­ re
cy. The population of the country has largely inÂ­ 1E
Screased,
more than twenty-five thousand miles of
railroad have been built, requiring the active use of
capital to operate them mihlons of acres of land
have b.eu opened to cultivation, requiring capital 31
to move the products, manufacturers have multiÂ­ 41
plied beyond all precedent in the same period of fi
I
time,requiring capital weekly for the payment of
wages,aud for the purchase of material and probably i
the largest of all comparative contraction arises gi
from the organizing of free labor iu the South. lRow
every laborer thus receives his wages, and for want
of savinga banks the greater part of such wages is
carried im the pocket or hoarded until required for rt
use. le
These suggestions are thrown out for your ei
consideration, without any recommendation p.
that they shall be adopted literally, but hopÂ­ ti
ing that the best method may be arrived at si
to secure such an elasticity of the currency as
will keep employed all the industries of the ti
country and prevent such an inflation as will n
put off indefinitely the resumption of specie er
payments-an object so devoutly to be wished id
for by all, and by none more earnestly than d
the class of people most directly interestedÂ­
-
Sthose
who earn their bread by the sweat of i
Stheir
brow. The decisions of Congress on 1
tthis subject will have the hearty support of w
Sthe Executive. e
SHIPBUITILDING. a
T - . .
. . 1, _ '4 .


in previous messages i nave canea attenÂ­
tion to the decline in American shipbuilding
and recommended such legislation as would
,
secure to us our proportion of the carrying
n
trade, stimulated by high rates and an
abundance of freight. The progress for the e
last year in shipbuilding have been very satÂ­
isfactory. There has been an increase of
about three per cent. in the amount transÂ­
ported in American vessels over the amount s
of last year. With the reduced cost of mateÂ­
f
rial which has taken place, it may reasonably
be hoped that this progress will be maintainÂ­ c
ed and even increased. However, as we pay e
f
about eighty million dollars per annum to
,1
foreign vessels for the transportation of our e
d
supplies and products to a market, thus inÂ­
c creasing the balance of trade against us to o
this amount, the subject is one worthy of
your serious consideration.
n CHEAP TRANSPORTATION.
r ""Cheap transportation"" is a subject that 1
d has'attracted the attention of both producers
and consumers and has contributed to, if it
t has not been the direct cause of, the recent o
I panic and stringency. As Congress at its last I
session appointed a special committee to inÂ­ '
vestigate this whole subject during vacation
h and report at this sessiod, I have nothing to p
recommend until this report is read.
, There is one wish, however, of a national e
character, in which the greater portion of the n
e East and West, the North and the South are s
ii equally interested, to which I will invite sour
Sattention: The State of New York has
a canal connecting Lake Erie with
tide water on the Hudson river, and 8
the State of Illinois has a similar work conÂ­
necting Lake Michigan with navigable water
on the Illinois River, thus making a water
communication, inland, between the East and 8
' the West and South. These great artificial t
e water courses are the property of the States C
e through which they pass, and pay toll to
those States. Would it not be wise statesÂ­
manship to pledge these States, that if they t
. will open these canals for the passage of large
) vessels,..*xe .general government *1l look
. after andkeep in navigable conditlod ""the
y great public highways with which theye
r nect, to wit: the overslanugh on the Hudaino, I
f' the St. Clair flats and the Illinois and [ls -
:
issippi Rivers ?
""
e This would be. a. ational work-one of I
Sgreat value to the tioducers of the West and
_ South, in giving them cheap transportation .
for their products to the, a-board and a
i
market, and the consttmere In the
, in t
giving them cheaper food, parlu ully of
8. those articles of ibod which do not find a
foreign market, and the prices of which,
Stherefore, are not reglskted by foreign de.
mands. The advantages of such t work are
too obvious for argument. I submit the subÂ­
ject to you, therefore, without further oom
mentu
if aPLonTTO or TO s AMAzoN.
.
d In attesnpt o regain omr lost emm e
syand
ctirybsg tide, I have heretofore calledi

 f your attention to the States south of the f
United States, offering a field where much e
s
might be accomplished to farther this object.
I suggest that a small appropriation be made, p
accompanied with authority for the Secretary r
of the Navy to fit out a naval vessel, to asÂ­ b
- clnd the'Amazon river to the month of the p
Sl
ttdhira, thence to explore that river and its d
-
tributaries into Bolivia, and toreport to ConÂ­ tI
gress at its next session, or as soon as practiÂ­ c
cable, the accesslbility of the country by waÂ­ a
I ter, its resources and population so reached. e
Such an exploration will cost but little; it is
can do no harm, and may result in establishÂ­ a
ing a trade of value to both nations. tl
TITE TArIFF 'LAW, ETC. n
In farther connection with the Treasury si
Department, I would recommend a revision
and codification of the tariff laws, and the n
opening of more mints for coining money, p
with authority to coin for such nations as
may apply. t
THE WA~ DEPARTMENT.
The attention of Congress is invited to the n
recommendations contained in the report of p
the Secretary of War, herewith accompanyÂ­ a
Ing. The apparent great cost of supporting a
the army Is fully explained by this report,and a;
I hope will receive your attention. While inÂ­ le
viting your attention to all the recommendaÂ­ sc
tions made by the Secretary of War there are c
two which I would especially invite you to o
consider: a
First, the importance of preparing for war a
in time of peace, by providing proper armaÂ­ o
ment foj our sea coast defences, proper armaÂ­ re
ment of vastly more importance than fortifiÂ­
cations. The latter can be supplied very
speedily for temporary purposes, when needÂ­
ed. The former cannot. t
The second is the necessity of reopening
promotion In the staff corps of the army. p
Particularly is this necessity felt in the mediÂ­
ca), pay and ordnance departments. At this
time it is necessary to employ contract surÂ­
geons to supply the necessary medical attendÂ­
ance required 'by the army. With the presÂ­ S
ent force of the pay department it is now difÂ­
ficult to make the payments to troops IfrovidÂ­
i
ed for by law. Long delays in payments are
productive of desertions and other demoraliz-10
ation, and the law prohibits the payment of
troops by other than regular army paymasters. a
There are now sixteen vacancies in the
ordnance department, thus leaving that of
branch of the service without sufficient offiÂ­
cers to conduct the business of the different re
arsenals on a large scale, if ever required.
NAVY DEPARrTMENT.
During the past year our Navy has been si
depleted by the sale of some vessels no longer tt
fit for naval service and by the condemnation a
of others not yet disposed of. This, howÂ­ bi
ever, has been more than compensated for by m
the repair of six of the old wooden ships and ""
by the building of eight new sloops ot war
authorized by the last Congress. The buildÂ­ tr
ing of the latter has occurred at a doubly ti
fortunate time. They are about being comÂ­ w
pleted at a time when they may possibly be
much needed, and the work upon them has d(
not only given direct employment to thouÂ­ A
sands of men, but has no doubt been the to
means of keeping open establishments for cc
other work at a time of great financial disÂ­ Pi
tress.
Since the commencement of last month,
however, the distressing occurrences which at
have taken place in the waters of the CaribÂ­ bi
ean sea, almost on our very sea-board, while el
they illustrate most forcibly the necessity ly
always existing that a nation situated like m
ours should maintain in a state of possible cm
efficiency a navy adequate to its responsibilÂ­ re
ities, has at the same time demanded that all at
the effective force we really have shall be put a
in immediate readiness for warlike service. w
This has been and is being done promptly ci
and effectually, and I am assured that all the bh
available ships and every authorized man of
the American navy will be ready for whatÂ­
ever action is required for the safety of our
citizens, or the maintenance of our honor.
This. or o a, wu aquire the expendlÂ­
ture in a short time oi some of the apprupriÂ­ t
tions which were calculated to extend a
through the fiscal year; but Congress will, I tl
doubt not, understand and appreciate the b
emergency, and will provide adequately, not If
only for the present preparation, but for the I
future maintenance of our naval force.
The Secretary of the Navy has during the a
past year been quietly putting some of our
most effective monitors in condition for serÂ­
vice, and thus the exigency finds us in a w
much better condition for war than we w
could possibly have been without his action.
a
POSTOFFICE DEPARTMENT.
A complete exhibit is presented in the acÂ­ se
companying report of the Postmaster-GenerÂ­ se
al of the operations of the Post-office DepartÂ­ al
ment during the year. The ordinary postal
revenues for the fiscal year ended June 0tbh,
1873, amounted to $22,996,741.57, and the exÂ­
penditures of all kinds to *29,084,045.67. The g
increase of revenues over 1872, was $1,081,Â­ m
315.20, and the increase of expenditures, $2,Â­
426,753.36, independent of the payments made at
from special appropriations for mail steamÂ­
ship lines. The amount drawn from the
general treasury to meet deficiencies, was
$5,265,475. The constant and rapid extenÂ­
sion of our postal service, particularly upon
railways, and the improved facilities for colÂ­ el
lection, transmission, distribution and delivÂ­ e:
ery of the mails, which are constantly beiug ti
provided, account for the increased expendiÂ­ is
tures of this popular branch of the public gi
service. of
The total number of post offices in operaÂ­ pi
tion on the 30th of June, 1873, was 33,244, a 2J
net increase of 1,81 over the number reportÂ­ w
ed the preceeding year. The number of pres. hi
idential offices was 1,363, an increase of 163 al
during the year. The total length of railroad I
mail routes at the close of the year was 03,4.57 g
miles, an increase of 5,546 miles over the year ai
1872. Fifty-nine railway post office lines ai
were in operation on the 30th of June, 1873, ci
extending over 14,866 miles of railroad routes, ie
and performing an aggregate service of 34,925 it
miles daily. The number of letters exchangÂ­ ci


ed with foreign countries was 27,459,185, an
increase of 3,096,685, over the previous year, $
and the postage thereon amounted to $2,021,Â­ tl
310.68. The total weight of correspondence y
exchanged in the mails with European court' si
tries exceeded 912 tons, an increase of 02 v
tons over the previous year. The total cost a
of the United States Ocean mail steamship g
service, including $725,000 paid from special si
appropriations to subsidized lines of mail p
steamers, was $1,047,271 35. a
New or additional postal conventions have been o
coclindedwilth Sweden, Norway, Belgium, GerÂ­ ti
many, Canada. New enoundland and Japan, reducÂ­
ing postage rates an correspondence exchanges with ti
those countries, and further effhrts have been Ci
made to conclude a satisfactory postal convention tf
with France, but without success. I invitoshe favÂ­ i
oratbla consideration of Congress to the suggestions
and recommendation of the Postmaster General ti
for an extension of the free-delivery system in all
cities having a population of not less than 10.000;
for the prepayment or postage on newspapers and
other printed matter of the second clasa; for a uniÂ­ 01
f lorm postage and limit of a eight in miscellaneous I
matter; for adjustlg the cowpensation of all postÂ­ t
masters not apponted by the President by the old
method of commission, the actual receipts of the Ct
G
office instead of the present mode of fixing the pay s5
in advance, upon special returns; and especially to et
urge favorable action by Congress on the important
reomthendations of the Postmaster General for the
establlshment of United States postal savings deÂ­ it
positoris. Your attention is also again called to a ei
conside, ationof thi question of the postal teleÂ­
graphs and the arguments adduced in support
thereof in the hope Iat you may take such action 1
in convention therewith as in your Judgment will b

for its total repeal, but if this is not considÂ­

questioned that those portions of said act

providing for what is called involuntary bankÂ­

could be made available for that purpose, to

meet all their liabilities, yet on account of the
extraordinary scarcity of money they may be
t
unable to meet all their pecuniary obligations
as they become due, in consequence of which
they are liable to be prostrated in their busiÂ­
ness by proceedings in bankruptcy at the inÂ­
stance of unrelenting creditors.
People are now so easily alarmed as to
monetary matters that the mere filing cf'a
petition in bankruptcy by an unfriendly
creditor will necessarily embarrass, and often
times accomplish the financial ruin of a
responsible business man. Those who otherÂ­
wise might make just and lawful arrangeÂ­
ments to relieve themselves from difficulties
produced by the present stringency in money,
are prevented by their constant exposure to
attack and disappointment by proceedings
I
against them in bankruptcy, and besides, the
""
law is made use of in many cases by obdurate
creditors to frighten or force debtors into a
compliance with their wishes, and into acts
of injustice to other creditors and to themÂ­
selves. I recommend that so much of said
act as provides for involuntary bankruptcy,
on account of the suspension of payment, be
""
repealed.
CLAIMS AGAINST THE OOVERNMEnT.
Your careful attentioni is invited.to the
subject of claims against the'government and
the facilities offered by existing laws for their
prosecution. Each of the departments of
State, Treasury and War, have demands for
many millions of dollars upon their files, and
they are rapidly accumulating. To these
may be added those now pending before
Congress, the Court of Claims and the
Southern claims commission, making in the
aggregate an immense sum. Most of these
grow out of the rebellion, and are intended
to indemnify persons on both sides for their
losses during the war, and not a few of these
are fabrications and supported by false testiÂ­
mony. Projects are on foot, it is believed, to
induce Congress to provide for new classes of
of claims, and to revive old ones through the
repeal or modification of the statute of limiÂ­
tation, by which they are now barred.
I presume these schemes, if proposed, will be reÂ­
ceived with little favor by Congress, and I recomÂ­
mend that persons having claims against the United
States cognizable by any tribunal or department
thereof, be required to present them at an early day
and that legislation be directed, as far as practicaÂ­
ble, to the defeat of unfounded and unjust demands
upon the government, and I could suggest, as a
means of preventing fraud, that witnesses be called
upon to appear in person to testify before those triÂ­
bunals having said claims before them for adjudicaÂ­
tion. Probably the largest saving to the national
treasury can be secured by timely legislation on
those subjects, of any of the economic measures that
will be proposed.
You will be advised of the operations of the
department of Justice by the reportof the
Attorney General and I invite your attention
to the amendments of existing laws suggestÂ­
ed by him with the view of reducing the exÂ­
penses of that department.
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR.
The policy inaugurated towards the Indians
at the beginning of the last administration has
been steadily pushed, and, I belueve,with benÂ­
eficial results. It will be continued with onÂ­
ly such modificationsas time and experience
may demonstrate as necessary. With the enÂ­
croachment of civilization upon the Indian
reservations and hunting grounds, disturbÂ­
ances have taken place between the Indians
and whites, during the past year, and probably
will continue to do so until each race appreÂ­
ciates that the other has rights which must
be respected.
INDIAN TERITOlY.
The policy has been to collect the Indians
as rapidly as possible on reservations and, as
far as practicable, within what is known as
the Indian territsrr, ..a . a. ~su tnem the
aat oriviization and self-support. When
found off their reservations and endangering
the peace and safety ot the whites, they have
been punished, and will continue to be, for
like offences. The Indian territory south of
Kansas and west of Arkansas is sufficient in
area and agricultural resources to support all
the Indians of the Rocky Mountains. In
time, no doubt, all of them, except a few
who may select to make their homes among
white people, will be collected there. As a
preparatory step for this consummation, I
am now satisfied that a territorial form of
government should be given them, which will
secure the treaty irghts of the original
settlers and protect their homesteads from
alienation for a period of twenty years.
THE PATENT OFFICE.
The operations of the Patent Office are
growing to such a magnitude, and the accuÂ­
mulation of material is so great, that the neÂ­
cessity for more room is becoming more obviÂ­
ous day by day. I respectfully invite your
attention to the reports of the Secretary of
the Interior and Commissioner of Patents on
this subject.
THE GENERAL LAND OFFICE.'
The business of the General Land Office
exhibits a material increase in all its branchÂ­
es, during the last fiscal year. During that
time there were disposed of out of the public
lands, 13,030,606 acres, being an amount
greater by 1,165,631 acres than was disposed
of the preceding year. Of the amount disÂ­
Sposed of~, 1,0260,266 acres were sold for cash;
214,940 acres were located with military land
warrants; 3,793,012 acres were taken for
homesteads; 053,440 acres were located with
agricultural college scrip; 6,083,536 acres
were certified by railroads; 70,576 acres were
-granted to wagon roads; 238,548 acres were
Sapproved to States as swamp lands; 138,681
acres were certified for agricultural colleges,
common schools, universities and seminarÂ­
ies; 190,775 acres were approved to States for
internal improvements; 14,222 acres were loÂ­
cated with Indian scrin.


The cash receipts during the same time were
$3,408,515.50, being $190,415.50 in excess of
Sthe
receipts of the previotis year. During the
year 30,483,132 acres of public lands were
surveyed, an increase over the amount surÂ­
veyed the previous year of 1,037,193 acres,and
added to the area previously surveyed, agÂ­
gregates 616,554,895 acres which have been
I
surveyed, leaving 1,218,443,505 acres of the
public land still unsurveyed. The increased
and steadily increasing facilities for reaching
our unoccupied public domain, and for the
transportation of surplus products, enlarges
the available field for desirable homestead loÂ­
cations, thus stimulating settlement and exÂ­
tending year by year, in a gradually increasÂ­
ing ratio the area of occupation and cultivaÂ­
tion.
THE PROPOSED BUSSIAN COLONY.
The expressed desire of the representatives
of a large colony of citizens of Russia to emÂ­
igrate to this country as it is understood with
the consent of their government if certain
concession can be made to enable them to
settle in a compact colony, is of great interÂ­
est, as going to show the light in which our
institutions are regarded by an industrious,
intelligent and wealthy people, desirous of
enjoying civil and religious liberty; and the
acquisition of so large an immigration of citÂ­
izens of a superior class would without doubt
be a substantial benefit to the country. I inÂ­
vite attention to the suggestion of the SecreÂ­
tary of the Interior In this behalf.
r-Nsro8s.
There was paid during the last fiscal year for penÂ­
slons, including trho xpenses of disbursement, g29,Â­
185,289.62, belng an amount less by $984,050.98 than
was expended for the same purpose the preceding
Syear. Although the statement of oxiondltares
would indicate a material reduction in amount
I compared with the preceding year, it is believed
I
that the changes in the pension laws at the last sesÂ­
sion of Congress will-absorb that amount the current
year. At the close ofthe last fiscal year there were
on the pension rolls a 804 invalid military penÂ­
sioners, and 112,088 widows, orphans and dependent
relatives of deceased soldiers, making a total
of that class of 211,892; 18,264 survivors of
the war of 1812, and 5,053 widows of soldiers
of that war, pensioned under the act of-ConÂ­
i
gress of February 14th, 1871, making a total
I of-that clas, of 23,319; 1,430 invalid Navy
pensioners, and 1,170 widows, orphans and
dependent relatives of deceased officers, sailÂ­
ors andl miinsies of the Navy, making a total
I of'Navy pensioners of 3,200 and a grand toÂ­
~al of pedsioners of all classes, of 238,411,
showing a net increase during the last fiscal
year of 6,182. During the last year the names
s of 16,405 pensioners were added to the rolls
and 10,223 names were dropped therefrom for
various causes.
The system adopted for the detection of
frauds against the government in the matter
of pensions has been productive
of satisfactory results, but legislation is needÂ­
ed to provide, if possible against the perpeÂ­
tration of such frauds in future.
. EDUCATION.
I The evidently increasing interest in the





cause of education is a most encouraging
feature in the general progress and prosperity
of the country, and the Bureau of Education
is tarnest in its efforts to give proper direcÂ­
tions to the new applicants and the increased
facilities which are being offered to aid the
educators of the country in their great work.
TyIE EgNSUS.
The ninth census has been completed, and
the report thereof published and distributed,
and the working force of the bureau disbandÂ­
ed. The Secretary of the Interior renews
his recommendation for a census to be taken
in 1875, to which subject the attention of
Congress is invited. The original suggestion
in that behalf has met with the general apÂ­
proval of the country, and even'if it be not
deemed advisable at present to provide for a
regular quinquennial census, a census taken
in 187, tihe report of which could be comÂ­
pleted and be published before the one hunÂ­
dredth anniversary of our independence,
would be especially interesting and valuable,
as showing the progress of the country durÂ­
ing the first century of our national existÂ­
ence.
It is believed, however, that a regular census every
flve ycars would be uo substantial benefit to the
country, Inasmuch as our growth hithelto has been
so raptll that the results of the decennial census are
niecesarily unreoiable as a basis of estimates for the
latter years of a decennial period.
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
Under the very efficient management of
the Governor and the Board of, Public
Works of this District, the city of WashingÂ­
ton is rapidly assuming the appearance of a
capital of which the nation may well be
proud. From being a most unsightly place,
three years ago, disagreeable to pass through
in summer, in consequence of the dust arisÂ­
ing from unpaved streets, and almost imÂ­
passable in the winter from the mud, it is
now one of the most sightly cities in the
country, and can boast of being the best
paved.
The work has been done systematically,
the plan. grades, location of sewers, water
and gas mains being determined upon before
the work was commenced, thus securing
permanency when completed. I question
whether so much has ever been accomplished
before in any American city for the same exÂ­
penditure. The Government having large
reservations in the city and the nation at
large having an interest in their capital, I
recommend a liberal policy towards the DisÂ­
trict of Colulbia, and that the Government
should bear its just share of the expense of
these improvements. Every c:tizen visiting
the c.lpital feels a pride in its growing beauty
andthat he, too, is part owner in the inÂ­
vestments made here. I would suggest to
Congress the propriety of promoting the esÂ­
tablishment in the District of an institution
of learntng, or university of the highest class,
by the donation of lanud. There is no place
better suited for such all institution than the
national Capitol: there is no other place in
whlch every citizen is so directly interested.
CIVIL. SEItYCE IlEFOSIY.
In three successive messages to Cougress, I have
clled aittenltin to the sub,eet of ""Civil Service
tseforln "" a cton lis been taken so far as to auÂ­
tOriiLzethe appolllntlsnt o i board to de.,so rules
governing methods of making aplpointmI nts and
prrmotions, but there never has been any actlon
maklng these rules binding, or tvcl entitled to obÂ­
ecrvance, where persons destre the appoLntment of
a friend or the rem.,va or an oflicial who may be
disagree able to them To have any rules effective
they must have the acluiesenee of Congress, as
wel tas of the Executive. I recosimmend, therefore,
the rubject to your attention and suggest that a
special coami, tee of Congress might confer with
the Civil Sets ice Board during toe present session
for tli purl, so ol devising ouch rules as can be
m slnt.idne ansId which will secure the services of
honest andrl capable oilitals, and which will also
protect them mn degree of independece while in
oltice. e'roper rules will protect Congress as well as
the Execuive irom much needless persecution and
will prov of great value to tue public at large.
THiE ADMISSION OF COLORADO.
I recommend for your favorable consideraÂ­
tian the passage of an enabling act for the
admittance of Colorado as a State in the
Uuion. It possessed all the elements of a
prosperous State, agricultural and mineral,
and I believe has a population to justify such
admission.
AN Iti I(;IATIN7 ; VAL,
[In connection with that I would also recommend
the encouragement of a canal for the purpose of irrlÂ­
gation, from the ea-tern slope of the Rocky MounÂ­
tains to the Missouri river. As a ruto I amn opposed
to a further donation of public lands for internal
impro'ueonts owned and controlled by private corÂ­
porations, but lt thltinstance I would make an exÂ­
cpltion. Between the Missouri river and the Stocky
Mlountains, there i11an arid belt of public land, from
th ee hundred to live hundred miles in width, perÂ­
fectly untie for thel occupatin of man for want of
stllicient rain to secure the growth of any products.
Il irrigating, a canal would make a proÂ­
ductive belt as wide as the supply of water
could be made to spread over, across this
entire country, and would secure a cordon of
settlements connecting the present populaÂ­
ti;,, ,.f thi mnotntain and mining regions
with that of the older States. All the land
reclaimed would be clear gain if alternate
sections are retained by the Government. I
would suggest that the retained sections be
tnrown open to entry under the homestead
laws or sold to actual settlers for a very low
price.
GENEEAL AMh ESTY.
I renew my previous recommendation to
Congress for general amnesty. The number
engaged in the late rebellion yet laboring
under disabilities is vera small, but enough to
keep up a constant irritation. No possible
dang;er can accrue to the government by reÂ­
storsg them to eligibilhty to hold office.
CIVIL 5IGITS.
I suggest for your consideration the enactÂ­
ment of a law to better secure the civil rights
which freedomn should secure but has not efÂ­
tually secured to the enfranchised slaves.

PROTOCOL.
I'l:OTOCOL of the Conference held at the DeÂ­
partment of State at Washington, on the


2iith of November, 157i , between Ilamilton
Fish, Secretary of State, and Rear Admiral
Don Jose Polo d!e Barnabe, Envoy ExtraÂ­
ordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of
Spain:Â­
The undersigned, having met for the purÂ­
pose of entering into a definitive agreement
respecting the case of the steamer Virginius,
which while under Inotel the flag of the
United States, was, on the 31st day of OctoÂ­
ber last, captured on the high seas by the
Spanish man-of-war Tornado, have reached
the following conclusions:Â­
SPAIN, on her part, stipulates to restore
forthwith the vessel referred to and the surÂ­
vovors of her passengers, and crew, and on
the 25th day of December next, to salute the
- flag of the United States.
Ir, however. before that date, Spain should prove
to the satlstaction of the government of the Undted
Statee, that the Virginia was not entitled to carry
the flag of the United S ates, and was carrying it at
the time of her captulr without rieht and improperly
the salute will be spontaneously lispensed with, as
in sulch ca e not being necessarily requrable; but
the United States will expect in surui caSe a deÂ­
claimer of intent of indigait to the tilg in the act
which was committed
Furthermore, if on or before the 15th of
December, 1873, it shall be made to appear
to the satisfaction of the United States that
the Virginius did not rightfully carry the
American flag, and was not entitled to
American papers, the United States will inÂ­
stitute an enquiry and adopt legal proceedÂ­
ings against the vessel, if it be found that
she has violated any law of the United States,
and against any of the persons who may
appear to have been guilty of illegal acts in
connection therewith; it being understood
that Spain will proceed according to the
second proposition made to Gen. Sickles, and
communicated in his telegram read to AdÂ­
miral Polo on the 27th inst., to investigate
the conduct of those of her authorities who
have infringed Spanish law or treaty obligaÂ­
tions, and will arraign them before compeÂ­
tent courts and inflict punishment on those
who may have offended-their reciprocral
reclamations to be the subject of consideraÂ­
tion and arrangement between the two govÂ­
ernments, and in case of no agreement, to be
the subject of arbitration, if the constitutionÂ­
al assent of the Senate of the United States
be given thereto.
It is further stipulated that the time, manÂ­
ner and place for the surrender of the Viginius
and the survivors of those who were on board
of her at the time of her capture, and also
the time manner and place for the salute to
the flag of the United States, if there $hould
be occasion for such salute, and shall be subÂ­
ject to arrangement between the undersigned
within the next two days.

A GOOD HORSE.

The Graphic Description by a New York
Dealer.
[Scribner's Monthly.]
""I can't explain what a real good horse
is,"" said one of the best-natured dealers
in the street. They are as different as
men in buying a horse, you must look
first to his head and eyes for signs of inÂ­
telligence, temper, courage and honesty.
Unless a horse has brains you can't teach
him anything any more than you can a
half-witted child. Sec that tall bay
there, a fine-looking animal fifteen hands
high. You can't teach that horse anything.
Why? Well I'll show you a difference in
heads but have a care of his heels. Look
at the brute's headâ€”that rounding nose,
that tapering forehead, that broad full
place below the eyes. Yo can't trust
him. Kick? Well I guess so! Put him
in a ten-acre lot, where he's got plenty of
wing, aud he'll kick the horn off the
moon.""

The world's treatment of man and
beast has the tendency to enlarge and inÂ­
tensify bad qualities, if they predominate.
This good-natured phrenologist could
not refrain from slapping in the face the
horse whose character had been so cruelly
dilineated, while he had but the gentlest
treatment for a sleek-limbed sorrel that
pricked her cars forward and looked inÂ­
telligent enough to understand all that
was being said.
""That's an awful good mare,"" he addÂ­
ed. ""She's as true as the sun. You can see
breadth and fullness between the ears and
and eyes. You can't hire that mare to
act mean or hurtanbody. The eye should
be full, and hazel is a good color. I like
a small, thin ear, and want a horse to
throw his ears well forward. Look out
tor the brute that wants to listen to all
the conversation going on behind him.
The horse that turns back his ears till
they almost meet at the points, take my
word for it, is sure to do something wrong.
See that straight elegant face. A horse
with a dashing face is cowardly, and a
cowardly brute is usually vicious. Then
I like a square muzzle with large nosÂ­
trils, to let in plenty of air to the lungs.
For the underside oi a head a good horse
should be well cut under the jowl, with
jaw-bones broad and wide apart under
the throttle.
""So much for the head,"" he continued.
""The next thing to consider is the build
of the animal. Never buy a long legged
stilty horse. Let him have short,
straight back and a straight rump, and
you've got a gentleman's horse. The
withers should be high, and the shoulders
well set back and broad, but don't get
them too deep in the chest. The foreÂ­
legs should be short. Give me a pretty,
Straight, hind-leg with the hoek low
down, short postern joints, and a round,
mulish foot. There arc all kinds of horsÂ­
es, but the animal that has these points
is almost sure to be slightly graceful,
good-natured aud serviceable."" A to
color, tastes differ. Bays, browns and
chestnuts arc the best. Roans are very
fashionable at present. A great many
gray and sorrels are bought here for
shipment to Mexico and Cuba. They do
well in a hot climate under a tropical
sun, for the same reason that you find
light-colored clothing most serviceable in
summer. That circus horse behind you
is what many people call a calico horse
now, I call him a genuine piebald. It's
a freak of nature and may happen anyÂ­
where.""

by would probably bring about specie payÂ­
they ments more speedily than any legislaÂ­
t the tion looking to the redemption of the
Ltion,
legal tenders in coin; but it would be at
1
the the expense of honor. The legal tenders
icate would have no value beyond settling
their
present liabilities, or, properly speaking,
latuÂ­
repudiating them. They would buy
time nothing after our debts were all settled.
adÂ­ There are a few measures which seem
reÂ­ to me important in this connection, and
com.
which I commend to your earnest conÂ­
such sideration.
purÂ­ First-A repeal of so much of the
Legal Tender act as makes these notes
.g at receivable for debts contracted after a
,cur.
date to be fixed in the act itself, say not
a all later than the first of January, 1877.
ncos We should then have quotations at real
I
the values, not fictitious ones. Gold would
citiÂ­ no longer be at a premium, but currency
gred,
at a discount. A healthy reaction
eans would set in at once, and with it a desire
Lt
by to make the currency equal to what it
n be purports to be. The merchants, manu.
be facturers and tradesmen of every calline,
iploÂ­
could do business on a fair margin of
the profit, the money to be received having
been
an unvarying value. Laborers, and all
vent classes who work for stipulated pay or
atuÂ­ salary, would receive. more for their inÂ­
eate come, because extra profits would no
has longer be charged by the capitalist to
compensate for the risks of a downward
I
of fluctuation in the value of currency.
snot
Second-That the Secretary of the
efÂ­ Treasury be authorized to redeem, say
Ie
a not less than $2,000,000 monthly of legal
catÂ­ tender notes, by issuing in their stead a
ntly
long bond, bearing interest at the rate of
Sties
3 65-100 per cent. per annum, of denomÂ­
inations ranging from $50 to $1,000 each.
This would in time reduce the legal tenÂ­
the der notes to a volume that could be kept
bion
afloat without demanding redemption in
was large sums suddenly.
;paÂ­
Third-That additional nower be given
ntal
to the Secretary of the Treasury to accuÂ­
tual
mulate gold for final redemption, either
by increasing the revenue, curtailing exÂ­
exÂ­ penses, or both. It is preferable to do
Sent
both, and I recommend that a reduction
any of the expenditure be made, wherever it
roÂ­ can be done without impairing the GovÂ­
cesÂ­
ernment's obligations or crippling the
the due execution thereof.
ons One measure for increasing the reveÂ­
out nue and the only one I think of is the
acÂ­ restoration, of the duty on tea and coffee.
The duties would add probably $18,000,Â­
ion 000 to the present amount received from
the imports, and would in no way increase
or the prices paid for these articles by the
itiÂ­ consumers. These articles are the
but products of countries collecting revenue
any
from exports, and as we, the largest conÂ­
ton, sumers, reduce the duties, they proporÂ­
nit
tionally increase them. With this
Sbe
addition to the revenue many duties now
and
collected and which give but an
Lich
insignificant return for the cost of colÂ­
1
to lection might be remitted, and to the diÂ­
no rect advantages of consumers at home.
ray I would mention those articles which enÂ­
ter into the manufaitures of all sorts.
ns, All duty paid upon such articles goes diÂ­
ave rectly to the cost of the articles when
ave manufactured here, and must be paid for
acÂ­ by the consumers. These duties not only
ent come from the consumers at home, but
!viÂ­
act as a protection to foreign manufac.
the
turers of the same completed articles in
lisÂ­ our own and distant markets.
ere I will suggest or mention another subÂ­
bey
ject bearing upon the problem of ""How
pon to enable the Secretary of the Treasury
ent to accumulate balances."" It is to devise
ns. some other method of verifying claims
ens against the Government than at present
LesÂ­
exists, through the Court of Claims, esÂ­
arÂ­ pecially those claims growing out of the
riaÂ­
late war. Nothing is more certain than
of that a very large per cent. of the amounts
passed and paid are either wholly fraudÂ­
ulent or are far in excess of the real lossÂ­
teÂ­ es sustained. The large amount of losses
of proven, on good testimony, according to
orÂ­ existing laws, by affidavitsof fictitious or
bat
unscrupulous persons, to have been sueÂ­
of tained
. on small farms and plantations,
ad, are not only far beyond the possible yield
uÂ­ of those places for any one year, but, as
ges
every one knows who has had experience
orÂ­ in tilling the soil, and who has visited
abÂ­ the scenes of these spoliations, are in
onÂ­
many instances more than the individual
nts claimants were ever worth, including
the
their personal and real estate.
to The report of the Attorney General,
on which will be submitted to Congress at
ore
an early day, will contain a detailed hisÂ­
tory of awards made and of claims
pending of the class here referred to.
ng THE WARB DEPARTHbENT.
as The report of the Secretary of War,
iat
accompanying this message, gives a deÂ­
ace
taied account of army operations for the
of year just passed, expenses for mainten.
Iat
ance, etc, vith recommendations for leg.
ud islation, to which I respectfully invite
your attention. To some of these I. in.


he First-The necessity of making $300,Â­
isÂ­ 000 of the appropriation for the sub.
30,
sistence of the department available beÂ­
nd fore the beginning of the next fiscal year.
T5,
Without :this provision, troops at points
se distant from supply production must
34. either go without food, or existing laws
or must be violated. It is not attended
re with cost to the Treasury.
1g
Second-His recommendation for the
in
enactment of a system of annuities for
the families of deceased officers, by volÂ­
isÂ­ untary deductions from the monthly pay
at
of officers. This again is not attended
nÂ­
with burden upon the Treasury, and
aÂ­ would, for the future, relieve much dis.
nÂ­
tress which every old army officer has
if witnessed in the past, of officers dying
yÂ­
suddenly or beingkilled, leaving families
sk
without even the means of reaching their
he
friends, if fortunate enough to have
mw friends to aid them.
Third-The repeal of the law abolish.
ing mileage and a return to the old sys.
n tem. iy
Fourth-The trial with torpedoes, un.
aÂ­ der the corps of engineers, and appropriÂ­
Le
ations for the same. Should war ever
n, occur between the United States and any
rn maritime power,torpedoes will be among,
)""
if not the most effective and cheapest
sÂ­
auxiliary for the defense of harbors, and
an also in aggressive operations, that we
can have. Hence it is advisable to learn
n by experiment their best construction
cÂ­
and application as well as effect.
2Â­
Fifth-A permanent organization of
iÂ­ the Signal Service Corps. This service
1Â­
has now become a necessity of peace as
id well as war, under the advancement by
)t the present able management.
te
Sixth-A renewal of the appropriaÂ­
tion for compiling the official records of
s the war, etc. !t

machinery thoroughly repaired; so that vall
they are now in the most efficient condiÂ­ the

most powerful of our ships for fighting less

complete repairs and could be ready for tur

considerable repairs to their boilers and req

This constitutes a fleet of more than pre

The navy has been brought to this conÂ­ pro

cation of what could be spared from the
current appropriations of the last few ant
years, and from that made to meet the tur
aossible emergency of two years ago. It ish:
has been done quietly, without proclaÂ­ gre
mation or display, and though it has neÂ­
cessarily straightened the department in
its ordinary expenditure, and, as far as dia
the ironclads are concerned, has added firs
nothing to the cruising force of the navy, ant

THE POSTOFFICE DEPARTENT. sou
.The report of the Postmaster General, tiel
herewith transmitted, gives a full history pra
of the workings of the department for tor;
he year just past. It will be observed nat
that the deficiency to be supplied from a v
the general treasury is increased over ion
the amount required for the preceding cha
year. In a country so vast in area as taii
the United States, with large portions qui
c.arsely settled, it must be expected that to
this important service will be more are
or less a burden upon the treasury for of 1
muny years to come; but there is no ciel
branch of the public service which interÂ­ the
ests the whole people more than that of to 1
cheap and rapid transmission of the mails the
to every inhabited part of our territory. of
Iext to the free school the postoffice is tieo
the great educator of the people,Â­ and it con
may well receive the support of the GenÂ­ Z
eral Government. The subsidy of $150,Â­ ex. c

THE BLACK HILLS, is
The discovery of gold in the Black me
Hills,-aportion of the Sioux reservation,
has had the effect to induce a large emiÂ­ 1
gration of miners to that point. Thus. Ed
far the effort to protect the treaty rights of I
of the Indians to that section has been gri
successful; but the next year will cerÂ­ ter
tainly witness a large increase of such
emigration. The negotiations for thereÂ­
linquishment of the gold fields having ha
failed, it will be necessary for Congress Co
to adopt some measures to relieve the
an
embarrassment growing out of the causes tic
tamed. The Secretary of the Interior ut
3uggests that the supplies now approÂ­ lal

being no longer obligatory under the Ch

INDIAN TERRITORY. na
The condition of the Indian Territory, to
to wfieh I have referred in several of my tit
formereannual messages, remains practiÂ­ ch
cally unchanged. of
The Secretary of the interior has taken br
measures to obtain a full report of the bE
condition of that territory and will make
it.the subject of a special report at an
e~ary day. It may then be necessary to at
make some further recommendation in pc
regard-to legislation for the government of
o? that territory. bi
THE PATENT OFFICE. b
The steady growth and increase of the
business of the Patent Office indicates, in
nome measure, the progress of the indusÂ­ tc
-rils-aetivity of the country. The receipts d
of the office are in excess of its expendiÂ­ tl
Stiyres, and the office generally is in a p
prosperous and satisfactory condition. p
TEE LAND OFFICE. V
The report of the General Land Office a
shows that there were 2,459,601 acres t
lessdisposed of during this than during o
the last year. More taan one-half of this v
-decrease was in lands disposed of under 1
the homestead and timber culture laws. t
The cause of this decrease is supposed to c
be found in the grasshopper scourge and e
the drouths which prevailed so extensiveÂ­ E
?y in some of the frontier States and i
Territories during that time as to disÂ­ I
courage and deter entries by actual setÂ­
tiere. The cash receipts were less by i
""6'x0;322 23 than during the preceding i
-ear.
The entire surveyed area of the public
domain is 680,253,094 acres, of which
26,077,531 acres were surveyed during
the past year, leaving 1,154,471,762 acres
still unsurveyed.
The report of the commissioner preÂ­
sents many interesting suggestions in reÂ­
- gard to the management and disposition
""'of the public domain and the modificaÂ­
-tion ofexisting laws,""'the apparent imÂ­
' -portance of which should insure for them
the careful consideration of Congress.
PENSIONS.
The number of pensioners still continÂ­
ues to decrease, the highest number hayÂ­
ing been reached during the year ending
June 30,1875. During the last year 11,Â­
557 names were added 'to the rolls and
12,977 were dropped therefrom, showing.
Iseteocrceao e of 1,420. 'But while the

 number of pensioners has decreased, the sion'
annual amount due on the pension rolls next
has increased $44,733 13. This is caused laws
by the greatly increased average rate of the 1
1
pensions which, by the liberal legislation the
r
of Congress, has increased from $90 26 so I
1
in 1872 to $103 91 in 1875. To each inÂ­ sure
t valid pensioner there is an increase in desc
the average rate of fifteen per cent. in the nor
three years. During theyear ending June vide
30, 1875,'there was paid on account of actu
pensions, including the expenses of disÂ­
e bursements, $29,683,116, being $910,632 K
less than was paid the preceding year. whic
This reduction in the amount of expendiÂ­ mitt
tures was produced by the decrease in is cI
o the amount of arrearages due on allowed the
claims, and on pensions the rate of which port
was increased by the legislation of the and
preceding session of Congress. At the Fi
close of the last fiscal year there were on to a
,t
the pension rolls 234,821 persons, of mor
whom 210,363 were army pensioners, witl
f 105,478 being invalids, and 104,885 S'
widows and dependent relatives; 3,420 be
e were navy pensioners, of whom 1,636 who
were invalids, and 1,784 widows and deÂ­ by
r pendent relatives; 21,038 were pensionÂ­ any
ers of the war of 1812, 15,875 of whom pub
were survivors, and 5,163 were widows. Ihc
d It is estimated that $29,535,000 will be vott
d
required for the payment of pensions for non
y
the next fiscal year-an amount which is cy,
$963,000 less than the estimate for the am(
present year. T

' .':?Iowdays the fiscal `policy is always. a prominent plank in the'platform of every politician, yet is it a wise policy on the part of the consumers to place'a tax on the articles which they do not make; but only consume ? Suppose, for instance, the customs duty. is 33 per cent. on imported goods, the wages of the laborer in all grades of employment in country thus protected, should be 33 per cent. higher than in a ""freotrado country, to make things equal-but, is it ever the case? True protection,. like charity, begins at home, and in these days when the air is laden with microbes, bacteria and other germs of disease, it behoves as all to he on guard against the common enemyr; old age kills but few, disecos slays its thousands and millions. and all because mankind is so apathetic and careless about first signs of approaching sickness. Neuralgia is one of the most positive signs of the approach of some physical affliction, and requires immediate attention before it has progressed beyond human aid, and tatal disease has got hold of some vital organ. S. C. Reilly, Esq., writes, under date June let, 1891, I?om e;arner's Avenue, ifarrickville, N.S.V.: .""I can, with confidence bear testimony to tbo wonderful curative powers of Cle-nents Tonic. For years I have been periodicallyattacked and a great sufferer from neurslcia and general debility and anyone who has ever been afflicted with such nervous misery can form an idea of what I have satfered. I had also chronic indigestion, general languid feelings, and an utter dislike to exert myself. The neuralgia was so severe that I have' paced the hall all glht, and the agony was so excruoiating that I was almost out of my mind. I tried all se-called remedies, also galTanic treatment, which did no good. At last a friend recommended Clements Tonic, and I was so miserable and disheartened that I purchased a small bottle, and after the second dose felt great relief. I continued it a use, and am thankful to say that after twenty-four hours the pain had disappeared, and I was free from the nerrous terror. I continued Cloments Tonic and have taken four bottles; all my laugour is gone, I am free from indigo:tion I can do a day's work with any man, and oat like a horse; and have great pleasure in recommending Cleastets Tonic to anyone suffering from nervous complaints.-Yours trly, S.

Th- Hon. T. C. Cat chines:
My Dear SIB Since the cocver-ation I had
with yon ami Mr. dark, of Alabama, a tew
days ao In recard to my action moti the tariff
bill new before me. 1 have itivn the subnet
further and most seri.ms consi ieratioa. The
result is t am more settle l than ever in the
determination to allow the bill to become a
la uitbout my sitrnctiire.
When the formulation of legislation which
it was hoped would embody Democratic ideas
of t.irit! reform was lately entered upon !y
the Coasxess notbias whs further from taf anÂ­
ticipation than a result which I could not
promptly and entbna tasticallr iu-iorse.
It is therefore with s feeUnn of the ntmost
ohsappolntment that I submit to a denial of
thi- privilege.
I do not claim to be better than the masses
f ray patty nor do 1 wish to avoid any ieÂ­
spOBidbility wliii !: on account ef the paasace
of ;lds la sf 1 ought to beat as a member of the
Democratic onranixaiion. neither will i perÂ­
mit myself to be separated fro-u my party to
such an extent :is might be implied by my veto
of tariff teirlaiation which, thoozh dtsapÂ­
pointitii. is still chareeat-le to DemoÂ­
cratic effort. Ha: there are provisions
In tins bill which are not ir line with honest
tantt reform, an l it co tains inconsistencies
cr.d crudities which aught not to PI ear in tarÂ­
it; laws or law of any kind. Besides t! ere
were as von rnd 1 wed know, incidents ac-
awnpaartoa the pnrsagc of tho bill through

Conirress wnich made every rincf re rettrmer
unhappy, wtile influences surrounded it in its
latter stages and interfered with its final conÂ­
struction which ought not to be recognized or
tolerated in Democratic tariff reform councils.
And yet, notwithstanding all its vicissitudes
and all xic bad treatment it received at the
hands of pretended frienils. it presents a vast
improvement to existing conditions. It will
certainly lighten many tariff burdens that n'iw
rest heavily upon the people. It is not only a
barrier agains; the tc-turn of rnad protection,
but it furnishes a vantage grooad from which
must be wad turther aresHive operations
against protected monopoly and government a!
favoritism.
I take my place with tic rank ard rile of the
Pe::;ocia tc larty who believe in tariff reÂ­
form and who i.now what it is; who lefuse to
accept the results embodied in this bill as the
dose of the war: who are not blinded to the
fact that the If very of Hen ocratic tariff reÂ­
form has been stolen and worn in the service
of Republican protection, and who have
marked the places where the deadly blight of
treason has blasted the councils of the brave
in their hen ' of n.ight.
'1 he trusts and combinat on the commnnÂ­
ism of pelf-whose machinations have preÂ­
vented us from reaching the success we deÂ­
serve. s'.:ould not be foncotten or forgiven. We
shad recover from our astonishment at their
exhibition of power, and it then the Question
is forced upon us whether tiiey shall submit
to the free legislative will of the people's repÂ­
resentatives or shall dict'ite the laws which
the people inust obey, wc will accept and
settle that issue as one involving the integÂ­
rity and safety of American institutions.
I love the principles of true Democracv beÂ­
cause they are founded in patriotism and upÂ­
on justice and fairness to ard all interests. I
am proud ot'niy party organiz tion because
it is conservatively stdf- and persistent in
the enforcement of ite. principles. Therefore
1 do not despair of the efforts made by the
House of Represent ltives to supplement the
bill already passed by furtht r legislation and
to have engrafted upon it such modifications
as will more nearly meet Democratic hopes
ami aspirations.
1 can't be mistaken as to the necessity of
free raw materials as the foundation of logical
anil sensible tar.ff reform. The extent to
which this is recognized in the legislat.on alÂ­
ready secured is one of its encouraging and
redeeming features, but it is vexatious to reÂ­
call that while free coal and ir.n ore have been
denied, a letter of the Secretary of the TreasÂ­
ury discloses the fact that both might have
been niude fiee by the annual surrender of
only about $7uo.00 of unnecessary revenue.
I am sure that there is a common habit of
underestimating the importance of free raw
materials in tariff legislation, and of regardÂ­
ing them as only related to concessions to he
made to our manufacturers. The truth is. their
influence is so far-reaching that, it disregardÂ­
ed, a complete and beneficent scheme of tmiff
reform cannot be successfully inaugurated
When we give to our manufacturers free raw
materials we unshackle American enterprise
and ingenuity, and these will open tin; doors
of foreign markets to the reception of our
wares and give opportunity for the continuÂ­
ous and remunerative employment of AmeriÂ­
can labor.
With materials cheapened by their freedom
from tariff charges the cost of their product
must be orrespondingly cheapened. ThereÂ­
upon justice and fairness to the consumer
would demand t hat the manufacturers be obÂ­
liged to submit to such a readjustment and
n.odification of the tariff upon their finished
goods as would secure to the people the beneÂ­
fit of the reduced cost of their manufacture
and shield the consu ner against the exactions
of inordinate profits.
It will thus be seen that free raw materials
ami a just and fearless regulation and reducÂ­
tion of the tariff to meet the changed condiÂ­
tions would carry to every humble home in
the laud the blessings of increased comfort
and cheaper living.
The millions of our countrymen who have
fought bravely and well for tariff reform
should be exhorted to continue the struggle,
boldly challenging to open warfare and conÂ­
stantly uuai diug against treachery aud halfÂ­
heartedness in their camp.
Tariff reform will not be settled until it Is
honestly and fairlv settled in the interest and
to the benefit of a patient, and long-suffering
people. Yours very truly.
Gbovee Cleveland.

The department at 10 o'clock, after the

were still at work behind closed doors.
Shortly before noon Secretary Long left
the navy department for the White House,
carrying with him Dewey's second disÂ­
patch.
The Second Dispatch.
After leaving the president, Secretary
Long made public the dispatch, as folÂ­
lows: -
""Cavlte, May 4.-I have taken possesÂ­

As the last word from the dispatch was
uttered, several of the onlookers called
for three cheers for. Dewey. They were
given with a will, and the usual serenity
of the navy department was broken by a
round of cheers which fairly shook the
building.
It is said at the navy department that
Dewey himself cut the Manila cable, and
that the bay and everything else is comÂ­

"440","479767","THE PRESIDENT'S KANSAS MIESSAGE.





We have laid aside a large portion of the matter
which had been prepared for our editorial columns toÂ­
day to give place to this very important and anxiously
expected document. It was received at an hour too
late to admit of lengthy comment. But this it does not
require. It emphatically speaks for itself. Every word
has its meaning. Every line is an argument. A more
complete and cogent appeal for the admission of KanÂ­
sas as a State into the Union-a more crushing expoÂ­
sure of the shallow sophistry and insufficient reasons
urged against that just, proper and constitutional measÂ­
ure-could not have been presented to Congress nor been
addressed to the patriotic spirit and sober judgment of
the country. The President shows that the ConstituÂ­
tion under which Kansas seeks admission was regularly
and legally framed in full accordance with the letter,
spirit and intent of the Kansas-Nebraska act-he shows
that the law-abiding people of Kansas have, under the
authority vested in them by the act, progressed regularÂ­
ly from one step to anotheruntil they have assumed the
attributes which belong to a sovereign people-that
they themselves have ordained the existence of slavery
which had been carried thither, and protected by the
Constitution of the United States-and that the entire
responsibility for the troubles of the territory and the
perils to which they have brought the whole country
rests upon the Topekaites, or Freesoilers who have defiÂ­
antly placed themselves in an attitude of outlawry toÂ­
wards their own government.
How any man not lost to reason-not groping in the
utter darkness of treason and of sectional fanaticismÂ­
can resist the conclusions to which the President arrives,
we are at a loss to determine. And yet that his policy
is in imminent danger of defeat is but too evident. It
is a sad truth that the vile spirit which has impelled
Lane and his co-robels, to treason, in Kansas, predomiÂ­
nates in the Northern councils and finds randy utterance
and practical demonstration in the halls of Congress.Â­
Should those who are thus plotting the ruin and dishonÂ­
or of the slave-holding States succeed in rejecting KanÂ­
sas because of her pro-slavery Constitution contrary to
the earuest and patriotic remonstrance of the AdminisÂ­
tration, and the eloquent and solemn warning of
Southern Representatives, it becomes a question of
practical and serious import to what measures of remeÂ­
dy, redress and self-protection shall the outraged parties
resort?
MESSAGE.
To tae &nate and House of llepresentaticee of the 'nited
Kai'tee :
I hove received from .1 Callhoun. E.q.. President of
the late sConstiutiounl ConvenLoun of Klaonto, a copy,
duy c-rutmed by hbuself, ,of the Coun-ttatiou rained by
that Ltody, with the expression of a hipe that I wouim
submit the same to the cotsideratien of Congreas,
""with the view of the admission of IKnets into the
ITnu as an independent dtate."" j1 cnmplianee with
this request, I herewith transmit to I.oongress, for their
action, the Constitution of K unsas, with the ordinance
respcain4 the publice lands, as well as the ltteor ot Mlr
Calihotn, dated at Lecompton on the 14th ultimo, by
which they were aescomtpanied. Having received but a
single copy of tile Constitution and ordinance, I aend
this to the Senate.
A great delusion seems to pervade the public mind in
rel.t on to the condition of parties in Kaness. 'Ihis
arises tront the difficulty of inducing the Amerivac:
people to realize the fact that any portion of thent
should be in a state of rebellion agaiust tihe government
under which they live. When we speak it the atyans
of Kansas, we are apt to refer merely to the existence
of two violent political parties in that Territory, divided
on the question of slavery, just as we speak of Sueh
parties to the States. This presents no adequate idea
of the true state of the ease. The dividing line there
is not between two political parties, both acknowledging
the lawsul existence of the government, but between
those who are loyal to this government and those who
have endeavored to destroy its existence by force and
by usurpation-between those who sustain and those
who have done all in their power to overthlrow ite Ter
ritorial Government established by Congress. This
government they would long aince have subverted had
it not been protected from their assu ts by the troops of
the United States. Such bhas been the condition of af
fairs since my inauguration. Ever since that period a
large portion of the people of Kansas have been in a
state of rebellion against the Government, with a milhÂ­
tary leader at their head of a most turbulent and danÂ­
gerous character. They have new r acknowledged, but
have constantly renounced and defied the Government i
to which they owe allegiance, and have been all the
time in a state of resistance ogainst its authority. They
have all the time been endeavoring to subvert it and to
establish a revolutionary government, under the so
called Topeka Constitution, in its stead.
Even at this very moment the Topeka Legislature
are in session. Whoever has read the correspondence
of Governor Walker with the State Iepartment, reÂ­
cently communicated to the Senate, will be convinced
that this picture is not overdrawn. He always protesÂ­
ted against the withdrawal of any portion of the mili
tary force of the United States from the Territory,
deeming its prtsence absolutely necessary for the presÂ­
ervation of the regular government and the execution
of the laws. In his very first dispatch to the SecretaÂ­
ry of State, dated June 2, 1857, he says: ""The most
alarming movement, however, proceeds from the asÂ­
sembling on the 9th June of the so-called Topeka LegÂ­
islature, with a view to the enactment of an entire code
of laws. Of course, it will be my endeavor to prevent
such a result, as it would lead to inevihable and disas.
trous collision, and, in fact, renew the civil war in KanÂ­
sas."" This was with difficulty prevented by the effoltti t
of Governor Walker; but soon thereafter, on the 15th
of July, we find him requesting General liarney ti,
furnish hinm a regiment of dragoonse to proceed to thb
city of Lawrence-and tie for the reason that he had




 received authentic iotelligonce, veritid by his own acÂ­ tic
tual obeervation, that a dangerous rebellion had occur (h
red, ""involving an open defiance of the laws and the th
eat:ablishoment of an insurgent government in that eli
city."" go
In the Governor's dispatch of July 15th, he informs pr
the Secreta'y of State 'that this movement at LaewÂ­ so
reoue was .ho beginning of a plan, originating in that dt
city, to organize insurrection throubhout the Territory; w
and especially in all towns, cit es or counties where the fry
Republican party have a majority. Lawrence is the th
hot-bed of all the Abolition movements in this TerritoÂ­ at
ry. It is the town established by the Abolition sonicÂ­ at
ties of the East, and whiie there are respectable people b1
there, it is filled by a considerable number of mercenaÂ­ al
ries who are paid by Abolition societies to perpetuate vi
and diffuse agitation throughout Kansas, and prevent in
a peaceful settlement of this question. Hiwing failed e
to induce their own so called Topeka State Legislature
to organizo this insurrection, Lawrence has commenced if
itself and, if not arrested, the rebjllion will extend et
throughout the Territory."" d
And again : ""In order to send this communication p
immediately by mail, I must close, assuring you that I
the spirit of rebelFoa pervades the great mnass of the n
Republican party of this Territory, instigated, as I enÂ­ ii
tertain no doubt they are, by Eastern societies, having h
in view results most disastrous to the Government and h
to the Union ; and that the continued presence of GenÂ­ ri
eral Harney here is indispensable, as originally stipulaÂ­
ted by me, with a large body of dragoons and several e
batteries.""'
On the 211th July, 1857, Gen. Lane, under the auÂ­ e
Ithoritv of the Topeka coast ution, undertook, as GovÂ­ i
ernor Walker informs us, ""to organize the whole soÂ­ C
called Free State party into volunteers, and to tak""e
names of all whits refuse enrollment. The professed ohbÂ­
ije,t is to orotect the polls, at the electon ia August, of n
1
the new in-urgent Topeka State Legislature.""
'The obj-et of taking the names of ill who refuse
st rlm, nt is to terrify the free 8tate conservatives into C
Isbmission. This is proved by the recent atrocitieÂ­
committed on suet men by Topsk.aites. The spe-dy
bIcailon of large bodies of regular troops here, w.b
tw'. batteries, is necessary The Lewrence insurgento
awrit the development of this new rev.lutionary m:li
tare orern:nvtion."" &c.. &e.
tn the Governor's diepatch of J.uly 17th, he says
that ""G-n Lane and his staffeverywhere deny the nuÂ­
thoritl of the Territorial laws, and counsel a total disÂ­
regard of these enactments.""
Wi hout makint further quotations ot a similar charÂ­ t
- aster from other dispatehes of Gov. Walker it appears r
by a referenÂµe to Mr. S!anton's ommlunieatio to Gen
Cass, ,f the 9th I)ecember last, that the ""important
step of calling the regislature together was taken after
1 I (he) had beco:me ost:-ied that the election ordered bh
the convention on the 21lt inst. could not be conducted
without collision and bloodlshed "" St intense was the
i distÂ·al feeling among the enemies of the GovernmeonL
established by Congress, that an election which affo dÂ­ I
,ed them an opportunity, if in the majority, of makitl
Kansas a free State, accordina to their profevs A deÂ­
sire. could not be. conducted without collision and bloodÂ­
shoed
The truth is, that, up till tihe present moment, the
enemies of the existing Governmnt still adhere to
their Topeka [evolutionary Constitution and Govern
t ment. The very first paragraph of the messagne of
Gov. Robinson, dated on the 7th December, to the
Topeka Legislatoro now assembled at Lawrence, conÂ­
tales an op n defiance of the Constitution and laws of I
the Uni'ed Sates. The Governor says: ""The Co.Â­ I
vent:on which framonted the Constitution at Topvka origÂ­ t
intted with thei people of Kansas Territory. Thes
- t ave ,dopted a-sv ratified the same twice by adirect
vote, and also indirectly through two clectious of State
officers and members of the State Legislature. Yet it
'f has pleas, d the Administration to regard the whole
proceeding revolutionary.""
Y This Topcka government, adhered to with such
r, treasonable pertinacity, is a government in direct opÂ­
Sposlilon to the existing government prescribed and reÂ­
ea:rizel by Congreos. It is a usurpation of the same
charanet r as it would be for a portion of the people of
any State of the Union to undertake to establish a sepÂ­
e arate government, within its limits, for the purpose of
t redressine any grievance, real or imaginary, of which
y they mizht ermmlnin, agalat the leitimate State govÂ­
ernment Such a principle, if carried into execution.
-e
a-uld destroy all lawful cathority and produce univerÂ­
sal anarchy.
From this statement of f1,cts, the reason hecomes
y palpable why the enemies of the Government authorÂ­
i ;z-el hy Conuress have refuaed to vote for delegates to
the Kensaw Constitutional Convention, and also afterÂ­
wards on the question of slavery submitted by it to tlhe
e people. It is because they have ever refused to saneÂ­
tion or reerinize any other constitution than that framÂ­
ed at Topeka.
ITd tihe whole Lecompton Constitution been sobÂ­
rY mitted to the people, the adherents of this organization
It w,nld doubtlfss have voted aga:nst it, because, if sueÂ­
!d ce sol, they would thus have removed an obstacle out
- of the way of their own revolutionary Constitution.Â­
.o They would have done this, not upon a consideration
of the merits of the whole or any part of the LecompÂ­
ton Cotnstitution, but simply because they have ever
resisted the authority of the government authorized
aÂ­ by Congress, from which it emanated.
o Snuch being the nnofrtunate condition of affairs in
aÂ­ the Territory, what was thIe right as well as the duty
at -'f the law-abiding people ? Were they silently and
,f patieft'y to submit to the Topeka usurpation, or adopt
the necessary measurs to establish a Constitution unÂ­
eÂ­ der the authority of the organic law of Congress?
c that this law recognized the right of the people of
the Territory, without any enabling ant from Congress,
Sto form a State constitnti-in, is toon clear for argument.
For Congress t. ""leave the p-ople of the Territory
dI prfectly free,"" in framing ti ir constitution, ""to form
and regulate their domestic institutions in their ow-!
r iway, subjct only to the Constitution of the United
Sttatres ;"" and then to say that they shall not be perÂ­
mitted t. prtieedd and form a constitution in their own
Sway, wisthiut an express au'htority from Congress, apÂ­
pears to ne lmost a ontradietion in terms. It would
be mubch more plausiible to cor-tend that Congress had
no power to pass such an enabling not. than to argue
r that the pople of a territory might be kept out
Sof the Uniort for an indefiniteperiod, and until it
,nigiht please Congress to permit them to exercise the
right otf self government. This would be to adopt not
"" heir own way,it but the way which Congress might
i
prescribe.
It ia impossible that any people could have proceedÂ­
in I
ed with nmore regolority in the formation of a ConntiÂ­


i lution than the people of Kaneas have done. It was
Inecessary. first, to ascertain whether it was the desire
, of the people to be relieved from their Territorial deÂ­
t pendence and establish a State Government. For this
uurpoae, the Ter itorial Legislature, in 1855, passed a
e law ""'for taking the sense of the people of this TerritoÂ­
dry upon the expediency of c dling a Convention to
i form a State Conastitatioe"" at the general election to
'a be held in October, 1856. The ""sense of the people""
was accordingly taken, and they decided in favor of a
Convention. It is true, that at this election the eneÂ­
1 mies of the Territorial Government did not vote, beÂ­
.o
cause they were then engaged at Topeka, without the
d slightest pretext or authority, in framing a Constitution
of their own, for the purpose of subverting the TerriÂ­
tori:l Government.
In pursuance of this decision of the people in favor
d
of a convention, the Territorial Legislature, on the
â€¢ 27th day of February, 1857, passed an act for the
election of delegates, on the third Monday of June.
a 1857, to frame a State Uonstitution. This law is as
fair in its provisions as any that ever passed a legislaÂ­
tive body for a similar purpose. The right of suffrage I
Sat this election is clearly and justly defined. ""Every
bona fide inhabitant of the Territory of Kansas,"" on i
t the third Monday of June, the day of election, who I
was a citizen of the United States above the age of 21,
and had resided therein for three months previous to
that date, was entitled to vote. In order to avoid all
interference from neighboring States or Territories 3
with the freedom and fairness of the eleotion, pro. I
vision was made for the registry of the qualified voÂ­ 3
ters; and, in pursuance thereof, nine thousand two I
hundred and fifty-one voters were registered. Gov.
Walker did his who'e duty in urging all the qualified
citizens of Kansas to vote at this election. In his InÂ­
augural Address, on the 27th of May last, he informÂ­
ed them that ""under our practice, the preliminary act I
of framing a State Constitution is uniformly performed
through the instrumentality of a Convention of deleÂ­
gates chosen by the people themselves. That ConvenÂ­ 8
tion is now about to be elected by you under the cell V
of the Territorial Legislature, created and still recogÂ­ 8
nized by the authority of Congress, and clothed by it, fe
in the comprehensive language of the organic law, It
with full power to make such an enactment. 0
The Territorial Legislature, then, in assembling this tl
Convention; were fully sustained by the act of ConÂ­ a
gress, and the authority of the Convention is distinctÂ­ e;
ly recognized in my instructions from the President of Ii
the United States."" fu
The Governocr also clearly and distinctly warns them
what would be the consequence if they should not par. he


ticipatoin thtis leetion, "" The people of Kansas, then,
(he says,) are, epited by the highest nathorityknown to
the Counstitut ,gt to participate, freely and fairly, in the
election of d efegates to frame a Constitution and State
government. The law has performed its entire approÂ­
priate funotic a when it extends to the people the right of
suffrage, bu
t it cannot compel the performance of that
duty. Thro ughout our whole Union, however, and
wherever f1r se government prevails, those who abstain
from the ae erciso of the right of suffrage, authorize
those who ie vote to act for them in that contingency ;
and the absentees are as much bound, under the law
and Consti ution, where there is no fraud or violence,
by the act at the majority of those who do vote, as if
all had participated in the eleetion. Otherwise, as
voting tnmutbe voluntary, self-government would be
impracticable, and monarchy, or despotism would reÂ­
main as the only alternative.""
It may also be observed, that at this period any hope,
if such had existed, that the Topeka Constitution would
ever he recognized by Congress, must have been abanÂ­
doned. Congress had adjourned on the 3d of March
previous, having recognized the legal existence of the
Terr itorial Legislature in a variety of forms which I
need not enumerate. Indeed, the Delegate elected to
the House of Representatives, under a territorial law,
had been admitted to his seat, and had just completed
his term of service on the day previous to my inauguÂ­
ration
This was the propitious moment for settling all diffiÂ­
culties in Kansas. this was the time for abandoning
the rev.olutiiuary Topeka organization, and for the
enemies of the existing government to conform to the
laws, and to unite with ts friends in framing a State
Constitution. But this they refused to do, and the conÂ­
sequences of their refusal to submit to lawful authority
and vote at the election of delegates, may yet prove of a
mi t deplorable character. Would that the respect for
the laws of the land which so eminently distinguished
the men of the past generation could be revived ! It is
i disregard and violation of law which have for years
Kept the Territory of Kansas in a state of almost open
rebellion against its Government. It is the same spirit
which has produced actual rebellion in Utah. Our
only safety ounsi.ts ta obedience and conformity to law.
'ihould a general spirit against its enforcement prevail,
this will prove fatal to us as a nation. We acknowledge
atno master but the law ; and should we out loose from
as restraints, and every one do what seemeth good in
cis own eyes, our case will indeed be hopeless.
The enemies of the Territorial Government deterÂ­
miued still to resist the authority of Congress. They
refused to vote fir delegates to the conventiin not beÂ­ I
cause from sircumstancee which I need not detail, there
.was an omission to register the comparatively few voters
who were inhabitants of certain counties in Kansas in
the early spring of 1857, but because they had prede
ternmmned at all hazards to adhere to their revolutionary
organization, and defeat the esablishbment of any other
Constitution than that which they had framed at ToÂ­
pvlia. The election was, therefore, tufiired to pass by
default; but of this result the quahified electors who
refused to vote, can never justly complain.
From this review, it is manifest that the Lecompton
Convention, according to every principle of coustituÂ­
onal law, was legally constituted, and was invested
with power to frame Coustitution.
The sacred princil,:o of popular sovereignty has been
invoked in favor of the eniemies of law and order in
Kansas. But in what manner is popular sovereignty to
be exercised in this country, if net through the instruÂ­
mentality of eotablish-rd law 1 In certain small te.
publics of ancient time the people did assemble in primaÂ­
ry meet ngs, passed la.vs, and directed public aliaors, la
our cuntry this ismanitiatly irnmoossibl.e, Popular sov
ereiguty can be exercised here only through the ballot
, bx; and if the people will refuse to exercise it in this
t manner, as they have done in Kansas at the election
lthe delegates is not for them to complain that their
rights have been violated.
The Kansas Convention, thus lawfully constituted,
proceeded to frame a Constitution, and having oomÂ­
Spleted their work, finally adjourned on the 7th day of
, November last. They did not think proper to submit
f trie whole of this Coustitution to a popular vote; but
,hey did submit the question whether Kansas should be
if a free or a slave State, to the people. This was the
b questiun which had convulsed the Union and shaken it
to its very centre. 'This was the question which had
lighted up the tlarit:s of civil war in Kansas, and had
produced dangerous sectional parties throughout the
coutedeacy. It was of a character so paramount in
,respect to the condition of Kansas, as to rivet the anxious
attention of the people of the whole country upon it,
Sand t alone. No person thoughtlf any other question.
For my own part, when I instructed Governor Wa!ker,
iv in general terms, in favor of submitting the ConstituÂ­
lion to the people, I had no object in view except the
all.absorbing question of slavery. In what manner the
people of Kanasas might regulate their other concerns,
w ,s not a subject which attracted any attention. In
n fact, the general provisions of our recent State ConstiÂ­
tutions, after an experience of eighty years, are so simiÂ­
it lar and so excellent, that it would be dillicult to go far
_
wrong at the present day in framing a new CuIstita
ioun.
I then believed, and still belheve, that, under the or.
,r gnaoi act, the Kansas Convention were bound to submit
d this all-important quesuon of slavery to the people. It
was never, however, my opinion that, independently of'
this act, they would have been bound to submit any perÂ­ '
Lion of the Con:tituuen to a popular vote, in order to
d give it validity Had I entertained such an opinion,
this would have been its opp'sition to many precedents
in our history, eommnenomg in the beat age of the Re
public. It ould buhave been in opposition to the priu-,
e ciple which pervades our institutions-and which is
every day carried out into prao:ice-that the people
t. have the right to delegate to representatives, chos n by
taemselves, their sovereign power to frane oonstitutioa.,
enact laws, and perform many other imporlaut acts,
without requiring that these should be subjected to their
subsequent approbatlon It would be a mtost inconveÂ­
Snient limitation of their own power, iniposed by the
people upon themselves, to exclude them from exercising
,.
their sovereignty in any lawful manner they think
Spruper. It is true that the people of Kansas might, ii
Sthey had pleased, have required the Convention to subÂ­
mit the Constitution to a popular vote; but this they
t have not done. The only remedy, therefore, in this
it case, is that vwhichl exibts in all other similar cases. If
, the delegates who framed the Kansas Constitution have
min any manner violated the will of their constituona,
t the people alwa:,s possess the power t> ohange their
constitution or their laws, according to their own
pleasere.
T'ie question of slavery was submitted to an election


o, o theme people of liarcsa on the 21st of December last,
L. obedience to the mandate of the Constitution Here,
again, a fair opportunity was presented to the adherents
;
of he Topeka Constitution, if they were the majority,
to decide this exciting question "" in theirown way,"" and
- thus restore peace to thedistracted Territory ; but they
a again refused to exercise their rights of popular sovÂ­
, reignty, and again suffered the election to pass by
default.
I heartily rejoice that a wiser and better spirit preÂ­
vailed among a large majority of these people on the
first Monday of January; and that they did, on that
e day, vote under the Lecompton Constitution for GoverÂ­
n nor and other State officers, a member of Congress,
and for members of the Legislature. This election was
warmly contested by the parties, and a larger vote was
r polled than at any previous election in the Territory.
e We may now reasonably hope that the revolutionary
e Topeka organization will be speedily and finally abanÂ­
. doned, and this will go far towards the final settlement
s of the unhappy differences in Kansas. If frauds have
been committed at this election, either by one or both
e parties, the Legislature and the people of Kansas, under
v
their Conatitution, will know how to redress themselves
a punish these detestable, but too common crimes without
o
any outside interference.
The people of Kansas have, then, ""in their own
u
way,"" and in strict accordance with the organio act,
framed a Constitution and State Government; have
submitted the all imrsportant question of slavery to the
people, and have elected a Governor, a member to repÂ­
resent them in Congress, members of the State LegisÂ­
lature, and other State officers. They now ask admisÂ­
sion into the Union under this Constitution, which is
I
republican in its form. It is for Congress to decide
whether they will admit or reject the State which has
thus been created. For my own part, I am decidedly
t
in favor of its admission, and thus terminating the KanÂ­
sas question.
I his will carry out the great principle of
non-intervention recognized and sanctioned by the orÂ­
ganio act, which declares in express language in favor
of non-intervention by Congress with slavery in the
States or Territories,"" leaving "" the people thereof perÂ­
fectly free to form and regulate their domestic instituÂ­
tions in their own way, subject only to the Constitution
of the United States."" In this manner, by localizing I
the question of slavery, and confining it to the people
whom it immediately concerned, every patriot anxiously
expected that this question would be banished from the
lalls of Congress, where it has always exerted a baleÂ­
fhi influence throughout the whole country.
It is proper that I should briefly refer to the election i
held under an not of the Territorial Legislature, on the 1




 first Monday of January last, on the Leeormpt ,n Con
stitution. This eleotion was hold after the Territory
had been prepared for admission into the Union as a
sovereign State, and when no authority existed in the
Territorial Legislature which could possibly destroy its
existence or change itaoharacter. Theelection, which
was practioably conducted under my instructions, inÂ­
volved a strange inconsistency. A large majority of
the persons who voted against the Lecompton ConstiÂ­
tution, were, at the very same t'me and place, recogÂ­
nizing its valid existence in thenmost solemn and authea
tie manner, by voting under its provisions. I have
yet received no official information of the result of this
election.
As a question of expediency, after the right has been
maintained, it may be wise to reflect upon the benefits
to Kansas and to the whole country which would re
sult from its immedists admission into the Union, as
well as the disasters which may follow its rejection.Â­
Domestic peace will be the happy consequence of its
admission, and that fine Territory, which has hitherto
been torn by dissensions, will rapidly increase in popÂ­
ulation and wealth, and speedily realize the blessings
and the comforts which follow in the train of agriÂ­
cultural and mechanical industry. The people will
then be sovereign, and can regulate their own affairs
in their own way. If a majority of them desire to
abolish domestic slavery within the State, there is no
other possible mode by which this can be effeoted so
speedily as by prompt edmission. The will of the ma
jority is supreme and irresistible when expressed in an
orderly and lawful manner. They can make and on
make constitutions at pleasure. It would be abhurd to
say that they can impose fetters upon their own power
which they cannot afterwards remove. If they could
do this they might tie their own hands for a huadred
as well as for ten years.
These are fundamental principles of American freeÂ­
dom, and are recognized. I believe, in some forr or
other, by every State Constltu'iun; and if Congrees in
the ot of admiesion, should think proper to recognize
them. I can perceive no objection toi such a course.Â­
This has been done emphatically in the Constitution ofl
Kunsas. It declares in the bill of rights that 'nil politiÂ­
cal power is inherent in the people, and all free governÂ­
nlents are founded on their authority and instituted for
their benefit, and therefore they have at all times an
inalienable and indefeasible right to alter, reform, or
abolish their form of government in such manner as
they may think proper."" The great State of New
York is at this moment governed under a constitution
framed and established in direct opposition to the mode
i prescribed by the preuous consti:unton If, therefore,
the provision changing the Knesaa Constitution. after
the year one thousand eight hundred and sixty-four,
could by possibility be construed into a prohibition to
make such a change previous to that period, this prohi
bition would be wholly unavailing. The Leeislature
already elected may, at its very first session, eubmiit the
question to a vote of the people, whether they will or
will not have a Convention to amend their C(,ustiutioi,
and adopt all necessary means for giving effect to the
ponolar will.
It has been solemnly adjudged by the highest judiÂ­
cial tribunal known to our laws, that slavery exists in
Kansas by virtue of the Constitution of the United
States. Kansas is, therefore, at this moment as much
a stave State as Georgia or South Carolina. Without
this, the equality of the sovereign States composing the
Union would be violated, and the use and enjoyment of
a territory acquired by the common treasure of all the
States, would be closed against the people and the propÂ­
erty of nearly half the members of the confederacy.
Slavery can therefore never be prohibited in Kansas, exÂ­
eapt by means of a constitutional provision, and in no
other manner can this be obtained so promptly, if a maÂ­
jirity of the people desire it, as by admitting it into the
Union under its present Constitution.
On the other hand, should Congress reject the ConÂ­
stitution, under the idea of affording the disaffected in
Kansas a third opportunity of prohibiting slavery in the
State, which they might have done twice before if in
the majority, no man can foretell the consequences.
If Congress, for the sake of those men who refused
to vote for delegates to the Convention, when they
might have excluded slavery from the Constitution, and
who afterwards refused to vote on the 21st December
last, when they might, as they claim, hare stricken
slavery from the Constitution, should now reject the
State, because slavery remains in the Constitution, it is
manifest that the agitation upon this dangerous subject
will be renewed in a more alarming form than it has
ever yet assumed.
Every patriot in the country had indulged the hope
that the Kansas Nebrasks act would put a final end to
the slavery agitation, at least in Congress, which had
for more than twenty years convulsed the country and
endangered the Union. This act involved great and funÂ­
damental principles, and if fairly carried into effect
will settle the question. Should the agitation be again
revived, should the people of the sister States be again
estranged from each other with more than their
former bitterness, this will arise from a cause, so far as
the interests of Kansas are concerned, more trifling and
insignficant than has ever stirred the elements of a
great people into commotion. To the people of Kansas,
the only practical difference between admission orrejecÂ­
tion, depends simply upon the fact whether they can
themselves more speedily change the present ConstituÂ­
tion if it does not accord with the will of the majority,
or frame a second Constitution to be submitted to ConÂ­
gress be""eafter. Even if this were a question of more
expediency, and not of right, the small difference of
time, one way or the other, is of not the least imporÂ­
tance, when contrasted with the evils which must necÂ­
essarily result to the whole country from a revival of
the slavery agitation.
In considering this question, it should never be forÂ­
gotten that, in proportion to its insignificance, let the deÂ­
cision be what it may, so far as it may affect the few
thousand inhabitants of Kansas, who have from the beÂ­
ginning resisted the Constitution and the laws, for this
very reason the rejection of the Constitution will be so
much the more keenly felt by the people of fourteen of
the Statesof this Union, where slavery is recognized
under the Constitution of the United States.
Again: The speedy admis-ion of Kansas into the
Union would restore peace and quiet to the whole counÂ­
try. Already the affairs of this Territory have engrossÂ­
ed an undue proportion of publi attention. They have
sadly affected the friendly relations of the people of the
States with each other, and alarmed the fears of patri
ots for the safety of the Union. Kansas once admitted
into the Union, the excitement becomes localized, and
will soon dio away for want of outside aliment. Then
every ditficulty will he settled at the ballot-hox.
Besides-and this is no trifling oonsideration--I shall
then be enabled to withdraw the troops of the United
States from Kansas, and employ them on branches ef
service where they aremuch needed. They have been
kept there, on the earnest importunity of Gov. Walker,
to maintain the existance of the Territorial Govern
ment and secure the oexecution or the laws. lie considÂ­
ered that at least 2000 regular troops, under the comÂ­
mand of (Gen. Harney, were necessary for this purpose
Acting under his reliable information, I have been


obliged, in some degree, to interfere with the expediÂ­
tion to Utah, in order to keep down rebellion in Kansas.
This has involved a very heavy expense to the GovernÂ­
ment. Kansas once admitted, it is believed there will
no longer be any oceseion there for troops of thoUnited
States.
I have thus performed my duty en this important
question ;under a deep sense of responsibility to G.,d
and my country. My public life will terminate within
a brief period; and I have no other object of earthly
ambition than to leave my county in a peaceable and
prosperous condition, and to live in the respectand affecÂ­
tions of my countrymen. The dark and ominous clouds
which now appear to be impending over the Union, I
conscientiously believe may be dissipated with honor to
every portion of it, by the admission of Kansas during
the present session of Congress ; whereas, if she should
be rejected, I greatly fear these clouds will become darÂ­
ker and more ominous than any which have ever yet
threatened the Constitution and the Union.

In preparing his famous interstate

""Each year every local paper give from

POSITION IN SLEEPING.
It is better to go to sleep on the right
side, for then the stomach is very much in
the position of a bottle turned upside down,
and the contents are aided in passing out
by gravitation. If one goes to sleep on the
left side, the operation of emptying the
stomach of its contents is more like drawÂ­
ing water from a well. After going to sleep,
let the body take its own position. If you
sleep on your back, especially soon after
a hearty meal, the weight of the digestive
organs, and that of the food, resting on the
. . . . , .. , , ,
great vein of the body, near the back bone.
compresses it, and arrests the flow of the
blood more or less. If the arrest is partial
the sleep is disturbed, and there are unÂ­
pleasant dreams. If the meal has been reÂ­
cent or hearty, tho arrest is more decided,
and the various sensations, such as fulling
over a-precipico, or the pursuit of a wild
beast, or other impending danger, and the
desperate effort to get rid of it, arouses us,

and sends on the stagnating blood, and we in tho eyeg of the worldf ue Khould be a

                 Never begin to read, or write, or sew, for several minutes after coming from darkness to a bright light.

                 Never read or sew directly in front of the light, or window, or door.
                 It is best to have the light fall from above, obliquely over the left shoulder.

                 Do not use the eye-sight by light so scant that it requires an effort to discriminate.

One of the greatest triumphs of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound is
the conquering of woman's dread enemy. Fibroid Tumor.
The growth of these tuinora is sosly that frequently their presence is not sus

pected until they are far
advanced.
So-called ""wandering
pains'' may come from its
early stages, or the presÂ­
ence of danger may be
made manifest by exÂ­

pain extending from the
ovaries down the groin
and thighs.
If you have mysterious
pains, if there are indicaÂ­
tions of inflammation or
displacement, don't wait
for time to confirm your
fears and go through
the horrors of a hospital

operation; secure Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound right away and
begin its use.
Mrs. Pinkham, of Lynn, Mass., will jrive you her advice free of all charge if you
will write her about yoursc! f. Your letter will be seen by women only, and you
need hare no hesitation about being perfectly frank.""
Read what Mrs. B. A. Lomhaud, 1ox 71, W'estdale, Mass., says:
""I have reason to think that I would not be here now if it bad not been for Lydia
E. rinkham's Vegetable Compound. It cured me of a fibroid tumor ia my womb.
Doctors could do nothing forme, and they could not cure mc at the hospital. I
will tell you about it. I had been in my usual health, but had worked quite
hard. 'Whenmy monthly period came on I flowed very badly. The doctor gave
me medicine, but it did me no good. He said the flow must be stopped if possible,
and he must find the cause of my trouble. Upon examination he found there
wasa fibroid tumor in my womb, and pave me treatment without any benefit
whatever. About that time a lady called on me and recommended Lydia E.
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound: said she owed her life to it. I said I would
try it, and did. Soon after the flow became more natural and regular. I still
continued taking tbe Compound for some time. Then the doctor made an ex

amination again, and found everything
and that dull ache was gone.''

Trouble Ahead,

When the appetite fails, and sleep grows
restless and unrefreshing, there is trouble
ahead. The digestive organs, when healthy,
crave food, the nervous system, when vigorous
and tranquil, gives its possessor no uneasiness
at night. A tonic, to be effective, should not
be a mere appetitizer, nor are the nerves to be
strengthened and soothed by the unaided acÂ­
tion of a sedative or a narcotic. What is reÂ­
quired is a medicine which invigorates the
stomach and promotes assimilation of food
by the system, by which means the nervous
system, as well as other parts of the physical
organism are strengthened. These arc the efÂ­
fects of Hostctter's Stomach bitters, a mediÂ­
cine whose reputation is founded llrmly in
public confidence, and which physicians comÂ­
mend for its tonic, anti-billious and other
properties. It is used with the best results in
fever and ague, rheumatism, kidney and uterÂ­
ine weakness and other maladies.

AN IMPORTANT STATE DOCUMENT
Supreihn IPowrr of the MllIItnry GovÂ­
ernor--Courtis nd Conetubulary
1Will Stand.





WASHINGTON. July 18.-A state paper
that will be historic, marking an epoch in
American history, was issued tonight by
direction of President McKinley. It proÂ­
vides in general terms for the government
of the province of Santiago de Cuba, and
is the first document of the kind ever preÂ­
pared by a president of the United States.
By order of Secretary Alger, AdjutantÂ­
General Corbhin tonight sent the document
to General Shafter, In command of the
military forces at Santiago. The paper
iS not only an authorization and instrucÂ­
tion to General Shafter for the governÂ­
ment of the captured territory, but also a
proclamation to the people of the territory
of the intentions of the government of the
United Statey regarding, thein and their
interests. It marks the formal establishÂ­
ment of a nettw Iolltlcal pWveri.ln the island
of Cuba, and Insures to the-people of the
territory over which the power extends
absolute securlfit in the exercise of their
private rights and relations, as well as
security to their persons and property. The
full text of the dociument Is as follows:
""Adjutant-general's office, Washington,
D. C., July 18, 1898.
""General Shafter, Santiago, Cuba: The
following is sent you for your information
and guidance.' It will be 'piblished In such
a manner in both EniglishÂ­ drid Spanish as
will give It.t he widest circulatiop in the
territory under your control:
S""Executive Mansion, Washington, D. C.,
SJuly 18, 1898.
""To the Secretary of War-Sir: The caÂ­
pitulation of the Spanish forces in SanÂ­
tiago de Cuba and in the eastern cart of
the province of Santiago and the occupaÂ­
--.tion of the territory by the forces of the
United States; rendgr it necessary to inÂ­
struct the military comamnder of the
Unlted States as to the conduct which he
is to observe during inlditary occupation.
""The first effect of the military occupaÂ­
tion of the enemy's territory is the severÂ­
ance of the former political relations of the
inhabitants and the .establishment of a
iiew political pobwr., ly this changed conÂ­
dition of things, theÂ­ nhabitants, so long
as they perform their duties, are entitled
to security in their persons and property
and in all their private rights and relaÂ­
tions. It Is my desire that the inhabitaiits
of Cuba should be aceiialited with the
burpose of the United States to discharge,
to the-fullest extent, its obligations in this
.regard. It will, therefore, be the duty of
the commander of the army of occupation
to announce and proclaim, in the most
public manner, that we come hot tb make
war upon the inhabitants of Cuba, nor
u. on any party or faction among them:
,""iut to. protect them in their homes, in
their employments and in their personal
aiid religious rights. All persons who,
S'either by active aid or by honest submisÂ­
sion; co-operate with the United States in
its efforts to give effect to this benelteent
Durpole, will receive the reward of Its
support and protection. Our occupation
s hould be de free frotm severity as pbssiÂ­
ble.
""Though the powers of the military ocÂ­
cupation are absolute and supreme, and
.immediately operate upon the piolitical
condition of the inhabltants, the munidipal
laws of the conquered territory, such ad
affect private rights of person and propÂ­
erty and provide for the punishment of
crime, are considered as continuing in
force, so far as they are compatible with
the news order of thinigs, until they are
sultspended or superseded by the occupying
belligerent; and inh practice they are not
usually abrogated, but are allowed to reÂ­
main in force,Â­ and to be administered by
.the ordinary tribunals substantially as
they wetie before the occupation. This eÂ­
lightened practice is, so far as possible,
to be adhered to on the present occasion.
""The judges and.other offlicialsconnected
with the administration of justice may,
if they ateept the supremacy of the Uiited
States, continue to administer the ordinary
iaw of the land, as between man and tnan
trider the supervision of the American
cominander-in-chief.
""The native constabulary will, so far as
:' inay be practicable, be preserVdd.
""The freedom of the people to lpursue
their arccustomed occupations will be
abridged only when it may beÂ­ necessary
to do so.
""While the rule of conduct of the AmerÂ­
::ian commander-in-cheif will bb such as
'has just been defltied. It 'lll be his duty
to adopt measures of a different kind, it
u',unfortunately the course of the people
s should render such measures indispensable
to the maintenance of lacw and order. I-e

b-,.,: hunals as may be necessary. In the exÂ­
ercise of these high powers, Ihe commandÂ­
.er must be guided by his judgment and his
;;experience and a high sense of justice.

necessary to deal is that of treathent of

The Presddent Yekterday Signed the
'Triffr Selhedtult"" for the Vort.
WASHINGTON, July 18.-The tariff for
Santiago was signed by President McÂ­
Kinley after a brief conference this afterÂ­
noon with Secretary Gage. The instrucÂ­
tions were cabled to the authorities in
charge of Santiago by Secretary Alger, so0
that the tariff can be put in force toÂ­
morrow. The new tarit abolishes the
discriminative tariff now in operation
there, the rates for different dourltries at
Cuban ports varying. The tariff is based
on the rates on produce of Spain and apÂ­
plies them to all countries, not even
excepting the United States. The most
Important change effected is a reduction
of the tonnage duty on ships carrying
2000 tons or. more, which go in and out of
the port, from the present rate of $1 a
ton to a rate of 20 cents per ton. The
heavy export duty on tobacco and certain
other Cuban products and the 5-cent
export tax on iron ore are retained, for
a while at least.

                 ""The, winters of 1658, 1659, and 1660, were in. tensely cold.-The rivers in Italy bore heavy car. ; and so much snow had not fallen at Rome for several ce-. It was in 1658 that Charles X. of Sweden crossed the Little Belt over the ice from Holstein to Denmark, with his , foot and horse, followed by the train of baggage and artillery. During these years the price of grain was nearly doubled in England; a circumstance which contributed, among other causes, to its restoration.

                 ""hIn 1684, the winter was excessively cold. Many , and even the oaks in England, were split by the frost. Most of the hollies were killed. Coaches drove along the Thames, which was covered with ice. eleven inches thick. Almost all the birds perished.
                 ""In 1691, the cold was so excessive, that the famished wolves entered Vienna, and attacked the cattle and even men.
                 ""The winter of 1695 was extremely severe and protracted. The frost in Germany began in October, and continued till April, and many people were frozen to death.

All the rivers and lakes were frozen, and even the seas-to the distance of several miles from the shore. The frost is said to have penetrated three yards into the ground.Birds and wild beasts were strewed dead in the fields and men perished by the thousands in their houses. The more tender shrubs and vegetables in England were killed; and wheat rose in price from 21. to 41. a quarter. In the south of France, the olive plantations were almost entirely destroy.ed; nor have they yet recovered that fatal disaster. The Adriatic Sea was quite frozen. over, and even ,the Mediterranean about Genoa; and the citron and .-orange-groves suffered extremely in the -finest parts of Italy.

                 ""In 1744, the winter was again very cold. The Mayne was covered seven weeks with ice; and at Evora, in Portugal, people could hardly creep out of their houses for heaps of snow.

Many people were frost-bitten, and vast multitudes both of the feathered and of the finny tribes perished. Yet the quantity of snow which lay on the ground had checked the penetration of the frost. Van Swinden found in Holland that the earth was congealed to the depth of 21 inches, on a spot of a garden which had been kept cleared, but only 9 inches at another place near it, which was covered with 4 inches of snow.

scoiety on the subject of New Haven's
Blue Laws. Mr. Newton said in part:
The first two are as follows: (1) The
governor and magistrates convened and
the general assembly are the supreme
power under God of this independent
dominion. (2) From ,the determination
of the assembly no appeal shall be made.""
The third blue law is: ""The governor
is amenable to the voice of the people.""
The fourth blue law is: ""The governor
shall have only a single vote in determinÂ­
ing any question except a P5'asting vote
when the assembly may be equally diÂ­
vided.""
The fifth blue law is: ""The assembly
of the people shall not be dismissed by
,the people, but shall dismiss itself.""
The sixth blue law reads: ""Conspiracy
against this dominion shall be punished
with death.""
The seventh blue law says: ""WhosoÂ­
ever says there is power and jurisdiction
above and over this dominion shall sufÂ­
fer death and loss of property.""
The eighth blue law. reads: '""Whoever
attempts to change or overturn this doÂ­
minion shall suffer death.""
The ninth blue law says: ""The judges
shall determine controversies without a
jury."" This was .undoubtedly the law
in New Haven colony. It is law now
in this State, wherever and in so far as
the judges can make it so.
Only gCltrceh Members Vote.
The tenth blue law declares: ""No one
shall be a free. man or give a vote, unless
he be converted and a member in full
communion of one of the churches al-.
lowed in this dominion."" This is a fair
statement.
The eleventh blue law says: ""No man
shall hold any office who is not soundÂ­
in faith and faithful to this dominion;
and whoever giv'es a vote to such a perÂ­
son shall pay a fine of Â£1; for a second
offense he shall be disfranchised.""
The rule that only church members
should vote was, maintained as an ordiÂ­
nance of God. Any protest .against it
was considered to be seditious and. treaÂ­
sonable, and severely punished.
The twelfth blue law: ""Each free man
shall swear by the blessed God to beart
true allegiance to this dominion, and'
that Jesus is the only king.""
/ BOoycott of Quakers.
Thirteenth blue law: ""No Quaker or
dissenter from the established worship

ing shall be offered to a Quaker, Adamite
or other heretic."" -
Fifteenth blue law: ""If any person turns
Quaker 'he shall be banished .and not

The principal law against,.Quakers'. was
made in .1f58..
Sixteenth .blue law: b .lpriest 'shall

a warrant."" The law against Qu'akers
included other blasphemous heretids, a~nd""
would"" doubtless have includedÂ­ Roman

Training Horses 1
pinners Home Journal
A very simple method and an improveÂ­
ment upon the Rarey system of training
viscious horses was says the Rural CanaÂ­
dian exhibited at West Philadelphia
recently and the riianner in which some
of the wildest horses were subdued was
astonishing The first trial was made on
a kicking or balking mare which her
owner said had allowed no rider on her
back for at least five years She became
tame in about as many minutes and alÂ­
lowed herself to be ridden about without
a sign of her former wildness The
means by which the result was accomÂ­
plished was a light piece of rope which
was passed around the front jaw of the
mate just above the front teeth crossed
in her mouth thence secured back of her
neck It was claimed that no horse will
kick or jump wfien thus secured and
that a horse after receiving that treats
ment a few times will abandon liis vis
cious wavs forever A simple method

the almost unanimous sentiment of

ment of that island-a proposition
which failed of adoption-the congress,
after conference on the 19th of April,

declaring:
""First, that the people of the island
of Cuba are and by right ought to be
free and independent.
""Second, that it is the duty of the
UTnited States and the government o_
the United States hereby demands that
the government of Spain at once reÂ­
linquish its authority in the island of
Cuba and withdraw its land and naval
forces from Cuba and Cuban waters.
""Third, that the president of the
United States be and hereby is directÂ­
ed and empowered to use the entire
land and naval forces of the United
States, and the militia of the several
states, to such extent as may be necesÂ­
sary to carry these resolutions into efÂ­
feet.
""Fourth, that the United States
hereby disclaims any disposition or inÂ­
tention to obtain sovereignty oveÂ­ the
said island, except for the pacification
thereof, and asserts its determination
when that is accomplished to leave

This resolution was approved by the
executive on the next day, April 20. A
copy was at once communicated to


who forthwith announced his continuÂ­
ance in Washington had. thereby beÂ­
come impossible and asked for his
passports, which were given him. He
thereupon withdrew from 'Washington,
leaving the protection of Spanish inÂ­
terests in the United States to the
French ambassador and the AustroÂ­
Hungarian minister. Simultaneously
with its communication to the Spanish
minister, Gen. Woodford, the AmeriÂ­
can minister at Madrid, was teleÂ­
graphed confirmation of the text of
the joint resolution and directed to
communicate it to the government of
Spain with the formal demand that it
at once relinquish its authority and
government in the island of Cuba and
withdraw its forces therefrom, coupÂ­
ling this demand with announcement
of the intentions of this government
as to the future of the island, in conÂ­
formity with the fourth clause of the
resolution and giving Spain until noon
of April 23 to reply.
The demand, although, as above
shown, officially made known to the
Spanish envoy here was not delivered
at Madrid. After the instructions
reached Gen. Woodford, on the mornÂ­
ing of April 21, but before he could
present it, the Spanish minister of
state notified him that tipon the presiÂ­
dent's approval of the joint resolution
the !Madrid government, regarding the
act as ""equivalent to an evident decÂ­
laration of war,"" had ordered its minÂ­
ister in Washington to withdraw-,
thereby breaking off diplomatic relaÂ­

ceasing all official communication beÂ­
tween their respective countries.

existence of a' state of war between the an
Jhdi.ted 'States and 'Spain recommendÂ­ SC
ed. The congress accordingly voted on to
the same day the act approved April Pry
25, 1898, declaring the existence of
such war from and including the 21st $5,
clay of April and re-enacted the proÂ­ re
vision of the resolution of April 20, rn
directing the president to use all the
armed forces of the nation to carry c
that act into effect. ,Due notification
of the existence of war, as aforesaid, exi
was given April 25th by telegraph to
all the governments with which the:
United States maintained relations in brt
order that their neutrality might be.as:Â­ t
sured during the war. The various coc
governments responded with procla.Â­ of
mations of neutrality, each after its
own methods. It is not among the shc
least gratifying incidents of the strugÂ­ sh
gle that the obligations of neutrality str
were impartially discharged: by all, ofÂ­
ten under delicate and difficult circumÂ­
stances. r
'In further fulfillment of internaÂ­ to
tional duty, I issued., April 26, a procÂ­ tin
lamnation 'announcing the treatment Co:
proposed to be accorded to vessels and we
their -cargoes as to Wbhockade, contraÂ­ nia
band,the exercise of the right of search iss
and the immunity of neutral flags tic

A similar proclamation was made by ceE
the ISpanish government. In the conÂ­ tel,
duct of hostilities the rules of the str
declaration of Paris, including abstenÂ­ the
tion from resort to privateering, have brE
accordingly been observed by both for
'belligerents, although neither was a a
party to that declaration. tot
Our country thus, after an interval col
of half a century of peace with all poi
-nations, found itself engaged in deadÂ­ tio
ly conflict with a foreign enemy. EvÂ­ ati
ery nerve was strained to meet the Pa
emergency. The response to the iniÂ­ ing
tial call for 125,000 volunteers was inÂ­ to
stant and complete, as was also the los
result of the second call on May 5 for nu
75,000 additional volunteers. The ranks wa
of the regular army were increased to lar
the limits provided by the act of April *my
25. The enlisted force of, the navy on up
the 15th day of August showed its ste
maximum number, 24,123 men and apÂ­ '
prentices. One hundred: and, three vesÂ­ up
sels were added to the navy by purÂ­ the
chase, one was presented' to the govÂ­ tar
ernment, one leased and four vessels the
of the International Navigation comÂ­ com

four light-house tenders and 19 misce;Â­ co
laneous vessels. Much alarm was fei l'h
along the entire Atlantic seaboard les .Io
an attack might be made by the enÂ­ a
emy. Every precaution was taken tc C
prevent possible injury to our great a
cities lying along the coast. TemporÂ­ ""e
ary garrisons were provided, drawn 3P
from the state militia, infantry and tec
light batteries were drawn from the Ur
volunteer force. About 12,000 troops Pir
were thus employed. The .coast signal -om
service was established for observins tin
the approach of an enemy's ship to the ab
coast of the United; States and the W""
lighthouse service co-operated, which Pe
enabled the navy department to have Cg
all portions of the Atlantic codst, from tht
iMaine to Texas, under observation. ta
The auxiliary navy gathered under I
the order of congress was officered and he
manned :by the naval militia of the sri
several states. This organization paÂ­ o
trolled the coast and performed the Pc
duty of a second arm of defense. tr
Under the direction of the chief enÂ­
gineer, su~bnarine mines were placed
at the most exposed points. Befores '
t hoe war permanent mining casema.tes er
and cable galleries had been constructÂ­
'd at all imDortant harbors. Most o!

April 19 district officers were directed 0o
to take all nreliminarv measures. short


of the actual attaching of the loaded a""
mines to the cable and on April 22 telÂ­ po
ographic orders were issued to place ie
the loaded mines in position. The agÂ­ he
bregate num'ber of mines placed was
1,255, at the principal harbors from )
Maine to California. Preparation e
were also made for the planting of
mines at certain other harbors, but
owing to the early destruction of th h
Spanish fleet these mines were noi
placed.
The signal corps was promptly orÂ­
ganized and performed service of the ii
most difficult and important charac
ni
ler. Its operations during the wai dil
covered the electrical connection of al a
coast fortifications, the establishment
of telephonic and telegraphic facilitie:
for the camps at Manila, Santiago an( pc
in Porto Rico. There were constructe
300 miles of line at 10 great camps, thu h
facilitating military movements fron
those points in a manner heretofor
unknown in military administration ;h
Field telegraph lines were establishetr M
and maintained under the enemy's fiÂ­ bo
at Manila and later the Manila-Hong
n4
i(ong cable was reopened. In Port. a
Rico cable communication was openec ,
over a discontinued route and on lane :ir
the headquarters of the commandin,
oficer was kept in telegraphic and tel
ephonic communication with the divi
sion commanders on four differeb

in C'uban waters a completely outfitte, )
cable ship with war cables and cabl 31
gc.ar suitable both for the destructioi n
of communications belonging to th yo
enemy and the establishment of ou r

ed under the enemy's batteries at San a
tiago. The day previous to the land -
ing of General Shafter's corps at Cai or
nianera, within 20 miles of the landing a:
place, cable communication was estabÂ­ f
.ished and cable station opened, giv tli
big direct communication with thn i
overnment at Washington. This se Ila

and navy. WVith a total force of over su

abling the government to strengthen po
its defense and to make preparations fr(
greatly needed in case of war. This by

and promptly taken up, the subÂ­ o.
scriptions so.:far exce.eding.,.the call, as, uV
to cover it many times over, while vi

and significant result, showing the vast a
resources of the nation and the deterÂ­ te

counter of the war, in' point of date, a
took place April 27, when a detachment of
of the blockading squadron made a reÂ­ cc
cornnaisance in force' at Matanzas, tÂ­
shelled the harbor fortification and deÂ­
molished several new works in conÂ­ a<
struction. o0
Dewey's Brilliant Engagement.
The next engagement was. destined A
to mark a memorable epoch in mart. C
time warfare. The Pacific fleet, under ti
Commodore Dewey, had lain for some di
weeks at Hong Kong. Upon the coloÂ­ ai
nial proclamation of neutrality being O
issued and the. customary 24 hours, noÂ­ di
tice being given, it repaired to Mirs a:
bay, near Hong Kong, whence it proÂ­ ei
ceeded to the Philippine. islands under de
telegraphic orders 'to capture or deÂ­ is
stroy the formidable Spanish fleet k
then assembled at Manila. At dayÂ­ A
break on the 1st of 'May, .the American st
I
force entered Manila bay and, after MT
L a few hours' engagement, effected the gi
total destruction of the' Spanish fleet, i'
1 consisting of 10 warships and a transÂ­ n;
1 port, 'besides capturing .the naval staÂ­ a'
-
tion and forts at Cavite, thus annihilÂ­ a.
- ating the Spanish naval power in the fc
e Pacific ocean and! completely controllÂ­ h
-
ing the bay of Manila, with the ability p
-
to take the city at will. Not a life was vo
2
lost on our ships, the wounded only w
r
numbering seven,while not a vessel sI
s
was materially injured. For this galÂ­ h
3
lant achievement the congress,. upon a.
1 my recommendation, fitly 'bestowed ti
i
upon the actors preferment and subÂ­ w
s
stantial reward. fe
The effect of this remarkable victory of
- upon the spirit of our people and upon d.
- the. fortunes of the war was instanÂ­ c,
- taneous. Prestige of invincibility bf
s
thereby attached to our arms, which oi
- continued throughout the struggle. ReÂ­ fc
inforcements were hurried to Manila.Â­ w
a under .the command of Major General
- Merritt and firmly established within
e
sight of the capital, which lay helpÂ­
- ess before our guns. On the 7th day S
of May the government was advisedl
fficially of the victory at Manila and cU
at once inquired of the commander of ri
Jur fleet what troops were required. ti
The information was received on the e:
15th day of May and the first army exÂ­ P
e pedition sailed May 25 and arrived at ci
Manila June 30. Other expeditions soon ci
followed, the total force consisting of w
:1 officers and 15,058 men. h
Only reluctance to cause needless A
oas of life and"" property prevented the 01
d
-arly storming and capture of the city g
and therewith the' absolute military ti
Jccupancy of the whole group. The inÂ­ ir
;urgents, meanwhile, had resumed the o0
tctive hostilities suspended by the unÂ­ it
completed truce of December, 1897. T
Their forces invested Manila on the e2
.iorthern and eastern side, but were S
:onetrained by Admiral Dewey and Ul
c
general Merritt from attempting an as' cE
;t ault. It was fitting that -whatever U
was to be done in the way of decisive to
, perations in that quarter should be W
e ccomplished by the strong arm of the a
Uniteid States alone. Obeying the stern sl
precept of war, which enjoins the overÂ­ Il
.oming of the adversary and the exÂ­ W
tinction of his power wherever assailÂ­ ce
able as the speedy and sure means to v
win a peace, divided victory was not ti
permissible, for no partition of the Ii
e
tigihts and responsibilities attending S
the enforcement of a just and advanÂ­ ti
tageous peace could be thought of. si
r Following the coming of the compreÂ­ tt
3
hensive scheme of general attack powÂ­ T
e erful forces were assembled at various' 0'
points on our coast to invade Cuba and d
Â·
Porto Rico. Meanwhile, naval demonÂ­ n
strations were made at several exÂ­ s
posed points. On May 11, the cruiser ci
W filmington and torpedo boat Winslow o
were unsuccessful in an attempt to siÂ­
ence the batteries at Cardenas,
tgainst Matanzas, Worth Bagley and s5
our seamen falling. These grievous P
atalities were strangely enough among a
he veiry few which occurred during out ti
saval operations in this extraordinary w
:onflict. J
Meanwhile, the Spanish preparations S


had been pushed with great vigor. A c
.owerful squadron under Admiral CerÂ­ ie
vera., which had assembled at the Cape o0
Verde islands before the outbreak of e:
hostilities, had crossed the ocean and h
oy its eratic movements in the CarriÂ­ ti
lean sea delayed oui' military operaÂ­ \
!ons while baffling the pursuit of our D
fleets. For a time fears were felt lest ti
he Oregon and Marietta, then nearing P
iome after their long voyage from Â«
San Francisco of over 15,000 miles, P
night be surprised 'by Admiral .Cer tl
zera's fleet, but their fortunate arrival P
iispelled the apprehensions and lent J
nuch needed reinforcements. Not unÂ­ a
:il Admliral Cervera took refuge in the. P
Sarbor
of Santiago de Cuba, about May a
w,
was it practical to plan a systematÂ­ a
c military attack .upon the Antillean a
possessions of Spain. V
Several demonstrations occurred on G
:.he coast of Cuba and Porto Rico in e
preparation for the, larger event. On A
Iay 13, the north Atlantic squadron
shelled San, Juan de Porto Rico.. On t
XMay 30, Commodore Schley's squadron fI
bombarded the forts guarding,. the e
nouth of Santiago harbor. Neither atÂ­
:ack had any material result. It was c`
'
vident that well-ordered land operaÂ­ g
`ions were indispensable to achieve a
|
ecided advantage. I

The next act in the war thrilled not n
r one the hearts of our countrymen,

i
S;m.
On the night of June 3, LieutenÂ­ t
â€¢ nt Hobson, aided by seven devoted
v olunteers, blocked the narrow outlet t
1
eom Santiago harbor by sinking the
ollier Merrimac in the channel, under f
1
a fierce fire from the shore batteries,
scaping with their lives by a miracle,
but falling into the hands of the SpanÂ­
r ards. It is a most gratifying incident
"" f the war that the bravery of this litÂ­
tle band of heroes was cordially appreÂ­
iated by the Spaniards, who sent a
lag of truce to notify Admiral SampÂ­
n on of their safety and, to compliment
y them upon their daring act. They were ""
.r
subsequently exchanged, July 7.
p By June 7 the cutting of the last 1

Cuban cable isolated the island. ThereÂ­
after the invasion was vigorously prosÂ­ 1

c p)rotecting fire, a landing force of 600
nr
marines from the Oregon, Marblehead
n and Yankee was effected on GuantanaÂ­
s.
imo bay, where it had been determined
1Â­
to establish a naval station. This im-Â­
n portant and essential port was taken
is
from the enemy after severe fighting
is
by the marines, who were the first orÂ­ I
ganized force of the United States to a


landr in Cuba. The position so won wh
was held, despite thei desperate atÂ­ per
tempts' tbo dislodige our forces. By June ser
16.additional forces were landed and:
I
strongly intrenched. wo
On June 22 the advance of the invadÂ­ wa
ing-army under Major General Sihafter list
I landed at Daiquiri, about 15 miles' east cer
of Santiago. This was accomplished ed,
under great difficulties, 'but with mar-c kil
velous dispatch. On June 23 the moveÂ­ of

On :the 24th the first s-erious engage-, wh

of:General .Wheeler's division, particiÂ­ oui
pated, losing heavily. By nightfall, lan
however, ground within five miles gf an(
Santiago was won. The advantage was far
steadily increased. On July 1 a severe arr
battle took place, our forces, gaining ed
the outer works of Santiago and El CaÂ­ car
ney and San Juan were taken after or
a desperate charge and the investment exe
of the city was completed. The navy not
co-operated by shelling the town and on(
the coast forts. C
On: the day following this brillialit an
achievement of our land forces, July 3,. Cu
occurred the decisive naval combat of of
the war. The Spanish fleet, attempting cor
to leave the harbor, was met by the oui
American squadron under comimand or Utn
Commodore Sampson. In less than Th
three hours all the Spanish. ships were Ste
destroyed, and two torpedo boats sunk I
and the Maria Teresa, Almirante mo

deplorably large, some 600 persons per.. Un

Although our ships were repeatedly the

Surrender of Santiago. sae
With the catastrophe of Santiago, trig
Spain's effort upon the ocean virtualÂ­ ouc
i y ceased. 'A spasmodic effort toward ma
the end of June to send; her MediterÂ­ for
ranean fleet under Admiral Camara ext
to relieve Manila was, abandoned, the gal
expedition being recalled after it had der
passed, through the Suez canal. The cci
capitulation of Santiago followed. The pee
city was closely besieged by land, of
while the entrance of our ships into the in
harbor cut off all relief on that side. anI
After a .truce to allow of the removal any
of the non-comlbatants protracted neÂ­ col
gotiations continued from July 3 unÂ­ I
til July 15, when, under the menace of sta
immediate assault the preliminaries ou0
of surrender were agreed' upon. On the cal
i ith, General S'hafter occupied the city. for
The capitulation embraced the entire acl
eastern end of Cuba. The number of Pri
Spanish soldiers surrendered was 22,Â­ Vol

u0O, all of whom' were subsequently
conveyed to Spain at the charge of the
United States. The story of success is 'i
told in the report of the secretary of vel
war. The individual valor of officers tio
and soldiers was never more strikingly the

leading to -the surrender of Santiago, a
while the prompt movements and sucÂ­ av:

With the fall of Santiago, the occuÂ­ 10,

strategic necessity. General Miles had sta
previously been assigned to organize ter
an expedition for that purpose. ForÂ­ Rit

Iquadron assisted, the capital surrenÂ­ of

The total 'asualties in killed, and or

while our navy was engaged in two fr

bombardments and more than 50,000 of or
our troops were transported -to distant 1)E
lands and engaged in assault and siege sE

On Aug. 7, 46 days from the date of sc
landing of General Shafter's army in cc
Cuba, and 21 days from the surrender. J
of, Santiago, the United States troops jo
commenced embarkation for home and et
our entire force was' returned to the ti,
United States, as early as Aug. 24.' U
They were absent from the United is
States only two.months. tr
It is fitting that I should bear testiÂ­ si
mony to the patriotism and, devotion ni
of that large portion of our army, pi
which, although eager to be ordered to m
the post of greater exposure, fortuÂ­ bi
nately was not required outside of the W
United States. They did their whole SI
duty and, like their comrades at the um
front, have earned 'the gratitude of 1s
the nation. In a' like manner the. offiÂ­
cers and men of the army. and of the pi
navy who remained in their departÂ­ In
ments and stations of the navy, perÂ­ D
formingÂ­ most important duties; conÂ­ G
nected' with the' war and whose reÂ­ ai
quests for assignment in the field' and cc
at sea I was compelled to refuse beÂ­ et
cause their services were indispensible tc
here, are entitled to the highest comÂ­ O
mendation. It is my regret that there ai
seems to be no provision for their suitÂ­ g(
able recognition. im
In this connection' it is' a pleasure for sc
me to mention in terms of cordial apÂ­ 01
probation the useful work of the NaÂ­ vi
tional :Red Cross, both in relief measÂ­ tt
ures preparatory to the campaigns', in
sanitary assistance at several of the
camps of assemblage and later, under
the able and experienced, leadership of ei
the president of the society, Miss Clara SE
Barton, on the fields of battle and in rE
the hospitals at the front in Cula. a
WVorking in conjunction. with the govÂ­ tl
ernment authorities, and under their tl
sanction and approval and with the le
enthusiastic co-operation of many paÂ­ di
triotic women and. societies in the variÂ­ m
ous states, the Red Cross has fully pi
maintained its already high reputation lit
for intense earnestness and ability to ui
exercise the noble purpose of its orÂ­
ganiza.tion, thus justifying the confiÂ­ C
dence and support which it has, reÂ­
ceived at the hand's of the American rE
people. To the memibers and officers el
of this society and all who aided them b'
in their philanthropic work, the sincere cc
and lasting gratitude of the soldiers cE
and the public is due and is freely acÂ­ ti
corded. m
In tracing these events we are conÂ­ m
stantly reminded of our obligations :to
our divine Master for i'3is watchful Pi
care over us and, Tis, safe guidance, p
for which the nation makes reverent di

Overtures for Peace. '
The annihilation, of Admiral CerÂ­ n
vera's fleet, followed by the capitulaÂ­ cc
tion of Santiago, having brought to of
the Spanish government a realizing ti
sense of the hopelessness of continuing pi
a struggle now becoming wholly unÂ­ of
availing brought overtures, for peace bE
through the French ambassador, who, re
with the assent of his, government had pl
acted as the friendly representative of tl
Spain's interests during the war. On is
the 26th day of July; 11. Cambon preÂ­ ai
sented a communication signed by cc
Count Almodovar del Rio, the minister
of state, inviting the United, States to
state the terms upon which it would
be willing to make peace. On July 30.
by a communication addressed' to the
Duke Almodovar and handed to M.
Cambon, the terms of this government
were substantially the same as the w
protocol, afterwards signed. On Aug. U
10, dated Aug. 7, their reply was handÂ­ of
ed by M. Cambon to the secretary of di
state. It accepted unconditionally the yr
terms imposed-the surrender of Porto cE
Rico, Cuba, and an island in the LaÂ­ of
drone group-but appeared to seek to se
Introduce inadmissible reservations in
regard to our demand's as to the PhilipÂ­
pines. Conceiving that discussion on


this point could neither be practicable e>
or profitable, I directed that in order g
to avoid misunderstanding the matter al
should be forthwith closed by proposÂ­ er
ing the embodiment in a formal protoÂ­ M
col of the terms' in which the negotia le
tion for peace were undertaken. The er
va'gue and explicit suggestions of the e
Spanish note could not be accepted, th
the only reply being to present as a th
virtual ultimatum a draft of the proÂ­ al
tocol, embodying the precise terms ,
tendered to Spain in our note of July p
30, with added stipulations of detail as i
to the antment pnt of commissioners to
to arrange for the evacuation of the h,
Spanish Antilles. On. Aug. 12 M. Cam-Â­ fa
bon announced his receipt of full powÂ­ m
ers to sign the protocol as submitted. in
Accordingly, on the 15th of August, M. M
Cambon, as the plenipotentiary of di
Spain, and the secretary of state as be
the plenipotentiary for the United ei
States, signed the protocol providing: vi
Article one-Spain will relinquish all f
claim of sovereignty over and title to jo
Cuba. U
Article two-Spain will cede to the A
United States the island of Porto Rico ui
and other islands now under Spanish
sovereignty in the West Indies and
also an island in the Ladrones to be to
selected by the United States. in
Airticle three-=The United States will
occupy and hold the city, bay and harÂ­ tv
bor of Manila pendingÂ­ the conclusion
of a treaty of peace, which shall-deÂ­
termine the. control, disposition and
government of the Philippines.
The fourth article provided for the
appointment of joint commissions on is
the part of the United States. and Spain s
to meet in Havana and. San Juan, reÂ­
spectively, for the purpose of arrangÂ­ i
ng and carrying out the details oif the t
stipulated evacuation of Cuba, Porto ti
Rico and other Spanish islands in the fr
West Indies. cr
The fifth article provided for -the apÂ­ to
,pointment of not more than five comÂ­ of
missioners on each side to meet at th
Paris not later than Oct. 1 and to proÂ­
ceed to the negotiation and conclusion fa
of a treaty of peace, subject to ratifiÂ­
cation according to the respective conÂ­ dt
stitutional forms of the two countries.
The sixth and last article provided Pt
that upon the signature of the protoÂ­
col hostilities between the two counÂ­ tr
tries shall be suspended and. that noÂ­ N
tice to that effect should lhe given asti
soon as possible by each government cr
to the commanders of its naval forces.
Hostilities Snuspended. iir
Immediately upon the conclusion. of he
the protocol, I issued a proclamation te


- on Aug. 12, suspending .hostilities :onr I
the part of the United States. The neÂ­ 1
cessary orders, . to that end were at, t
d once given by telegraph. The blockade t
ir
of the ports of Cuba ands San: Juan de.'
1Â­
Porto Rico was in like manner raised.
Om
- On Aug. 18, the muster out of 100,000

IÂ­
volunteers, or as near that number as i
y,
was found to be practicable, was ordÂ­ ii
it ered. '
e,
On Dec. 1, 101,655 officers and men.
it had been mustered out and discharged
,
""o
from the service;. 9,002 .more will 'be
is
mustered out by .the 10th of the month.
d Also a corrersponding number of genÂ­
f orals and general staff officers have
t been honorably discharged from the
,e
service.
- The military commissions to superinÂ­
h tend the evacuation. of Porto Rico,
IÂ­
Cuba and the adjacent islands were 1

f soon. afteirwards met with the Spanish
n commissioners at Havana and San
q
Juan respectively. The Porto Rican 1
s joint commission speedily, accomplishÂ­
1 ed its task and by Oct., 18 the evacuaÂ­
c tion of the island was completed. The
'. United States flag was raised over the
d island at noon that day. The adminisÂ­
tration of its affairs has been proviÂ­
. sionally intrusted to a military goverÂ­
nor until the congress shall otherwise
, provide. The Cuban joint high comÂ­
o mission has not yet terminated: its laÂ­
- bors. Owing to the difficulties in the
e way of removing the large numbers, of
le
Spanish troops still in Cuba, the evacÂ­
e uation cannot be completed before the
i
1st of January next.
Pursuant to the fifth article of the
e protocol, ""I appointed, William R. Day,
LÂ­ lately secretary of state; Cushman K.
Davis, William P. Frye and George
. Gray., senators, of the United States,
and Whitelaw Reid to be the peace'
d commissioners on the part of the UnitÂ­

""e appointed on the part of the Spanish
tÂ­
government. 'The negotiations have
made hopeful progress, so that I :trust

the meantime, and until. congress has
a legislated otherwise, it will be my
duty to continue the military governÂ­
ment which has existed since our occuÂ­
y pation and give its people security in
i life and property and encouragement
under a just and beneficent dule.
As soon as we are in possession of
Cuba and have pacified the isiand, it
will be necessary to, give aid and diÂ­
,n rection to this people to form a govÂ­
ernment for themselves. This should
be undertaken at the earliest moment
,e
consistent with safety andi assured sucÂ­
cess. It is important that our relaÂ­
tions with these people shall be of the
most friendly character and our comÂ­
mercial relations close and reciprocal.
It should be our duty to assist in every
I proper way to build up the waste
places of the island, encourage the inÂ­
t dustry of the people and assist them 1
to to form a government which shall be
free and independent, thus realizing
the best aspirations of the Cuban peoÂ­
ple. Spanish rule must be replaced by
a just, benevolent and humane governÂ­
ment, created by the people of Cuba,
capable of performing all international
obligations and which shall encourage
thrift, industry and prosperity and
g promote peace and good will among all
_ of the inhabitants, whatever may have

Magellan straits, nearly a third of the

a the hope that the resort to arbitration, t

11 fair to be settled in like manner by I

I have found occasion to approach
the Argentine government with a view

to remowing differences of rate' charges 1
11 imposed upon, the cables of an AmeriÂ­
can corporation in the transmission beÂ­
tween, Buenos Ayres and' the cities of

exclusive concessions by Uruguay and E.

n is a strong hope that a good underÂ­ 1
n standing will be reached and that the C
important channels .of communication I
between the United States and Atlan.Â­
<
e tic cities of South America may be
freed from an almost prohibitory disÂ­ r
crimination. r
In this relation 'I may be permitted 'i
to express as my sense of the fitness c
of an international agreement whereby C
the interchange of messages over conÂ­ I
necting cables may 'be regulated on a r
fair basis of uniformity. r
The world has seen the' postal system t
developed from a congeries of indeÂ­ '
pendent and exclusive service into a s
well ordered union, in, which' all counÂ­ f
tries found manifold benefits. It would s
'be strange were the nations not in r
time brought to realize that modern r
civilization, which owes so much of its a
progress to the annihilation of space !s
by the electric force, demands this allÂ­ 1 s
important means of communication, a 1,
I heritage of all peoples, to be adminisÂ­ a
n
tered and regulated in their common Â¶1

 'l6half. A step in this direction was l
takeni at the international conference ti
t, of 1884, when an' agreement for the proÂ­ o
teetion of submarine ca;bles was signed, n
:aridn the day is;""I trust, not far distant fi
: when this medium for the transmisÂ­ o

The sympathy of the American peoÂ­ h

Austria's Claims for Damages.
On the 10th of September, 1S97, a conÂ­ c
1 flict took place at Latimer, Pa., beÂ­ s
z tween a body of striking miners, and p
z
the sheriff of Luzerne county and. his g
deputies, in which 22 miners were killed c
and 44 wounded, of which 10 of the
killed and 12 of the wounded were AusÂ­ e
trian and Hungarian subjects. This a
- deplorable event naturally aroused the a
solicitude of the Austro-Hungarian ii
government, which, on the assumption ri
that the killing and wounding involved a
the unjustifiable misuse of authority, 3
claimed reparation for the sufferers. is
e
After a searching investigation the C
f federal executive took appropriate t
steps to learn the merits of the case, s
in order to meet the urgent complaint c
of a friendly, power. The sheriff and a
e his deputies, having been indicted for it
murder, Were tried and acquittedÂ­ after g
protracted, proceedings and the hearing ii
of hundreds of witnesses, on the e
ground that the killing was in the line c
of their official duty to upholdÂ­ law c
and preserve public order in the state. e
f A representative of the department of o
justice attended the trials and reported t
its course fully. With all the facts in e
its possession, this government expects t;
to reach a harmonious understanding p
on the subject with that of AustrbÂ­ n
Hungary, notwithstanding the renewÂ­ a
ed claim of the latter after learning b
the result of the trial for indemnity o
for its injured subjects. n
Despite the brief time alloted for preÂ­ i
paratioil, the exhibits of this country tl
at the universal exposition at Brussels t
in 1897 enjoyed the singular distinction s
of a larger proportion of awards, havÂ­ a
7 ing regard to the number of classes of
r articles entered, than those of other g
countries. The worth of such a result ii
s
in making known our national capacity ii
Y to supply the world's markets is obÂ­ e
vious. h11
]Exhibitions of this international a
"" character are becoming more frequent t
as exchanges of commercial relations g
increase. Hardly a year passes that h
this government is not invited to naÂ­ p
tional participation at some important s
- foreign center, ,but often on too short it
notice to permit to apply to congress b
for power and means to do so. My n
predecessors have suggested the advisÂ­ g
ability of providing by a general enÂ­ t
actment a standing appropriation for lI
e accepting such invitations, and for a
representation of this country by a F
commission. This, plan has my corÂ­ is
dial approval. t
I trust the Belgian restriction upon n
the importations' of cattle from the t:
1 Uiited States, originally adopted as a is
sanitary precaution, will at an early e
date be modified as to their present n
and future hardship and' discriminaÂ­ t
tion, so as to admit live cattle under e
due regulation and their slaughter afÂ­ t:
ter landing. I am hopeful, too, of a p
favorable condition in the Belgian t;
treatment of our preserved and salted tj
meats. The growth of direct trade beÂ­ Â«
tween the two countries, not alone for u
Belgian consumption and Belgian pro -
r ducts, but by way of transit from and v
to other continental states,. has been e
both encouraging and beneficial. No s
effort will be spared to enlarge its adÂ­ p
vantages by seeking the removal of n
needless impediments and by arrangeÂ­ t
ments for increased comme ci:i t
changes.
The Year's Events Iii Central America.
The year's events in Central AmeriÂ­ r
ca deserve more than passing mention. v
A menacing rupture between NicarÂ­ te
agua and Costa Rica was happily comÂ­ d
Sposed by the signature of a convention fl
between the parties, with the concurÂ­ g
rence of the Guatemalan representaÂ­
1 tive as mediator, the act being negoÂ­
tiated and signed aboard the United
SStates steamer Alert, then lying in ii
Central American waters. It is 'believÂ­ iT
ed that the good offices' of our envoy eO
and the commander of that vessel conÂ­ f
tributed to that gratifying outcome. ti
Tn my Inst mpeaCome the Ritnntion e:


-was presented with respect to the dipÂ­ ca
lomatic representation of this governÂ­ i2
ment in Central America, created, by P
the association of' Nicaragua, HonÂ­ u
duras and Salvador, under the title of 31
the Greater Republic of .Central AmerÂ­ I2
ica and the delegation of their interÂ­ e'
3
national functions to the diet thereof. a
While the representative character of a
the diet was recognized by my predeÂ­ c0
censor and has been confirmed during ri
t
my administration by receiving its g
accredited envoy and granted exequaÂ­ el
tors to corisuls coming under its auÂ­ rE
I
thority, that recognition was qualified st
by the distinct sovereign republics toÂ­ tE
ward the United States are made wholÂ­ c<
ly unaffected. This, proviso was needÂ­ T
ful, inasmuch as the compact of the B
1 three republics was at the outset an L
association Whereby certain represenÂ­ B
-
tative functions were delegated to a to
-
triparte commission, rather than a a
federation possessing centralized si
A powers of government and adminÂ­ ir
istration. In this view of the relation a
of the United States to the several reÂ­ b,
publics, a change in the representation tl
of this country in Central America rE
was neither recommended by the exÂ­ vi
ecutive or initiated by congress, thus W
leaving one of our envoys accredited, al
as heretofore, separately to two states ea
-
of the greater republic, Nicaragua and tr
e
Salvador, and to a third state, Costa am
SRica, which was not a party to the of
i
compact, while our other envoy was ti
similarly accredited to the union statÂ­ w
ed .as Honduras-and a non-union sE
stated as Guatemala. The result has a]
-been that the one has presented creÂ­ st
dentials only to the president of Costa in
]Rica, the other having been received to
only by the government of Kuatemala. to
Subsequently, the three associated Pn
republics entered into negotiations for fa
making, the steps forecast in the origÂ­ w
] inal compact. A convention of their se
;delegates framed for them a federal cc
constitution under .the name of the tt
United States of Central America and ax
Sproviding
for a central federal governÂ­ m
ment and legislature. Upon ratificaÂ­ vi
Ition
by constituent states, the first of of
November last was fixed for the new di
i
system to go into operation. Within a ce
few weeks thereafter, the plan was in
l
severely tested by revolutionary moveÂ­ iz
L
ments arising, with a consequent deÂ­ 18
I mand for unity of action upon the part be
of the. military power of the federal m
sta tes to suppress them. Under this in
strain the new union seems to have in
1:,ecn weakened through the withdrawÂ­ la
ai of its more important measures. in
This government was not officially adÂ­ ca


is Vised of the instillation of the federaÂ­
;e
tion and, has mafitained an attitude
- of friendly expectancy, while in no
3,
wise relinquishing the position held
it from the outset that the' irsponsibility
of the several states toward its reÂ­
)e
mained unaltered by. their tentative
tÂ­
relations among themselves.
Nicaragua Canal.
Le
The Nicaraguan canal commission,
under the chairmanship of Rear AdÂ­
;e
miral John G. Walker, appointed July
n 24, 1897, under the authority of a proÂ­
vision in the sundry civil act of June
is
4 of that year, has nearly completed
its labors and the results of its exÂ­
- haustive inquiry into the proper route,
ar
the feasibility and the cost of conÂ­
y. struction of an inter-oceanic canal by
is a Nicaraguan route, will be laid before
tÂ­
you. ;In the performance of its work
the commission received all possible
courtesy and assistance from the govÂ­
ernments of
, Nicaragua and Costa
Rica, which thus testified their appreÂ­
1Â­
ciation of
the importance of giving a
speedy and practical outcome to the
Ld
project that has for so many years enÂ­
is
grossed the attention of the respective
!d
countries.
te
As the scope of the recent inquiry
- embraced the whole subject, with the
is
aim of making plans and surveys for
1e
a canal by the most convenient route,
.n it necessarily'included a review of the
,n results of previous surveys and plans,
d and in particular those adopted by the
Y,
Maritime Canal company under its exÂ­
s. isting concessions from Nicaragua and
le
Costa Rica, so that to this extent
te
these grants necessarily held an esÂ­
e, sential part in the deliberations and
it conclusions of the canal commission
id
as they have held and must needs hold
)r
in the discussion of the matter by conÂ­
?r
gress. Under these circumstances and
.g
in view of overtures made to the govÂ­
le
ernments of Nicaragua and Costa RiÂ­
ie
ca by other parties for a new canal
w concession, predicated on the assumÂ­
e.
ed approaching lapse of the contracts,:
>f
of the Maritime Canal company with
rd
those states, I have not hesitated to
n express my convictions that consideraÂ­
ts
tions of expediency and international
Lg
policy, aS between the several governÂ­
- ments interested in the construction
and control of an inter-oceanic canal
.g
by this route, require the maintenance
y of the status quo, until the canal comÂ­
mission shall have reported and the
United States congress shall have had
y the opportunity to pass finally upor
Is
the ,whole matter during the present
n session, without prejudice by reason o'
any change in the existing conditions
f Nevertheless, it appears that thi
r government of Nicaragua, as one on
It its last sovereign acts -before mergin.
:y
its powers in those of the newly form
- ed United States of Central America
has granted an optional concession t.
it another association, to 'become effec
it
tive on the expiration of the presen
is
grant. It does not appear that survey
it have been made or what route is prd
1Â­
posed under this contingent grante:
-t
so that an examination of the feasilbil
rt
ity of its plans is necessarily not em
-s
braced in the report of the canal corn
:y mission. All these circumstances sug
gÂ­ rest the urgency of some definite ac
iÂ­
tion by congress at this session if th
ir labors of the past are to be utilize,
)r
and the linking of the Atlantic an.
a Pacific oceans by a practical waterwa
rÂ­
is to be realized. That the construe
tion of such a maritime highway i
, now more than ever indispensible t:
ie that intimate and ready inter-commun
a ication between our eastern and west
Ly ern seaboards, demanded by the an
It
nexation of the Hawaiian islands ant
tÂ­
the prospective expansion of our influ
=r
ence and commerce to the Pacific, an(
fÂ­ that our national policy now more im:
a peratively than ever, calls for its con.
n trol by this government, are proposiÂ­
d tions which I doubt not the congress
will duly appreciate and wisely act
)r
upon.
- A convention providing for the reviÂ­
.d val of the late United States and ChilÂ­
n eal claim commission and the conÂ­
'o sideration of claims which were duly
1Â­
presented to the late commission, but.
)f not considered because of the expiraÂ­
tion of the time limited for the dura.
Ii tion of the commission was signed
May 24, 1897, and has remained unacted
upon by the senate. The term therein
* fixed for effecting the exchange of
iÂ­ ratifications having elapsed, the conÂ­
r.
vention falls unless the time be exÂ­
- tended by amendment, which I am enÂ­
1Â­
deavoring to bring about with the
n friendly concurrence of the Chilean
government.
Oar Interests in China.
d 'The United States has. not been an
n indifferent spectator of the extraordÂ­
inary events transpiring in the ChinÂ­
Sest empire, whereb)y portions of its
1Â­
maritime provinces are passing under
the contr61 of various European powÂ­
n ers, but the Drosnect that the not


commerce with the energy of our citÂ­
izens and the necessity of our staple
y productions for Chinese uses has built
iÂ­
up in those regions may be not preÂ­
>f
jtdiced through any exclusive treatÂ­
mc.nt oy tnhe new occupants has obviatÂ­
edi tne need of our country becoming
f.
an actor in the scene. Our position
>f
among nations having a large Pacific
-coast and a constantly expanding diÂ­
g rect trade with the farther Orient,
:s
gives us the equitable claim to considÂ­
eration and friendly treatment in this
regard and it will be my aim to subÂ­
d serve our large interests in that quarÂ­
ter ,by all means appropriate to the
constant policy of our government.
The territories of Kiao-Chou, of WeiÂ­
.e Hai-'Wei and of Port Arthur and Ta
n
Lien Wan, leased to Germany, .Great
1Â­
Britain and Russia respectively for
a terms of years will, .it is announced,
a add to international commerce during
d such occupation and if no discriminatÂ­
_Â­ ing treatment of American citizens
n and their trade be found to exist or
be hereafter developed the desire of
n this government would appear to be
a realized. In this relation, showing the
volume and value of our exchanges
s with China and the peculiarly favorÂ­
i,
able conditions which exist for their
Ã½s
expansion in the normal course of
d trade, I refer to the communication
a
addressed to the speaker of the house
e of representatives by the secretary of
s the treasury on the 14th of last June,
with its accompanying letter from the
n
secretary of state, recommending an
s appropriation for a commission to
- study the growing industrial conditions
a
in the Chinese empire and report as
d to the opportunities for and obstacles
L. to the enlargement of markets in ChiÂ­
d
na for the raw products and manuÂ­
r facturer of the United States. Action
- was not taken thereon during the latt
r session. I cordially urge that the reÂ­
1 commendation receive at your hands
e the consideration which its importance
I and timeliness merit. Meanwhile, there
- may be just ground for disquietude, in
- view of the unrestrained revival of the
f old sentiment of opposition and prejuÂ­
r
dice to alien people which pervades
a
certain of the Chinese provinces. As
s in the case of the attacks upon our citÂ­
- izens in Scechuan and at Kutien in
- 1885 the United States minister has
t been instructed to secure the fullest
1 measure of protection, both local and
s
imperial, for any menace of American
e
interests and to demand in case of
lawless injury to persons or property,
instant reparation appropriate to the
case. Warships have been stationed





at Tien Tsin for more ready observaÂ­ tl
tidn of the disorders which have .inÂ­ c
vadedl even the Chinese, capital, so as n
to be in a position to act, should need
arise, while a guard of marines has 1.
,been sent to Pekifig to afford the minÂ­ h
ister the same measure of authoritaÂ­ fi
tive protection. as, the representatives h
of other nations have been constrainÂ­ o
ed to employ. a
Following close upon the rendition of p
the award of my predecessor as arhiÂ­ (1
trator of the claim of the Italian subÂ­ s
ject Cerruti against the republic of '
Colombia, differences arose between a
the parties to the arbitration in regard ii
to the scope and extent of the award, i
of which certain articles were contestÂ­ r
ed by Colombia, while Italy claimed c
their literal fulfillment. The award b
having been made ,by the president of f
the United States as an act of friendÂ­ t
ly consideration and with the sole view e
to an impartial composition of the a
matter in dispute, ,I could not but feel v
concern at such a miscarriage and, a
while unable to accept the Colombia S
theory that I, in my official capacity, h
possessed continuing function as a.rbiÂ­ ii
trator with power to interpret or reÂ­ e
vise the terms of the award, my best f<
efforts were lent in bringing the parÂ­ 1i
ties to a harmonious agreement as to d
the execution of its provisions. A naÂ­ P
val demonstration by Italy resulted in
an .engagement to, pay the liabilities
claimed upon their ascertainment but
this apparent disposition of the conÂ­ h
troversy was followed, by a rupture of f
diplomatic intercourse between ColomÂ­ P
'bia and Italy, which still continues, alÂ­ t
though fortunately without acute S
symptoms Having supervened. NotÂ­ 'F
withstanlding this, efforts are reported f
to be continuing for the ascertainment t
of Colombia's contingent liability on c
account of the Cerruti debt, under the n
fifth article of the award. o
A claim of an American citizen a
against the Domingo republic for a d
public bridge over the Ozami river, I
which has been in diplomatic conÂ­ t
troversy for several years, has been
settled by expert arbitration and an s
award in - favor of the claimant s
amounting to about $90,000. It, howÂ­ I
ever, remains unpaid, despite urgnct C
demands for its settlement according to t
the terms of the compact.
The Paris Exposition. (
There is now every prospect that the r
articipation of the! United States in (
he universal exposition to be held in o
Â·aris in 1900 will be on a scale commenÂ­ d
urate with the advanced position held a
'y our products and industries in the t
vorld's chief markets. 1P
The preliminary report of Mloses P. 1
Tandy, who, under the act approved 0
uly 19, 1897, was appointed special 1
ornmissioner with a view of securing I
11 attainable information necessary to
full and complete understanding by
ongress in regard to the porticipation I
f this government in the Paris expoÂ­ I
ition, was laid before you by my mesÂ­ <
age of Dec. 6, 1897, and shows the large
pportunities to make known our naÂ­
onal progress in art. science and I
lanufacturos, as well as the urgent
eed, of immediate and adequate proÂ­
isions to enable due advantage thereÂ­ t
f to be taken. Mr. Handy's death r
:,on afterwards rendered it necessary i
,r another to take up a0(nd cromplete
.is unfinished work, and on Jan. ii,
x98. Mr. Thomas Wt. Cridler, third asÂ­
istant secretary of state. was desirÂ­
rated to fultfill that task. His renort r
':as laid before you by my message of
tune 14, 1898, with the gratifying reÂ­
ult of awakening renewed interest in
,he projected display. B3y a provision 1
n the sundry civil appropriation act I
if July 1, 1.SS, a sum not to exceed
M650,000 was alloted for the organizaÂ­ 1
tion of a commission to care for the i
proper preparation, and installation of I
American exhibits and for the display
of suitable exhibits by the several exe -.1
cutive departme ats, particularly by
the department cf agriculture, the fish
commission and the Smithsonian InÂ­
stitution, in the representation of the
government of the United States. PurÂ­
suant to that enactment, I appointed t
Mr. Ferdinand W. Peck of Chicago
commissioner general, with an assisÂ­
tant commissioner general and secreÂ­
tary. Mr. Peck at once proceeded to I
Paris, where his success in enlarging l
the scope and variety of the Unitedc
States' exhibit has been most gratifyÂ­ I
ing. Notwithstanding the comparaÂ­
tively limited area of the exposition
site-less than one-half that qf the
WVorld's fair at Chicago-the space asÂ­
signed to the United States has been
increased from the absolute allotment
of 157,401 sqcluare feet, reported by Mr.1
Hiandy, to some 202.000 square feet, with
corresplonding augmentation of the
field for a truly characteristic reDpre
sentation of the various branches od
our country's develolpment. Mr. Peck's
report wlill be laid before you. Iii m I


.LUs w.. u, recomnencations will
call for your early consideration and
especially as regards an increased apÂ­
plropriati, n to at least 41,000,000 in all,
so that not only may the assigned
space be fully taken up by the best posÂ­
Bible 'exhibit in every elgss, but the
preparation and installation be of such
perfect scale as to rank among the
first in that unparalleled competition of
artistic and inventive production, and
thus counterbalance the disadvantage
w\ith which xwe start as compared with
other countries whose appropriations
are on a more generous scale and
whose preparations are in a state of
much greater forwardness than our
Sow n.,
Where our artisans have the adÂ­
rnittect capacity to excel, where our inÂ­
ventive genius has initiated many of
the grandest discoveries of the later
days of the century, and where the naÂ­
tive resources of our land are as limilÂ­
less as they are valuable to supply the
world's needs it is our province, as it
should be our earnest care. to Ieor i-s,
the march of hulman pror.re-s anti not

The commercial arrangements made
witil, France on May 28, 1S98, under the
provisions of section i, of the tariff
act of 1897 xwent into effect on June 1.
following. It has relieved a portion of
our export trade from serious embarÂ­
rassmernt. Further negotiations are
now pending under section 4 of the
same act, with a. view to the increase
.of trade between the two countries to
thteir mutual advantage. Negotiations
with other governments in part interÂ­
rupted with the war with Spain under
both sections of the tariff act are in
progress. 1 hope to be able to anÂ­
falounce some of the results of these neÂ­
gotiations during the present session of
.congre-s.
German Tnspeetion and Prohibition.
Negotiations to the same end with
.Germany have been set on foot. MeanÂ­
while no effort has been relaxed to
,convince the imperial government of
the thoroughness of our inspection of
pork and products for exportation and
it is trusted that the efficient adminisÂ­
tration of this measure by the departÂ­
m`ent of agriculture will be recognized
as a guarantee of the healthfulness of

 the food staples we send
. abroad to. in.
countries where their use is large and. tic
necessary.
I transmitted to the senate, on Fe,. tw
10 last, information touching the proÂ­ of
hibition against the importation
â€¢ of es+
fresh fruits from this country, which p1
had been recently decreed ,by .Germany of
on the ground of danger of disseminÂ­ so
ating the San Jose; scale insect. This of
f
precautionary measure was justified by
-Germany
on the score of the drastic ret
steps taken in several, states of the tic
Eunion
against the spread ,.cf the pese TU
and the dlanger to Gerinanfruit growÂ­ tr.
I ing interests should the scale obtain a tic
lodgment in that country. Temporary su
relief was afforded in the case of large co
I
consignments of fruitsÂ­ then on the way n1
by inspection and admission' when St
f
found non-infected. Later the prohibiÂ­ ta
tion xwas extended: to dried fruits of in
every kind, but was relaxed so as to W
apply only to unpeeled fruit and fruit co
wI aste. As was to be expected the 1""e
alarm reached to other countries and ir

has adopted a similar inÂ­

Ri., ,lhniu With Great Britain. in
Our relations with Great Britain er
have continued on the most friendly sl
footing. Assenting to our request, the or
iprotection of Americans and their inÂ­
terests in Spanish jurisdiction was asÂ­
stred by the diplomatic and consular
representatives of Great Britain who
fulfilled their delicate and arduous D
trust with tact and zeal, eliciting high th
commendation. I may )be allowed to gc
make fitting allusion to the instance to
of Mr. Ramsden, her majesty's consul iC
at Santiago de Cuba, whose untimely C
death after distinguished service and in
cuntiring efforts during the siege of ti
that city was sincerely lamented. in
In the early part of April last, pur""Â­ e
suant to a request made at the inÂ­ di
stance of the secretary of state to the tl
British ambassador at this capital, the ci
Canadian government granted facili t
ties for the passage of the United T
States revenue cutters from the lakes e
to the Atlantic coast, by way of the ti
Canadian canal and the St. Lawrence ac
river. The vessels had reached Laket c
Ontario and were there awaiting the IC
opening of navigation when war was i""
declared between the United States
and Spain. Her majesty's government
thereupon, by a communication of the ti

c Annexation of Hawaii.
Pondting the consideration by the senÂ­ 1
ate of the treaty signed June 16, 18., vi
by the plenipotentiaries of the United is
States and the republic of Hawaii, proÂ­ tl
riding for the annexation of the island, rr
Â·a joint resolution to accomplish the 01
same purpose by accepting the offered c'
cession and incorporating the ceded s
terriiitory into the union, was adopted v
by the congress and' anorovecd .lilv 7


18S8. I thereupon directed the United tt
States steamer Philadelphia. to convey Si
Rear Admiral Miller to Honolulu ant je
entrusted to his hands: this important ni
legislative active to be delivered to nm
the president of the republic of Hawaii, m
,with whom the admiral was authorizÂ­ cc
ed to make appropriate arrangements
for transferring the sovereignty of
the islandsl to the United States. This
w\as simply but impressively accomÂ­ m
plished on the 12th day of August last, m
by the delivery of a certified copy or
g'
the resolution to President Dole, who cE
d
thereupon yielded up to the represenÂ­ T
tative of the government of the United ft
States the sovereignty and the propÂ­ ci
erty cf the Hawaiian islands. Pt
Pursuant to the terms of the joint tl
resolution and in exercise of authority ti
thereby conferred upon me, I directed st
that the civil, judicial and military ct
powers theretofore exercised by the ofÂ­ fr
ficers of the government of the repu'bÂ­ 18
e lie of Hawaii sihould continue to be exÂ­ cc
t ercised by those officers until congress 9g
shall provide a government for the inÂ­ ti
corporated territory, subject to my ""E
pcwer to remove such oflicers and to ol
fill vacancies. The president, officers ec
and troops of the republic thereupon tn
took the oath of allegiance to the pi
United States, thus providing for the si
uninterrupted continuance of all the iln
administrative and municipal funcÂ­ e:
tions of the annexed territory until
w
congress shall otherwise enact.
e Following the further provision of tl
the joint resolution I appointed the si
SI-lonorables Shelby A. Cullom of IlliÂ­
- nois, John T. Morgan of Alabama, ai
Robert it. Hitt of Illinois, Sanford B. Y'
Dole of Hawaii and Walter F. Grier of In
Hawaii as commissioners to confer ti
and recommend to congress such legisÂ­ I)
lo ation concerning the Hawaiian islands eC
as they should deem necessary or t!
proper. The commissioners, having
c,
fuifilled the mission confided to them, R'
n their report will be laid before you at C
an early day. It is 'believed that their s'
recommendations will have the earnÂ­ o0
est consideration due to the magnitude
of the responsibility resting upon you tl
to give such shape to the relationship to
of those mid-Pacific lands to our home fi
-ii union as will benefit both in the highÂ­ ci
est degree, realizing the aspira.tions of 1i

,f tical heritage while, at the same timet, I

justifying the foresight of those who rI""e
sÂ­
for three-quarters of a century have p
tÂ­ looked to the assimilation of Hawaii it

y Under the provisions, of the joint St
e resolution, the existing customs relaÂ­ an
e tions of the Hawaiian islands with the Do
I United States and with other counÂ­ to

suls of Hawaii, here and in foreign

- The attention of congress is called in
co
to the fact that our consular officers ty
_ having ceased to exist in 'Hawaii, and Sy

'e coming under the sovereignty of the pc

3
relief and transportation of destitute on
American seamen in these countries. U1

- Extradition Laws Need Revision. a
The interpretation of certain proviÂ­ qt
i, ions of the extradition convention of in
Dec. 11, 1861, has been a.t various times ci
the occasion of controversy with the tÂ­
o government of Mexico. An acute difÂ­ ar
ference arose in the case of the MexÂ­ w
ican dem~and for the delivery of Jesus be
y Guerrerar, who, having led a maraudÂ­ to
d ing expedition near the 'border with je
the proclaimed purpose of initiating
insurrection against President Diaz, so
escaped into the United, States. ExtraÂ­ ci
dition was refused on the ground' that pi
the alleged offense was political in its of
character and therefore came within tÂ­
the treaty proviso of non-surrender. e)
d The Mexican contention was that the w
exception only related to purely poliÂ­ pi
tical offenses andÂ­ that as Guerrera's m
e acts were. admixed with the common 27
crime of murder, arson, kidnaping and he
ie
robbery, the option 'of non-delivery oa
became void, a position which this (w
government was unable to admit, in to
it view of the received international docÂ­ bi
le
trine and practice in the matter. The c,
1e
Mexican government, in view of this, M
it gave Jiotice on Jan. 24, 1898, of the terÂ­ in
mination of the convention, to take efÂ­ it
fect 12 months from that date at the A
el same time inviting the conclusion of a ti
convention towardc which negotiations
i
are on foot. di
In this relation I may refer to the ti
1Â­
necessity of some amendment of our ""1
existing extradition statutes. It is a at
common stipulation of such treatic Si
Sthat neither party shall be bound to a,
give up its own citizens, with the added tl:
a proviso in one of our treaties, that to
with Japan, that it may surrender it ci
it it sees fit. It is held in this' country h'
It by an almost uniform course of deci - A
Ssins, that where a treaty negatives d
the obligation' to surrender, the p)resiÂ­ h
cdent is not invested with legal authorÂ­ to
ity to act. The confirmation of such ti
authority would be in the direction of m
that sound miora.ity which shrinks of
th from affording secure asylum to the hi
it. author of a heinous crime. ai
ly Again, statutory provision might tl
ir well be made for what is styled extraÂ­ w
at
dition by way of transit, whereby a fuÂ­ t
or
gitive surrendered by one foreign govÂ­
tit ernment to another may be conveyed sc
itacross the territory of the United bi
n States to the jurisdiction of the deÂ­ al
s_ manding state. A recommendation in a'
.3 this behalf, made in the president's w'
i. message of 1886, was not acted upon. fr

International Red Crogp.
, Immediately upon 'the outbreak of

has demservedly assumed as the patronl
of the International lRed Cross, proÂ­
posed to the United States and Spain
that they should severally recognB:e
and carry into execution as a md;ias
vivendi during the continuance of hosÂ­
tilities the additional articles proposed
hby the international confeie sle at CerÂ­
eva, Octosber 6, 1868, extending the e.Â­
fects of the existing Red Cross cln\'Ven.l
tion of 1864 to the conduct of naval
Swarfare.

ISFrance and) Germiany in 1870O in adopl~tÂ­


d of the accession of the United States

though the exchange or ratification
thereof sltill remained uneffected, the

This government feels a keen satisÂ­
faction in having thus been enabled
to testify its adherence to the broad
pr inciile of humanity even amidst the

it that the extension of the Red 'Cross
compact to hostilities by sea as well

strument of the wise purposes of its
founders and is receiving the cordial
support of the contributing members
of the international union which are
actually represented in the board of
management. A commercial directory
in two volumes cotnaining a mass of
statistical matter, descriptive of the
industrial and commercial interests of
the various countries, has been printÂ­
ed in English, Spanish, Portuguese and
German and a monthly pudbiication in
'these four languages and' distributed
in, the Latin-American countries as
I
well as in the United States has 'proved
to ,be a valua!ble medium for diseminÂ­
ating information and furthering the
varied, interests of international union.

such data before the public with 'the

v'ce thus supplied to our merchants

'The experiences of 'the last year
Ihring forcibly home to us a sense of
Sthe burdens and the waste of war. We
I 'esire, in common with most civilized
nations, to reduce to the lowest posÂ­
sible point the damages sustained in
e
time of war 'by peaceable trade and
commerce. It is 'true 'we
may suffer
aIin such cases less than other comÂ­
t
munities, 'but all nations are damaged
Mt
ore or less by the state of uneasiÂ­
-ecs and apprehension into which at
t
the outbreak of hostilities throws the
1
-ntire commercial world. It should be
m
our object, therefore, 'to nm'nimize, so
far as practicable, this inevitable loss
mand disturbance. Thi:s purpose can
p rc:bably be best accomplished by an
:nternational agreement to regard'
all
I'rivate property at sea as exempt
from, capture or destruction by the
forces, of belligerent powers. The
United
- States government has for
many years advocated this humane
and beneficent principle and is now
I
in ,position to recommend it to other
1
'powers without the imputation of selfÂ­
ish motives. I therefore suggest for
consideration that the executive he
auÂ­
thcrized to correspond with the govÂ­
ernmen'ts of principal maritime powÂ­
ers with a view of incorporating into
the permanent law of civilized nations
,the principle of the exemption of all
private property at sea, not contraÂ­

expenditures to $443,368,582. There was
c;btained' from customn $149,575,062 and
from internal revenue $170,900,641. Our
dutliable imports amounted, to $324.735.Â­


479, a decrease of $58,156,690 over the
preceding year and importations free
of du-ty amounted to $291,414,175, a deÂ­
crease from the preceding year of $90,Â­
524,068. Internal revenue recei:pts exÂ­
ceeded those of the preceding year by
$24,212,068. The total 'tax collected on
distilled snirits was $92,546,9999; on
manufactured tobacco, $36,230,522, and

The Monitor, a newspaper published at
Meadford, Ont., Canada, first discovered
this case two years ago, and published
it 'at length, which now seems, owing to
the cure of it, to be a miracle. The facts
were :so remarkable 'that many people
doubted the truth of 'them. They said:
""It is Itoo remarkable; it cannot possibly
be true; 'the paper is mistaken, and the
man, although h1e may think himself
cured, will soon relapse into his former
condition,"" etc., etc. The accuracy of its
report called in question, the Monitor deÂ­
termined ,to find out definitely whether
the facts were as stated and whether the
man would really stay cured. They acÂ­
cordingly kept a close -watch on the case
for two years after the first artiÂ­
cle appeared, and have just now pubÂ­
lished another article about it in which

the original reports are conmpletel
verified. the cure is permanent, :an(l
they publish a fac simile of i.he check
given: by the Canadian Mutual Life
Association for $1,650.00 amount of
total disability claim paid by the:a
to Mr. Fetch.
The first a.count stated that the patient
(see address below) had been a paralytic
for five years, that there' was such a
total lack of feeling in his limbs and body
.that 'a pin run full length could not be
felt; that he could not walk or help himÂ­
self at all; for two years he was not
dressed; furthermore that he was
bloated, ,as for 'that reason almost unÂ­
recognizaole, and could not get his
clothes on. The paralysis was so coinÂ­
plete as to affect the face and prevented




 him from opening his mouth sufficiently
wide to take solid food. The doctors
called the disease spinal sclerosis, and
all said he could not live.
For three years he lingered in 'this conÂ­
di'tion. Then by some friends he was
advised to take Dr. Williams' Pink Pills
for Pale People. HIe 'took them, and
there was a slight change. The first
thing noted was a tendency to sweat
freely. This showed 'there 'was some life
left in his helpless body. Next came a
little feeling in his limbs. This extendÂ­
ed, followed by pricking sensations,
until at last ithe blood began to course
freely, naturally and vigorously through
his body, and the helplessness gave way
to returning strength, the ability to walk
returned, and he 'was restored 'to his oldÂ­
time healith.





The above is the substance of the first al
article published by the Monitor. Now r
follow some clippings, taken from the 1
same paper two years afterward, and
there is not the slightest shadow of a
doubt, in view of this testimony, that Mr.
Petch's cure is permanent. 'Here folÂ­
lows the account:
Or. being again questioned, Mr. Petch
said: ""You see those hands-the skin is t
now natural1 and elastic. Once they I
were hard and without sensation. You s
could pierce them with a pin and I would
not feel it, and what is true of my hands
3 is true of the rest of my 'body. Perhaps t
you have observed that I have now even 1
ceased 'to use a cane, and can get about i
my business perfectly well. You may
I say 'there is absolutely no doubt as to I




 my cure being permanent., Indeed I ara
in even better health than when I gave
you the first interview.""
""Do you still attribute your cure to
the use of Dr. Williams' Pink Pills?""
asked the Monitor.
""Unquestionably I do,"" was :the reply.
""Doctors had failed, as had also the
numerous remedies recommended by ny
friends. Nothing I t'ook had the slightÂ­
est effect upon me until I began the use
of Dr. Williams' Pink Pills. To this
wonderful medicine I owe my release
from the living death.. I have since recÂ­
ommended these pills to many of my
friends, and the verdict is always in their
favor. I shall always bless the day I
was induced to take 'them.""
Such is the history of one of the mnost
remarkable cases of modern times. Can





any 'one say, in 'the face of such testlÂ­
moinv. that Dr"". Williams' Pink Pills are
not entitled to the careful consideration
of any suffering man, woman or child?
Is not 'the case in truth 'a miracle of modÂ­
ern medicine?
To make the evidence complete we
publish above. a fac simile, cut of the
check received by Mr. Petch from the
Canadian Mutual Life Association, being
the amount due him for total disability.
It is unnecessary to add that this life inÂ­
surance association did not pay this large
amount of money to Mr. Petch except
after 'the most careful examination of
his condition by their medical experts.
They must have regarded him as forever
incurable.

BEWARE OF MORPHINE

Mrs. Pinkham's Urgent Appeal to
Suffering Women.

She Asks Them to Seek Permanent Cures and
Not Mere Temporary Relief From Pain.

Special forms of suffering lead many a woman to acquire the morÂ­
phine habit.
One of these forms of suffering is a dull, persistent pain in the
side, accompanied by heat and throbbing. There is disinclination.'
to work, becausc work only increases the pain.

This is only one symptom of a chain oil
troubles she has others she cannot bear to
confide to her physician, for fear of
an examination, the terror of all sen- I
sitive, modest women. I

The physician, meantime, knows
her condition, but cannot combat her
shrinking terror. He yields to her
supplication for something to relieve
the pain. He gives her a few morÂ­
phine tablets, with very grave cauÂ­
tion as to their use. Foolish woÂ­
manl She thinks morphine will
help her right along she becomes its slave!

zE-7

A wise and a generous physician had such
a case he told his patient he could do nothing
for her, as she was too nervous to undergo
an examination. In despair, she went to
visit a friend. She said to her, Don't give
yourself up just go to the nearest druggist's
and buy a bottle of Mrs. Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound.
It will build you up. You will begin to feel better with the first,
bottle."" She did so, and after the fifth bottle her health was re*
established. Here is her own letter about it:
""I was very miserable was so weak that I'
could hardly get around the house, could not do
any work without feeling tired out. My monthly,
periods had stopped and I was so tired and nervÂ­
ous all of the time. I was troubled very much with
falling of the womb and bearing-down pains. A
friend advised me to take Lydia E. Pinkham's

We have probably all of us met with

Never use a lady's name in improper

company. Never make assertions about
her that you think untrue, or allusions
that you think she herself would blush
to hear. When you meet with men who
do not scruple to make use of a woman's
name in a reckless and unprincipled
manner, shun themâ€”they are the very
worst members of the communityâ€”men
lost to every sense of honor, every feelÂ­

repeated where it should not have been,

A slander is soon propagated, and the
smallest thing derogatory to a woman's
character will fly on the wings of the

til its monstrous weight crushes the poor
ifhconscious victim. Respect the name
of woman ; your mother and sisters are
women, and as yon would have their
fair name untarnished, arid their lives
unembittered by the slanderer's bitter
tongue, heed the ill your own words
may bring upon the mother, the sister,

(International Press Association Service.)

Washington, D. C., Dec. 17.â€”President
Cleveland this morning sent to congress
the following message on the VeneÂ­
zuelan dispute

To the congress: tft Bay annual mesÂ­
sage addressed to the congress on the
Sd
instant,

I

catted attention to the

pending botthdary controversy between
Great Britain and the republic of VenÂ­
esuete recited the substance of a
representation made by this governÂ­
ment to her Britannic majesty's governÂ­
ment, suggesting reasons why such disÂ­
pute should be submitted to arbitration
for settlement anjl Inquiring whether
It would be so submitted. The answer
of the British government, which was
then awaited, has since been received,
and, together with the dispatch to which
It Is a reply, Is hereto appended. Such
reply Is embodied in two communicaÂ­
tions addressed by the British prime
minister to Sir Julian Pauncefote, the
British ambassador at this capital.

It will be seen that one of these comÂ­
munications is devoted exclusively to
observations upon the Monroe doctrine
and claims that In the present Instance
anew and strange extension and develÂ­
opment of this doctrine is insisted upon
by the United States, that the reasons
justifying an appeal to the doctrine
enunciated by President Monroe are
generally inapplicable to a controversy
involving the boundary line between
Gre&t Britain and Venezuela.

Without attempting extended arguÂ­
ments In reply to these positions It may
not be amiss to suggest that the docÂ­
trine upon which we stand is strong and
sound because its enforcement is imporÂ­
tant to our peace and safety as a naÂ­
tion and is essential to the integrity of
our free institutions and the tranquil
maintenance of our distinctive form of
government. It was intended to apply
to every stage of our national life and
cannot become obsolete while, our reÂ­
public endures. If the balance of power
Is justly a cause for jealous anxiety
among the governments of the old world
and a subject for our absolute non-inÂ­
terference, none the less is an observÂ­
ance of the Monroe doctrine of vital
concern to our people and their governÂ­
ment.

Applicable to Present Time.

Assuming, therefore, that we may
properly insist upon this doctrltfe withÂ­
out regard to ""the state of things in
which we live,"" or any changed condiÂ­
tions here or elsewhere. It is not apÂ­
parent why its application may n-t be
invoked in the present controversy. If
a European power, by an extension or
its boundaries, takes possession of the
territory of one of our neighboring reÂ­
publics against its will and in derogaÂ­
tion of its rights, it Is difficult to see
why, to that extent, such European
power does not thereby attempt to exÂ­
tend its system of government to that
portion of this continent which Is thus
taken. This ts the precise action which
President Monroe declared to be ""danÂ­
gerous to our peace and safety,"" and it
can make no difference whether the EuÂ­
ropean system is extended by an adÂ­
vance of frontier or otherwise.

It is also suggested in the British reÂ­
ply that we sL mid not seek to apply
the Monroe doctrine to the pending disÂ­
pute because it does not embody any
principle of International law which ""is
founded On the general consent of naÂ­
tions,"" and that ""no statesman, howÂ­
ever eminent, and no nation, however
powerful, are competent to insert into
the code of International law a novel
principle which was never recognized
before and which has not since been
accepted by the government of any
other country.""

Practicaly, the principle for which we
contend has peculiar if not exclusive
relation to the United States. It may
not have been admitted In so many
words to the code of international law,
but since, in International councils
every nation is entitled to the rights beÂ­
longing to it, if the enforcement of the
Monroe doctrine Is something we may
justly claim, it has its place in the code
of international law as certainly and as
surely as if It were specifically menÂ­
tioned. and when the United States is
a suitor before the high tribunal that
administers international law the quesÂ­
tion to be determined is whether or not
we present claims which the justice of
that code of law can find to be rieht and
valid.

Monroe Doctrine It Jntt

The Monroe doctrine finds its recogniÂ­
tion in those principles of international
law which are based upon the theory
that every nation shall have its rights
protected and its just claims enforced.

Of course this government is entirely
confident that under the sanction of this
doctrine we have clear rights and unÂ­
doubted claims. Nor is this Ignored in
the British reply. The prime minister,
while not admitting that the Monroe
doctrine Is applicable to present condiÂ­
tions. states: ""In declaring that the
United States would resist any such enÂ­
terprise if it was contemplated. PresiÂ­
dent Monroe adopted a policy which reÂ­
ceived the entire sympathy of the Eng-

ur

PRESIDENT CRESPO.
(Venezuela'* Chief Executive.)

Jhffigh thi language of

President is directed to the attainment
of objects which most Englishmen
would a^ree to be salutary, It is ImposÂ­
sible to admit that they have been inÂ­
scribed by any adequate authority in
the code of international law."" Aftttltk
he says: ""They (her majesty'*
ment) fully concur with tho vt*W which
President Monroe appArefttly enterÂ­
tained, that any disturbance of the exÂ­
isting territorial distribution in that
hemisphere by any fresh acquisitions on
the part of any European state would
be a highly inexpedient change,""

In the belief that the doctrlrtft, VV
which we contend was cleÂ«V- ftttA defiÂ­
nite that it involve VViir safety
and welfare that was fully apÂ­
plicable to out- present conditions
and to this state of the world's progÂ­
ress, and that it was directly related
to the pending controversy and without
any conviction as to the final merits of
the dispute, but anxious to learn in a
satisfactory and conclusive manner
whether Great Britain sought, under ft
claim of boundary, to extend her

It will be seen from thft Correspondence
herewith submitted that this proposition
has been declined by \We. British poverr,Â­
ment, Upott gHMjWds which under the clrÂ­

of justice and to the magnaiunity of one

touching its relations to one comparativeÂ­
ly weak and small, should have produced
no better results.

The course to be pursued by this govÂ­
ernment in view of the present condition
does not^appear to admit of serious doubt.
Having labored faithfully for many years
to induce Great Britain to submit this
dispute to impartial arbitration, and havÂ­
ing been now finally apprised of her reÂ­
fusal to do so, nothing remains but to
accept the situation, to recognize Its plain
requirements, and deal with it accordÂ­
ingly.

Oreat Britain's present proposition has
never thus far been regarded as admissible
by Venezuela, though any adjustment Of
thÂ» boundary which that country may
deem for her advantage and may enter
into of her own free will can not of course
be objected to by the United States. AsÂ­
suming, however, that the attitude of
Venezuela will remain unchanged, the disÂ­
pute has reached such a stage us to make
It now Incumbent upon the United States
to take measures to determine with suffiÂ­
cient certainty ror Its justification what
Is the true divisional line between the
republic of Venezuela and Bullish Guluna.
The Inquiry to that end should of course
be conducted carefully and judicially, and
due weight should be given to all availÂ­
able evidence, records, and Tacts In supÂ­
port of the claims of both parties.

In order that such an examination
should be prosecuted in a thorough and
satisfactory manner suggest that the
congress make an adequate appropriaÂ­
tion for the expenses of a commission to
be appointed by the executive, who shall
make the necessary Investigation and reÂ­
port upon the matter with the least posÂ­
sible delay.

Must Figlit If Necessary.

When such report is made and accepted,
jt will, in my opinion, be the duty of the
United States to resist by every means in
Its power, as a willful aggression upon its
rights and Interests, the appropriation InÂ­
Great Britain of any lands, or the exercise
of governmental jurisdiction over any terÂ­
ritory which, after investigation, we have
determined of right belongs lo Venezuela.

In making these recommendations I am
fully alive to the responsibility incurred
and keenly realize all the consequences
that may follow.
1 am, nevertheless, firm in my convicÂ­
tion that while it is a grievous tiling to
contemplate the great English-speaking
peoples of the world as being otherwise
than friendly competitors In the onward
march of civilization and strenuous and
worthy rivals in all the arts of peace,
there is no calamity which a great nation
can invite which equals tiiat which folÂ­
lows a supine submission to wrong and
injustice, and the consequent loss of naÂ­
tional self-respect atnl honor, beneath
which Is shielded and defended people's
safety and greatness.

OLNEV'S NOTE OK JULV

Summarizes the Situation in the Long
Standing Dispute.
Washington, Dec. 17.â€”Accompanying
the president's message is the correÂ­
spondence on the subject. It starts with
Secretary Olney's now celebrated note reÂ­
opening the negotiations with Great
Britain looking to the arbitration of the
boundary dispute, bears date of July 20
last, and is addressed to Mr. Bayard.

The secretary begins by stating that the
president has given much anxious thought
to the subject and has not it-ached a conÂ­
clusion without a lively sense of its great
importance, as well as ol the serious posÂ­
sibility involved in any action now to be
taken, lte then comments on the long
duration of the boundary dispute, the ""inÂ­
detinlte"" claims of both parties, and the
continuous (jrowtli of the undefined BritÂ­
ish claims,"" the late of the various atÂ­
tempts at arbitration of the controversy.

summarise* the 'Situation at the beginulng
of tht* year to be as follows:
1. The title of territory of Indefinite
but confessedly very larar PKtteht Is IN
dispute between GrwU lUUtiiK Hud VeneÂ­
zuela.

tlf*

o. The controversy has existed for half
a century, despite Venezuela's efforts to
establish a boundary.
4. Veneeuela has for a quarter of a
century striven for arbltrntion,
5. Great Britain has continuously reÂ­
fused exempt upoh the renunciation In her
favor of a large part of v'eneP.uPift's
claims.
6. Thf T'nlU'ti SUUteS liUS hrtUlV clear
to UrPftt itHlulft nttd tu'e Vqrl'd by freÂ­

the Oohtr^yWr!^ is one in which its honor
nrMJ^..?Wl'eVeats are involved and the conÂ­
yWuanee of which it cannot regard with
Indifference.

This status, the secretary says, compels
those charged with the interests of the
United States ""to decide to what extent, if
any, the United States may and should inÂ­
tervene in a controversy between and priÂ­
marily concerning only Great Britain and
Vencjeilia, and to decide how far it IK bound
10 see that the Integrity of Venezuela terriÂ­
tory is not Impaired by the pretentions of Its
powerful antagonist. Are any such right
and duty devolved upon the United States?
If not, the United States has already done all.
if not more than all. that a purely nentiÂ­
mental interest In the affairs of the two
countries justifies, and to push its interposiÂ­
tion further would be unbecoming and undigÂ­
nified. and mlKht well subject It to the charge
of Impertinent mnddling with affairs with
which it has not rightful concern.
""On the other hand, if any such right and
duty exist, their true exercise and discharge
will not permit of any action that shall not
be efficient, and that, if the power of the
United States is inadequate, shall not result
in the accomplishment of the end in view.
The question thus presented, as a matter of
principle and regard being had to the settled
national policy, does not seem difficult of soÂ­
lution. Vet the momentous practical conÂ­
sequences dependent upon Its determination
require that it shold be carefully considered
and that the grounds of the conclusion arÂ­
rived at should be fully and frankly stated.""

The secretary lays it down as a canon of inÂ­
ternational law that a nation may Justly InÂ­
terpose In a controversy between other naÂ­
tions whenever ""what is done or proposed by

THE HAWAIIAN TROUBLE.
A Special Message Will Be Laid
;v.j*.;. Before Congress.
It is hardly necessary for me to state'
that the questions arisihg from our relaÂ­
tions with Hawaii bave caused serious
embarrassment.
Just prior to the installment of. the
present administration, the existing
government of Hawaii had been sudÂ­
denly overthrown and a treaty of anÂ­
nexation had been negotiated between
the provisional government of the
islands and the United States and subÂ­
mitted to the senate for ratification.
This treaty 1 withdrew for examination,
and dispatched Hon. James Blount, of
Georgia, to Honolulu as a special comÂ­
missioner to make an impartial investiÂ­
gation of the circumstances attending
the change of government aud of all the
conditions bearing upon the subject of
the treaty. After a thorough and exÂ­
haustive examination, Mr. Blount subÂ­
mitted to me his report, showing beÂ­
yond all question that the constitutional
government of Hawaii* had been subÂ­
verted with the active aid of our repreÂ­
sentative to tbat government and
through the Intimidation caused by the
presence of an armed naval force of the
United States, which was lauded ofr
that purpose at the instance for
our minister. Upon the facts developed
it seemed to me the only honorable
course for our government to pursue
was to undo the wrong that had been
done by those representing us, and to
restore as far as practicable the status
existing at the time of our forcible inÂ­
tervention. With a view of accomplishÂ­
ing this result within the constitutional
limit of executive power, and recognizÂ­
ing all our obligations and responsibilÂ­
ities growing out of any changed condiÂ­
tion brought about by our unjustifiable
interference, our present minister at
Honolulu has received appropriate inÂ­
structions to that end. Thus far no inÂ­
formation of the accompiishmeut of any
definite results has been received from
him. Additional advices are soon exÂ­
pected. ""When received they will be

ARBITRATION l'r:

By a concurrent resolution, passed by.
the senate Feb. 14, 1890, and by the
house of representatives on the 3d of
April following, the president; was . reÂ­
quested ""to invite from- time to time, as
fit occasion may arise, negotiations with
any government with which the United
States has or may have diplomatic relaÂ­
tions, to the end that any differences or
disputes arising between the two govÂ­
ernments which cannot be adjusted by
diplomatic agency may be referred 'to
arbitration, and be peaceably adjusted
by such means."" April 18, 1890, the

Washington, by resolution, expressed
the wish that all controversies between
the republics of America and the naÂ­

in that conference should communicate
this wish to all friendly powers. A
favorable response has been received

It affords me signal pleasure to lay
this parliamentary resolution before the

Since the passage of the act of March
3, 1893, authorizing the president to
raise the grade of our envoys to correÂ­
spond with the rank which foreign
countries accord to their agents here.
Great Britain, France, Italy aud GerÂ­
many have conferred upon their repreÂ­
seniatives at this capital the title of
ambassador, aud I responded by acÂ­
crediting the agents of the United
States in those countries with the same
title. A like elevation of mission is
announced by Russia, and, wheu made,
will be similarly met. This step fitÂ­
tingly comports with the position the
United States holds in the family of
nations. During my former adminisÂ­
tration I took occasion to recommend a
recast of the laws relating to the conÂ­
sular service, in order that it might
become a more efficient agency in the
promotion of the interests it was intendÂ­
ed to subserve. The duties and powers
of consuls have been expanded with the
growing requirements of j our foreigu
trade. Discharging important dutiesÂ­
affecting our commerce and American'
citizens abroad, and in certain couutries
exercising * judicial functions, these
officers should be men of character, inÂ­
telligence and ability; .-*'-

leads me to damp places. I was so bad I
could not walk, and at night I suffered fearÂ­

good and I was afraid of being a cripple. I
finally commenced using BRANDRETH'S

entirely well. Now, whenever sick, I take

50,000 strangers are in Washington.
CLEARING SKIES.

At 10:r.u this morning the sun commenced
to shine quite brightly, with a chilly M#reh
wind blowing from the northwest. .At this
hour a greater portion of the population of'
Washington arid Georgetown, were out along
the line of march, and with the strangers here,
over 100,000 persons assembled to witness the
procession. The sidewalks on Pennsylvania aye.
sue, along the route, were literally packed, and
the windows of the buildings, as well as the
stands, were crowded with spectator?.
THE PROCESSION.
ThÂ« various divisions inarched along the
avenue according to the programme, and at
11:30, the head of the procession, passing
around the south wing, reached (he eastern
front of the capitol. The Presidential carÂ­
riage was driven to the- lower entrance of the
Senate wing and the President-elect, accompaÂ­

proceeded to the Vice President's room, where
they remained till 12 o'clock. As early an 10

the platform erected over the steps leading
to the main entrance, and at 12 o'clock it was
estimated 50,000 people were massed in front

corps appeared at the main entrance, and at
once attracted universal attention, as they
filed down the center aisle in their gorgeous
court costumes, resplendent with gold and
silver embroidery, and glittering with dec_Â»â€¢
rations. Sir Edward Thornton headed the
corps as its dean; the French, Chilian and GerÂ­
man ministers followed. Then came the
Turkish minister with his red fez, and still
more conspicuously attired. The full Chinese
legation nest appeared and afforded a
fresh topic for the buzz of comment
in the galleries, alike by their grave demeanor
and tbeir red-button mandarin hats and peaÂ­
cock feathers. A few minutes afterwards the
supreme court of the United States was anÂ­
uounced and the justices, headed by Chief
Justice Waite and clad in their robes of office,
entered the chamber, and marching slowly
down the center aisle took seats prepared for

INAUGURAL ADDRESS.

At 12:35 Senator Pendletou arose and introÂ­
duced General Gavflrld, who delivered his inÂ­
augural address:
Fellow Citizens. We stand today upou
an eminence which overlooks a hundred years
of national lifeâ€”a century crowded with partis
but crowned with the triumph of liberty and
love. Before continuing the onward march
let us pause v moment at this heightâ€”for a
moment to strengthen our faith and renew
our hope by a glance at the pathway along
which our people have travelad. It is now
three days more than a hundred years since the
adoption of the first written constitution of
the United States, the articles of confederation
and perpetual union.

TIIE HEW KEITBMC
was then beset with dauger on every hand It
had not conquered n place in the family of
nations. The decisive battle of the war for
independence, whose centennial anniversary
will soon be gratefully celebrated at YorkÂ­
town, had not yet been fought. The colonists
were struggling not only against the armies
of Great Britain but against the settled opinÂ­
ions, of mankind, for the world did not believe
that""the supreme authority of government
could be safely entrusted to the guardianship
of the people themselves. We cannot overÂ­
estimate the fervent iove of liberty, the intelÂ­
ligent courage and saving common sense with
which our fathers made the great experiment
of self-government. Wheu they found after a
short time that a confederacy of the States was
too weak to meet the necessities of the vigorÂ­
ous and expanding republic, they boldly set it
aside and in its stead established

THE N'ATIOXAT. UNION,

founded directly upon all the people, endowed
with full powers of self-preservation and
with ample authority fur the accomplishment
of its great object. Under this constitution
the boundaries of freedom have been enlarged,
the foundations of order and peace been
strengthened, and growth in all the better
elements of national life has vindicated the
wisdom of the founders, and given new hope
to their descendants. Under this constitution
our people long ago made themselves safe
against danger from without, and secured for
their mariners and fine equality of rights on
all the seas. Under this constitution twentyÂ­
five States have been added to the
union, with constitutions and laws formed
and enforced by their own citizens to secure
the manifold blessings of local self-governÂ­
ment. The jurisdiction of this constitution
now covers an area fifty times greater than
tint of the original thirteen States and a popÂ­
ulation twenty times greater than that of 1780.
The supreme trial of the constitution came at
last under the tremendous pressure of civil
war. We ourselves are witnesses that the
Union emerged from the blood and fire of that
conflict purified and made stronger for all the
beneficent purposes of good government.
And now nt the close of this,

rnr: first oentcry
of growth, with the- inspirations oi its history
In their hearts, our people have lately reviewed
the condition of the nation, passed judgment
upon the coudiict and opinions of political
parties, aud have registered ""their will concernÂ­
ing the future administration of the governÂ­
ment, aud to interpret and execute that will iv
accordance with the constitution, is the paraÂ­
mount duty of the executive.

FRCIT3 OF THE W.in.

Evrn from this point of view it is manifest
that the nation is resolutely facing to the
front, resolved te occupy its vast energies in
developing the great possibilities of the fuÂ­
ture. Sacredly preserving whatever has b< en
gained to liberty and good government during
the century, our people .are determinÂ­
ed to leave behind all those bitÂ­
ter controversies concerning things
which have been Irrevocably settled and
further discussion of whickcan only stir up
strife aud delay the onwanT march. Th^ suÂ­
premacy of the natiou and its laws should be
no longer a subject of debate. That discusÂ­
sion which for half a century threatened the
existence of the Union was closed at the last
court of war by a decree from which there is
no appeal. The constitution and laws made in
pursuance thereof shall continue to be the suÂ­
preme law of the land, binding alike upon
States and the people. This decree does aot
disturb any of the States nor interfere with
any of their necessary rules of local self govÂ­
ernment, but it does fix and establish the perÂ­
manent supremacy of the Union. The will of
the nation, speaking with the voice, of battle
and through the amended constitution, has
fulfilled the great promise of 177^Â»bv proÂ­
claiming liberty throughout the land to all
inhabitants therein.

THE NEGRO I!ACE.

The c-levatlon of the negro race, from sluvÂ­
eiy to full rights of citizenship, is the
most important political change we have
kuown since the adoption of the constitution
of 1787. No thoughtful man cun fall to apÂ­
preciate iti beneficent effect on pur people.
It has freed us frcm perpetual danger of war
and dissolution. It has added Immensely to
the moral n.id industrial iorcc of our people.
It has liberated the master as well as the slave
from a relation which wronged aud enfeebled
both. It has â– iirreniLred to
their own guardianship the manhood
of more than five million people, and
has opened to each one of them a career of
freedom and usefulness. It has given new InÂ­
spiration to the power of selthelp in both
races, by making labor more honorable to one
and more necessary to the other. The Influence
of this force will grow greater and bear richer
fruit with coming years No doubt the great
change has caused serious disturbance to our
southern community. This is to be deplored,
though it wa.s unavoidable, but those who reÂ­
sisted the change should remember that under
our institutions there was no middle ground for
the negro race between slavery and equalization.
There could be no pcrmauent disfranchised
peasantry in the I'niUd States. Freedom can
never yield its fullness of blessings as long as
law- or its administration places the smallest
obstacle in the way of any virtuous citizen.
The emancipated race has already made reÂ­
markable progress. With unquestioned devoÂ­
tion to the Union, with a patience and gentleÂ­
ness not born of fear, they have followed the
light as God gave them to see the light. They
are rapidly laying material foundations of selfÂ­
sui>port,wldening the circle of intelligence and
beginning to enjoy blessings that gather
around homes of the industrious poor and
they deserve generous encouragement of all
good men. So far as my authority can iaw
fully extend they shall enfoythe full and equal
protection of the constitution end laws.

THE BU.LOT.

The free enjoyment of equal suffrage is still
in question, and the frank statement of the
issue may aid it-? solution. It is alleged that
in many communities negro citizens are pracÂ­
tically denied the freedom of the ballot. InÂ­
sofar as the truth of this allegation is admitÂ­
ted, it is answered that in many places honest
local government is impossible if a mass of
uneducated negroes are allowed to vote. These
are grave allegations. So far as the latter is
true, it is the only palliation that can be offerÂ­
ed for opposing the freedom of the ballot.
Bad local government is certainly a great evil
which ought to be prevented, but to vioÂ­
late the freedom and sanctity of suffrage
is more than an &vii. It is a crime which if
protested injwill destroy the government itself.
Suicide is not a remedy. If in other lands it
le high treason to compass the death of a
king, it should be counted no less a crime here
to strangle our sovereign power and stifle its
voice. It has been said that unsettled quesÂ­
tions have no pity for repose of nations. It
should be said with the utmost emphasis that
this question of suffrage will never give reÂ­
pose, or safety to States or the nation, until
each within its own jurisdiction makes and
keeps the ballot free and pure by"" the strong
sanction of law. _ ' *
But while the danger which arises from igÂ­
norance in the voter cannot be denied, it covers
field wider than that of negro suffrage and
the present condition of * that race. It is a
danger that lurks and hides tn sources and
fountains of power in every State. We have
no standard by which to measure the disaster
that may be brought upon us by ignorance
and vice iincitizens whenjolned to corruption
and fraud in suffrage?"" The voters of the
Union who make and unmake â€¢ constitutions,
and upon whose will hangs the destiny of our
government, can transmit their supreme auÂ­
thority to no successor save the coining
generation of voters who are sole heirs of the
sovereign power. If that question comes to

Daily

its inheritance blinded by ignoranco and corÂ­
rupted by vice, the fall of the republic will be
certain and without remedy. The census has
already sounded the alarm in the appalling
figures which mark how dangerously high the
tldo of illiteracy has arisen among our voters
and their children. To the South the question
is of supreme 7 Importance, but the responsiÂ­
bility for the existence of slavery did not rest
upon the South alone. The nation Itself is
responsible for the extension of suffrage
ana is .under special, obligation
to aid in removing the Illiteracy which it has
added to the voting population for North aud
South alike. But there is one remedy. All
constitutional power of the nation and of
States-, and all volunteer forces of the people
should be summoned to meet this danger, by
having the Influence of universal education.
It is a nigh privilege and sacred duty of those
now living to educate, their successors, and
fit them by intelligence and virtue for the inÂ­
heritance which awaits them. In this work
sects and races should be forgotten, and
partisanship should be unknown. Let our
people find a new meaning in the divine oracle
which declares that a little child shall lead
them, for ouv little children will soon control
the destinies of the republic.
;U.â– â– ..':â–  AN IDEAL FUTURE.

My countrymen, we do not now differ in
our judgment concerning the controversies of
past generations, and fifty years hence our
children will not be divided In their opinions
concerning our present controversies. They
will surely bless their fathers and God, that
the Union was preserved, that slavery was
overthrown, and that both races were made
equal before the law. We may hasten or we
mny retard, but we can't prevent the final reÂ­
conciliation. It is not possible for us now to
make a truce with time by anticipating and
accepting its inevitable verdict. Enterprises
of the highest importance to our moral aud
material well-being invite us and offer ample
scope for the employment of our best power?.
Let all our people, leaving behind them the
battlefields of dead issue, look forward, and
in strength and liberty and a restored Union
win grander victories of peace.
PROSPERITY OF THE COUNTRY.
The prosperity which now prevails is withÂ­
out parallel in our history. Fruitful seasons
have done much to secure it, but they have not
done all. The preservation of the public credit
and resumption of specie payment so successÂ­
fully attained by the administration of my preÂ­
decessor, has enabled our people to secure
tbe blessings which the seasons brought.
GOLD AND SILVER.
By the experience of nations in all ages, it
has been found that gold and silver afford the
only safe foundation for a monetary system.
Confu<ion has recently been created by variaÂ­
tions in the relative value of the two metals,
but I confidently believe that arrangements
can be made between leading commercial
nations which will secure the general use of
both metals. Congress should provide that
compulsory coinage of silver, now required
by law, may not be used to disturb our monÂ­
etary system by driving either
metal out <if circulation. If
possible such an adjustment
should be made that the purchasing power of
every coined dollar will be exactly equal to its
debt-paying power in all market^ of the world.
The chief duty of the national government in
connection with the currency ot the country,
is to coin and declare its value. Grave doubts
have been entertained whether Congress is auÂ­
thorized by the. constitution to make any form
of paper money a legal tender. The preset
issue of United States notes has been sustained
by the necessities of the war, lint such paper
should depend for its value and currency
upon its convenience in use and its
prompt redemption in coin at the will of the
holder, and not upon its compulsory circulaÂ­
tion. These notes are not money, but promÂ­
ises to pay money. If holders demand it the
promise should be k^it. The

lIEFINDINT. 01' THE XATIOVAI. DKBT
at a lower rate of interest should be accomÂ­
plished without compelling the withdrawal of
national bank notes and thus disturbing the
business of the country. I venture to refer to
the position T hnv<- oecupierl nn financial quesÂ­
tions during my long service in Congress, and
to ?ay that time and experience have strengthÂ­
ened the opinions I have so often
expressed on these. The Unances of the govÂ­
ernmeut shall suffer no detriment which it
may be possible for my administration to
prevent.
AQRUTLITRAL INTERESTS.
The interests of agrii-ultiuv- deserve more
attention from the government than they have
yet received. The farms of the United States
afford homes and employment for more ihnn
one-half the people, and furnish much the
largest part of our exports. *Ar the governÂ­
ment lights our coast for the protection of
mariners and Ihe benefit of commerce, so
should it give to the tillers of the-.oil the lights
of practical science and experience.

OUR MANTFACTURIEH
are rapidly making us independent; are openÂ­
ing to capital and labor new and profitable
fields of employment. This steady and
healthy growth sheuld lie still maintained.
HARBOR iND RIVER IMPROVEMENTS.
Our facilities for transportation should be
promoted by the continued Improvement of
our harbora and great interior waterways, and
by the increase of our tonnage on the ocean.
The development of the world's commerce
has led to the urgent demand for shortening
the long sea voyage around Capo Horn by
constnu-tin^

SHIP CANALS ACROSS THE ISTHMUS,
which unites the two continents. Various
plans to this end have been suggested, and
will need consideration, but none of them
have been sufficiently matured to warrant us
in extending pecuniary aid. This subject will
immediately engage the attention of the govÂ­
ernment, with a view to thorough protection
to American luterests. We will urge
no narrow policy or seek peculiar or
exclusive privileges In any commercial route,
but, in the language of my predecessors, I beÂ­
lieve it is the right and duty of the United
States to assert and maintain such supervision
and authority (over any interoceanic canal
across the isthmus that connects North and
South America as will protect our national
Interests.

RELIGION FREEDOM.

TL'1 constitution guarantee? absolute lfligiÂ­
ous freedom. Congress is prohibited from
making any law respecting the establishment
of religion or prohibiting the free exercise
thereof. The Territories of the United States
are subject to the direct legislative authority
of Congressf and hence the general governÂ­
ment, is responsible for any violation of the
constitution.in any Of them. It is therefore
a reproach to the government that in
the most populous of Territories
the constitutional quarantce is not-enjoyed by
the people, and the authority of Congress is
set at naught.
THE MORMON CHTRCH
not only offends the moral sense of mankind
polygomy, but prevents the
administration of justice through the ordinÂ­
ary instrumentalities of law. In my judgÂ­
ment it is the duty ol Congress, while reÂ­
specting to the utmost the conscientious conÂ­
victions and religious scruples of every citiÂ­
zen, to prohibit within its jurisdiction all
crimiu.il practices, especially of that class
which de3trov family relations and endanger
social order. Nor can any ecclesiastical orÂ­
ganization t>c safety permitted to usurp in the
smallest degree the functions and power-; of
thp national government.

THE CIVIL SERVICE
can never be placed on a satisfactory basis unÂ­
til it|is regulated by law for the good of the
service itself, for the protection of thO3e who
are intrusted with the appoint ing power against
waste of time and the obstruction to public
business camel by inordinate pressure for
place and for protection of incumbents against
intrigue and wrong. I shall at a proper time
ask Congress to fix the tenure of the execuÂ­
tive departments and prescribe the grounds upÂ­
on which removals shall be made during the
terms for which incumbents have been apÂ­
pointed.
Finally, acting always within the authority
and limitations of the"" aonsiitution, invading
neither the rights of States nor the reserved
rights of the jieople.
POLItT OF THE ADMINISTRATION.
It will be the purpose of my administration
to maintain authority; and in all places within
its jurisdiction to force obedience to all laws
of tha union, in ths interests of the people,
to demand rigid economy in all expenditures
of the government, and to require the honest
and faithful service of all executive officers,
remembering that officers were created, not
for the benefit of the incumbents or their supÂ­
porters, but for service of the government.
I2TTOCATIOS.
And now, fallow citizens, I am about to asÂ­
sume the great trust which you have comÂ­
mitted to my hands. I appeal to

WELL RECEIVED.

The address was delivered with uncovered
head, and voice clear, distinct aud calm, aud
was plainly heard by every one upon the stand,
and for a long distance on every hand. The
delivery of the message occupied forty-five
minutes. At its conclusion cheering^was proÂ­
longed and enthusiastic. Chief Just lc- Waite
then administered the usual oath, to which
Gen. Garfleld responded with reverential fervor.
Ex-President Hayes immediately pressed
'forward and congratulated his successor, aud
after him the President's mother and wife.both
of whom he saluted with a kiss.

A GENERAL SCENE OF CONGRATULATIONS
and hand-shaking ensued, after which the
Presidential party descended from1 the platÂ­
form by the private staircase and proceeded to
the President's room in the rear of. the Senate
chamber, where a formal reception took place.
At 1:30 the party entered their carriages and
drove to their places In the procession, which
at 1:40 started upon its return to th* White
House.
CALL OF CLASSMATES. '
Immediately after review of the procession
President Garfleld received the Williams colÂ­
lege association of Washington with the
visiting alumni, to the number of fifty, in
the east room of the executive mansion. Ex-
President Mark Hopkins eloquently presented
the congratulations of the alumni. President
Garfleldmade an appropriate reply, in which
he exhibited considerable emotion. AfterÂ­
wards . the alumni were presented to the
mother and wife of President Garfleld and
Mrs. Rockwell. Twenty members of PresiÂ­
dent Garfield's class were among the alumni
present.
EVENING FESTIVITIES.
The city is brilliantly Illuminated to-night
and the streets are filled* with people. At >, 8
o'clock a handsome display of fireworks took
place immediately south of the treasury depart-

ment, and attracted an enormous crowd, the
streets for squares being utterly impassible.
Many public receptions and entertainments toÂ­
night. Senators Sherman and Pendleton enÂ­
tertained the general asscmby and State offiÂ­
cers of Ohio and other noted guests.
The Massachusetts State arch was blown
down and Lewis Weston, a member of the
Pottsville band, fatally injured.
INAUGURATION BALL.
Washington, March 4.--The inauguration
ball to-day svas a perfect success. At 9 o'clocki
the hour at which the President was expected,

ple, had entered the large nnd handsomely decÂ­
orated building. *
At9:3o the combined orchestra of one hunÂ­
dred pieces announced the entrauce of PresiÂ­

nessed the brilliant scene beneath for twenty
minutes or more. Shortly after President
Garfleld with his wife nnd mother retired and

a of the teeth. Up to a certain age, one who has
a studiedetbe structure of the month carefully may
. be able to tell quite accurately, and this is done by
: observing the following rules laid down by the
b
Dsblin Farmer's Gazette:
t ""The foal is born with twelve grinders. When
if four front teeth have made their appearance, the
a colt is twelve days old,'and when the next four
' assert themselves, its age will be about twenty-eight
it days. The corner teeth make their appearance
y when the foal is eight months old, and these latter
3. attain the height of the front teeth at the age of a
v year. The two.year-old has the kernel, the dark
e
substance in the middle of the tooth's crown, gronud
k out of all the front teeth. In the third year the
F middle front of teeth are shifted, and when three
. years old these are substituted by the permanent
b(or horse) teeth, which are larger and more yellow
E than their predecessors. The next four teeth are
a shifted in the fourth year, and the corner teeth in
i the fifth, giving place to the permanent nipper.
V ""At five years of age a horse has forty tsetb. of
5
which twenty-four are grinders, far back in the jaw,
with which we have little to do. But, be it remem.
I bered, horses invariably have tusks, whibh mares
t
very rarely do. Before the ag of six is arrived at,
, the tusk is full grown, and has a slight groove on
F
its internal surface (wbieh--generally disappears
with age, the toeIl itself becoming more rounded
and blunt) and at six the kernel or mark is worn
. out of the middle front teeth. There will still be
Iva difference of color in the centre of the tooth.
"" The tusks have now attained their full growth,
I
being nearly or quite an inch in length, convex
I wiihout, concave within, tending to a point and
the extremity somewhat curved. Now, er perhaps
I some months before, the horse may be said to have
Ia perfect mouth.
I""At seven years the mark, as described, is very
lnearly worn out of the four centre nippers, and
f fast wearing away in the corner teeth, especially in
I mares; but the black still remains in the centre of
the tooth, and is not completely filled up until the
animal is eight years old. As he gets on past seven,
lthe bridle teeth begin to wear away.
, ""At eight the kernel has entirely disappeared
fromalltheolowernippers,and begins to decrease
l in the middle nippers. It is now said to be 'past
tmark of the mouth.' There are indications, howÂ­
,ever, after this age which will enable a very shrewd
.observer to guess very closely at a horse's age, but
l none that can be relied upon by observers. As

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE,
FELLOW CLTIZENS OF THE SENATE ""AND HOUS OF
REPRESENTATIVES:-.





In.the midst of unprecedented political troubles
we have cause of great gratitude to God for unÂ­
usual good health and most abundant harvests.
You will not be surprised .to learn that, in the
peculiar exigencies of the times, our intercourse
with foreign nations has beenÂ­ attended withlproÂ­
found solicitude, chiefly turiing upon our own doÂ­
mestic affairs. A disloyal portion of the American
people have, during the whole year, been engaged
in an attempt to divide and destroy the Union. A
.nition which endures factious domestic divisions is
exposed to disrespect abroad, and one party, if not
both, is sure, sooner or later, to invoke foreign inÂ­
tervention. Nations thus tempted to iiterfere are
not always able to resist the oounsels of seeming
expediency and ungenerous ambition, although
measures adopted under such influences seldom
fail to hbe unfortunate and injurious to those
adopting them.
THE ""REBEL INVOCATION OF FOREIGN AID.
The disloyal citizens of the United States,'who
have offered the rain of our country in return for
the aid. and comfort which they have invoked
abroad, have receit-ed less patronage and en-.
couragement than they probably expected. If. it
were just to suppose, as the insurgents have
seemed to assume, that foreign nations, in this.
case, discarding all moral, social and treaty obliÂ­
gations, would act solely and selfishly for
the most speedy restoration of commerce,: inÂ­
cluding especially the acquisition of cotÂ­
ton, those nations appear as yet not to
have seen their way to their object more, directly
or clearly through the destruction thanutroughthe
preservation of the'Union. If we could dare to
believe that foreign nations are actuated by no
higher principle than this, I am quite sure a second.
argument couldbe made to show them that they
can reach their aim more readily and easily by
aiding to crush this rebellion than by giving enÂ­
couragement to it.
THE Qu STION OF INTERNATIONAL COMDIREE.
The principal lever relied on by the insurÂ­
gents for exciting foreign nations to hostility
against us, as already intimated, is the embarrassÂ­
ment of commerce. Those nations, however, not
improbably saw from the last that it was the
Union which made as well our foreign as our doÂ­
mestic commerce. They can scarcely have failed
to perceive that the effort for disunion produces
the existing difficulty, and that one strong nation
promises more durable peace, and a more extenÂ­
sive, valuable and reliable commerce than can the
same nation broken into hostile fragments.
COAST AND GENERAL PUBLIC DEFENCES.
It is not my purpose to review our disÂ­
cussions with foreign States, because, whatÂ­
ever might be their wishes or dispositions, the
integrity of.our country and the stability of our
government mainly dep.ends not upon them, but
on the loyalty, virtue, patriotism and intelligence
of the American people. The correspondence
itself, with the usual reservations, is herewith subÂ­
mitted. I venture to hope it will appear that we
have practised prudence and liberality towards
foreign Powers, averting causes of irritation,
and, with firmness, maintaining our own
rights and honor. Since, however, it is
apparent that here, as. in every other State,
foreign dangers necessarily attend domestic
difficulties, I recommend that adequate and ample
measures be adopted for maintaining the public
defences on every side, while, under this general
recommendation, provision for defending our coast
line readily occurs to the mind. I also,
in the same connection, ask the attenÂ­
tion of Congress to our great lakes and
rivers. It is believed that some fortifications
and depots of arms and munitions, with harbor and
navigation improvements at well selected points
upon these, would be. of great importance to the
national defence and preservation.
I ask attention to the views of theSecretary of
War, expressed inhisreport upon the same general
subjects.


MILITARY RAILROAD BETWEEN THE LOYAL PARTS OF
TENNESSEE, NORTH CAROLINA, KENTUCKY, ETC.
I deem it of importance that the loyal regions of
East Tennessee and Western North Carolina should
be connected with Kentucky and other faithful
parts oi the Union by railroad. I therefore reÂ­
commend, as a military measure, that Congress
provide for the construction of such road as speedÂ­
ily as possible. Kentucky will no doubt coÂ­
operate, and through her Legislature make the
most judicious selection of a line. The northern
terminus must connect with some existing
railroad; and whether the route shall be frdm
Lexington or Nashville to the Cumberland'Gap,
or from Lebanon to the Tdnnessee line, in the
direction of Knoxville, or on some still differ.
ent line, can easily be determined. Kentucky and
the general government co-operating, the work
can be completed in a very short time; and when
done, it will not only be of vast presentnsefulness,
but also a valuable permanent improvement, worth
its cost in all the future.
NEW FOREIGN TREATIES.
Some treaties, designed chiefly for the interests
of commerce, and having no great political imporÂ­
tance, have been negotiated, andwill be submitted
to the Senate for their consideration. Although
we have failed to induce some of the commercial
Powers` to adopt a desirable melioration of the
rigor of maritime war, we have removed all obÂ­
structions from the way of this humane reform, exÂ­
cept such as arednerely of temporary and accidentÂ­
al occurrence.
THE DETENTION OF THE EILTIJSU SHIP PERTHSHIRE.
I invite your attention to the correspondence beÂ­
tween her Britannic Majesty's Minister, accredited
to this government, and the Secretary of State,
relative to the detentien of the British ship Perth.
shire, in June lat, by the United States steamer




 Massachusetts, for a supposed breach of the blockÂ­
ade. As this detention was occasioned by an obÂ­
vious misapprehension of the facts, and as justice
requires that we should commit no belligerent act
not founded in strict right, as sanctioned by public
law, I recommend that an appropriation be made
to satisfy the reasonable demand of the owners of'
the vessel for her detention.
SURPLUS OF CLAfIS AGAINST CHINA.
I repeat the recommendation of my predecessor,
in Iis annual Message to Congress in December
last, in regard to the dispositi' of the surplus
which will probably remain aft' sati.fyjing the
claims of American citizens against , purn
ant to the awards of the Commissioners iunder the
act of the 3d of March, 1859. If, however, it
should pnot be deemed advisable to carry that
recommendation into effect, I Would suggest
that authority be given for investing the prinÂ­
cipal over the proceeds of the surplus referred
to iii good securities, with a view to the satisfacÂ­
tion of such other just claim of our citizens against
China as are not unlikely to arise hereafter in the
c6urse df'oiir exteisive trade with that empire.
'ROTECTION OF COMMERCE ON THE SEAS FROM
IRBATES.
By the act of the 5th of August last Congress
authorized the President to instruct the commandÂ­
ers of suitable vessels toidefend themselves against
and'to capture pirates. This authority has been
exercised in a single instance only.
For the more effectual protection of our
extensive and valuable commerce, in the
Eastern seas especially, !it seems to me 'that
it would also be advisablei to authorize
the commanders of sailing vessels to recapture any
prizes which pirates may make'of the United States
vessels and their cargoes, and the Consul'ar Courts,
established by law in Eastern countries, to adjudiÂ­
cate the cases, in the event that this should not be
objected to by the local authorities.
RECOONITION OF THE. SOLEREIGNTY OF HAY'I AND
LIBERIA.
If any good reason exists why we should perÂ­
severe longer in withholding our recognition
of the independence and sovereignty, of Hayti'
and Liberia, I am unable to' discern it..UnÂ­
willing, however, to inaugurate
. a novel
policy in regard to them without the approbation
of Congress, I submit for your consideration the
expediency of an appropriation for maintaining a
Charge d'Affaires near each of those new States.
It does not admit of doubt that important commer
cial advantages might be secured by favorable
treaties with them.
THE TAKING UP OF THE NATIONAL LOAN.
The operations of the Treasury during
the period which has elapsed since your
adjournment have been conducted with sig
nal success. The patriotism of the people hasÂ­
placed at the disposal of the government the large
means demanded by the public exigencies. Much
of the national loan. has been taken by citizens
of the industrial classes, whose confidence in their
country's faith, and zeal for their country's deliÂ­
verance from its present peril, have induced them
to contribute to the support of the government
the whole of their limited acquisitions. This
fact imposes . peculiar' obligations to econoÂ­
my in 'disbursement' and energy . in action.
THE REVENUE BECEIPTS TO JUNE LAST. a
The revenue from all sources, including loans,.
for the financial year ending on the 30th of June,
1861, was eighty-six millions eight hundred and
thirty-live thousand nine hundred dollars and
twenty-seven cents, and the expenditures
for the same period, including payments on'
account of the public debt, were eighty-four milÂ­
lions five hundred and seventy-eight thousand and
thirty-four dollars and forty-seven cents, leaving a
balance in the treasury on the 1st of July of. two
millions two hundred and fifty-seven thousand and
sixty-five dollars and eighty cents. For the first
'quarter of the financial year ending on the 30th of
September, 1861, the receipts from all sources,
including the balance. of Jdly 1, were
one hundred and two millions five -ifinndred and
thirty-two thousand five liunilred and nine dollars
and twenty-seven cents, and the expenses ninetyÂ­
eight millions two hundred and thirty-nine thouÂ­
sand seven hundred and thirty-three dollars and
nine cents--leaving a balance on the 1st of OctoÂ­
ber, 1861, of four mnillions two hundred and ninetyÂ­
two thousand seven hundred and seventy-six dolÂ­
lars and eighteen cents.


THE ESTIMATES FOR THE FORTHCOMING YEAR, ETC.
Estimates for the remaining three quarters of the
year and for the financial year of 1863, together
with his views of the ways and means for meetÂ­
ing the demands contemplated by them, will be
submitted to Congress by the Secretary of tlie
Treasury. It is gratifying to know that the exÂ­
penses made necessary by the rebellion are not
beyondÂ­ the resources of the loyal people, and to
believe that the same patriotism which has thus
far sustained the government will continue to susÂ­
tain it till peace and union shall again bless the
land.
THE STRENGTH OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY.
I respectfully refer to the report of the Secretary
of War for information respecting the numerical
strength of the army, and for recomnmendations hasÂ­
ing in view an increase of its efficiency and the well
being of the various branches of the service enÂ­
trusted to his care. It is gratifying to know that
the patriotism of the people has proved equal to the
occasion, and that the number of troops tendered
greatly exceeds the force which Congress authorÂ­
ized me to call into the field. I refer with pleasure
to those portions of his report which make alluÂ­
sion to the creditable degree of discipline already
attained by our troops, and to the excellent saniÂ­
tary condition of the entire army. The recomÂ­
mendation of the Secretary for an organization of
the militia upon a uniform basis is a subject of
vital importance to the future safety of the
country, and is commended to the serious attenÂ­
tion of. Congress. The large addition to the
regular army, in connection with the defection
that has so considerably diminished the number of
its officers, gives peculiar importance to his recomÂ­
mendation for increasing the corps ofÂ­ cadets to
the greatest capacity of the Military Academy.
MILITARY CHAPLAINS FOR HOSPITALS RECOIMMENDED.
- By mere omission, I presume, Congress
has failed to provide chaplainf for the
hospitals occupied by the volunteers. This
subject was brought to my notice, and I was
induced to draw up the form of a letter, one copy
of which, properly addressed, has b'een delivered
to each of the persons,and at the dates respecÂ­
tively named, and stated in a schedule containing
also the form of the letter, marked A, and herewith
transmitted. These gentlemen, I understand, enÂ­
tered upon the duties designated at the times reÂ­
spectively stated in the schedule, and have labored
faithfully therein ever. since. I therefore recomÂ­
mend that they be compensated at the same rate
as chaplains in the army. I further suggest that
general provision be made for chaplains to serve at
hospitals as well as with regiments.
-EFFICIENCY OP THE UNITED STATES NAVY.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy preÂ­
sents in detail the operations of that branch of the
service, the activity and energy which have chaÂ­
racterized its administration, and the results of
measures to increase its. efficiency and power.
Such have beenthe additions by constru'ction and
purchase, that it may almost be said a navy has
been created and brought into service sined our
difficulties commenced. Besides blbckadin, our
extensive coast, squadrons larger than ever before
assembled under our flag have been put afloat,
and performed deeds which have increased our
naval renown.
A MORE PERFECT ORGANIZATION OF THE NAVY REB
COMMENDED.
I would invite special attention to the recomÂ­
mendation of the Secretary for a more perfect orÂ­
ganization of the navy, by introducing additional
grades ia the service. The resenat organization

 is.defective and unsatisfactory, and the suggesÂ­
tions submitted by the department will, it is beÂ­
lieved, if adopted, obviate the difficulties alludedto
and promote -harmony and increase the efficiency
of the iavy.
THE VACANCIES ON THE BENCH OF'TEE SUPREME
COURT.
There are three-vacaucies on the bench of the
Supreme Court-tw oby the decease of Justices
Daniel and McLean, and one by the resignation of
Justice Campbell. I have so far forborne making
nominations to fill the vacancies for reasons which
fiwillnow siite. Two of the outgoing judges re.
sided witlhin'the States-now overrun by revolt. So
that if successors were appointed in the same loÂ­
calities, they could not now serve upon their cirÂ­
cuits, and many of the most competent men there
probably would not take the personal hazard of
accepting to serve even here upon the Supreme
bench. I have been unwilling to throw all the apÂ­
pointments northward, titus disabling myself from
doing justice to the South *on the return of
peace, although I may . remark, that to
transfer to the North one which has heretofore
been in the South would not, with reference to
territory and population, be unjust.
THE WESTERN CIRCUIT TOO LARGE.
During the long and brilliant judicial career of
Judge McLean his circuit grew into an empire alÂ­
together too large for any one judge to give the
courts therein more than a nominal attendanceÂ­
rising in population from one million four hundred
and seventy thousand and eighteen in 1830, to six
millions one hundred and fifty-one thousand four
ihundred and five in 1860. Besides this the counÂ­
try generally leas outgrown our present judicial
system. If uniformity was at all intended the sysÂ­
tem requires that all the States shall be accommoÂ­
dated with Circuit Courts, attended by SuÂ­
preme Judges; while, in fact, Wisconsin, MinÂ­
nesota., Iowa, Kansas, Florida, Texas, CaliforÂ­
nia an~ Oregon have never had any such courts.
Nor can. this well be remedied without a change
of the system, because the adding of judges to the
Supreme Court,'' enough for the accommodation
of all parts of the country with Circuit Courts,.
would create a court altogether too numerous for
a judicial body of any sort, and the evil of it be
one that will increase as new States come into the
Union. Circuit Courts are useful or they are not useÂ­
ful. If useful, no State should be denied them; if not
useful, no State should have them. Let them be
provided for all or abolished as to all.
MODIFICATIONS OF THE SUPREME COURT.
Three modifications occur to me, either of which
I think would be an improvement upon our preÂ­
sent system. Let the Supreme Court be of conÂ­
venient number in every event.
Then, first, let .the whole country be diÂ­
vided into circuits of convenient size-the
Supreme Judges to serve in a number of them, corÂ­
responding to their own number, and independent
Circuit Judges be provided for all the rest.
Or, secondly, let the Supreme Judges be re:
lieved from circuit duties and Circuit Judges proÂ­
vided for all the circuits.
Or, thirdly, .dispense with Circuit Courts altoÂ­
gether, leaving the judicial functions wholly to the
District Courts and an independent Supreme Court.
REMEDY FOR THE PRESENT INCONVENIENClES OF THE
STATUTE LAWS.
I respectfully recommend to the considerationi of
Congress the present condition of the statute laws,
with the hope-that Congress will be able to find
an easy remedy for many of the inconveniences
and evils which constantly embarrass those enÂ­
gaged .in the practical administration of them.
Since the organization of: the government ConÂ­
gress has enacted some five thousand acts and
joint resolutions, whilch fill imore than six thousand
closely printed pages, and are scattered. through
many, volumes. Many of these acts have been
drawn in hbaste and without sufficient caution, so
that their provisions are often obscure in themÂ­
selves or in. conflict with each other, or at least so
doubtful as to render it very difficult for even the
best informed persons to ascertain precisely what
the statute law realy is. It seems to me very imporÂ­
taut that thestatute laws should be made as plain
and intelligent as possible; and be reduced to as
small a compass as may: consist with the fiulÂ­
ness and precisio . of .the will of the legislaÂ­
ture and the perspicuity of its language; these,
well done, would, I think, greatly facilitate the
labors of those whose duty it is to assist inr the'
administration of the laws, and would be a
lasting benefit to 'the people, by placing before
thcm in a more accessible and intelligible form
the laws which so deeply affect their interests and
their duties.


THE ACTS OF CONGRESS TO BE CONDENSED INTO ONE
OOR TWO VOLUMES.
I ar informed by some, whose opinions I reÂ­
spect, that all the cots of Congress, now in force
and of a 'permanent and general nature, might
be revised and rewritten so as to be embraced
in one volume, or at least two volumes of ordinary
and convenient size, and I respectfully recommend
to Congress to consider the subject, and-if my
suggestion be approved, to devise some plan as to
their wisdom shall seem most proper for the attainÂ­
ment of the end proposed.
CIVIL JUSTICE SUPPIIESSED BY THE REBELLION,
One of the unavoidable consequences of the preÂ­
sent insurrection is the entire stippression in many
places of all ordinary means of administering civil
justice by the officers and in the forms of existing
law., This is the case in whole or in part in all
the insurgent States; and as our armies advance
upon and take possession of parts of these States
the practical evil becomes more apparent. There
are no courts, nor officers to whom the citizens of
other States may apply for the enforcement -of
their lawful claims against citizens of the insurÂ­
gent States,. and there is a vast amount of
debt constituting such claims. Some have estiÂ­
mated it as high as two hundred millions
of dollars, due in' large part from insurÂ­
gents, in open rebellion, to loyal citizens who
are even now .making great sacrifices in the
discharge of their patriotic duty to support the goÂ­
vernment.
-
ILITIARY COURTS TO BE TEMPORARILY ESTABLISHED.
Under these circumstances I have been urÂ­
gently solicite'd to establish, by military. power,
courts to administer summary justice'insuch cases.
I hard thus far declined to do it, not because I had
any doubt that the end proposed--the collection
of the debts-was just and right in itself, but beÂ­
causeI have been unwilling to go beyond the presÂ­
sure of necessity in the unusual exercise of power.
But the powers of Congress, I suppose, are equal to
the anomilous occasion, and therefore I refer the
whole matter to Congress, with the hope that a
plan may be devised for the administration ofjusÂ­
tices in all stucli parts of the insurgent States and
Territories as may be under control of this governÂ­
ment, whether by a-voluntary return to allegiance
and order or by the power pf our arms; this, howÂ­
ever, not to be a permanent institution, but a' temÂ­
porary substitute, and to cease as soon as the orÂ­
dinary courts can be re-established in peace.
SETILEMENT OF CLAIMS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT
It is important that some more convenientmeans
should be provided, if possible, for the adjustÂ­
ment of claims against the government, especially
in view. of their increased number by' reason of the
war. It is as much the duty of government to renÂ­
der prompt justice against itself, in favor of citiÂ­
zens, as it is to administer the same between privÂ­
ate individuals. The investigation and adjudication.
of claims, intheir nature, belong to the judicial deÂ­
partment; besides it is apparent that the attention
of Congress will be more than usually engaged, for
some time to come, with great national questions.
It was intended by the organization of the Court
of Claims mainly to remove this branchof busiÂ­
ness from the halls of Congress; but while the
court has proved to be an effectivo and valuable
means of investigation, it, in a great degree;
fails to effect the obiect of its creation, for

 want of power to make its judgments final.
Fully aware of the delicacy, not to say the danÂ­
ger, of the subject, I commend to your cgeful
consideration whether this power of making judgÂ­
ments final may not properly be given to the court,
reserving the right of appeal on questions of law.
to the Supreme Court, with such other provisions
as experience may have shownuto be necessary.
POSTAL REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE.
I ask attention to the report of the Postmaster
General, the following being a summary statement
of the condition of the department:Â­
The revenue from all sources during the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1861, ihcluding the annual
permanent appropriation of seven hundred thouÂ­
sand dollars for the transportation of free mail
matter, was nineÂ­ million forty-nine thousand two
hundred and ninety-six dollars and forty cents,
being about two per cent less than the revenue
for 1860. The expenditures were thirteen millions
six hundred and six thousand seven hundred and
fifty-nine dollars and eleven cents, showing a deÂ­
crease of more than eight per cent, as compared
withthose of the previous year, and leaving an exÂ­
cess of expenditures over the revenue for the last
fiscal year of over five, hundred and fifty-seven
thousand four hundred and sixty-two dollars and
seventy-one cents. The gross revenue for the year
ending June 30, 1802, is estimated at.an increase
of four per cent on that of 1861l making
eight millions. six hundred and eighty-three
thousand dollars, to which should be added
the earnings of the department; in carrying free
matter, viz:--Seven hundred thousand dollars, makÂ­
ing nine millions three hundred and eighty-three
thousand dollars. The total expenditures for 1862
are estimated at twelve millions five hundred and
twenty-eight thousand dollars,leaving an estimateid
deficiency of three million one hundred and fortyÂ­
five thousand dollars to be supplied .from the
Treasury, in addition to the permanent appropriaÂ­
tion.
VTIGINIA PORTION OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
The present insurrection shows, I think, that the
extension of this District across the Potomac river,
at the time of establishing the capital here, was
eminently wise, and consequently that the relinÂ­
quishment of that portion .of it which lies within
the State of Virginia was unwise and dangerous. I
submit for your consideration the expediency of
regaining that part of the District and the restoraÂ­
tion of the original boundaries thereof, through
negotiations with the State of Virginia.
DEFART3IENT OF THE INTERJOR.
The report of the Secretary of the Interior, with
the accompanying documents, exhibit the condiÂ­
tion of the several branches of the public business
pertaining to that department. The depressing
influences of the insurrection have been especially
felt in the operations of the Patent and General
Land Offices. The cash receipts from the sales of
public lands during the past year have exceeded
the expenses of our land system only about two
hundred thousand dollars. The sales have been
entirely suspended in the Southern States, while
the interruptions to the business of the country
and the diversion of large numbers of men from
labor to.military service have obstructed settleÂ­
ments in the new States and Territories of the
Northwest.
PATENT OFFICE RnEOEPTS DECLINED.
The receipts of the Patent Office have declined
in nine months about one hundred thousand dolÂ­
lars, rendering a large reduction of the-force emÂ­
ployed necessary to make it self-sustaining.
PENSION OFFICE DEMIANDS INCREASINC-ImBELS TO BE
STRUCK OFF THE LIST.
The demands upon the Pension Office will be
largelyihncreased by the insurrection. Numerous
applications for pensions, based upon the casualÂ­
ties of the existing war, have already been made.
There is reason to believe that many who are now
upon the pension roll, and in receipt of the fiounty
of the government, are in the ranks of the insiur
gent army, or giving them aid
- and comfort. The
Secretary of the Interior has directed a suspenÂ­
sion of the payment of the pensions of such perÂ­
sions, upon proof of their disloyalty. I recommend
that Congress authorize that officer to cause the
names of such persons to be stricken from the
pension roll. l


SINDIAN TROUBLES CAUSED BY THE REBELLION.
The relations of the government with the Indian
tribes have been greatly disturbed by the insurÂ­
rection, especially in the - Southern SuperintenÂ­
dency and in that of New Mexico. The InÂ­
dian country south of Kansas is in possession
of the insurgents from Texas and Arkansas. The
agents of the United States, appointed since the
4th of March for this superintendency,' have been
unable to reach their posts, while the most of
those who were in office before that time have esÂ­
poused the insurrectionary cause, and assume to
exercise the powers of agents by virtue of the
commission from the insurrectionists. It has been
stated in the public press that a portion of these
Indians have been organized as a military force,
and are attached to the army of the insurgents.
Although the government has no official informaÂ­
tion upon the subject, letters have been written to
the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, by several
prominent chiefs, giving assurance of their loyalty
to the United States, and expressing a wish for the
presence of the federal troopsto protect them. It is
believed that upon the repossession of the country
by the federal forces the Indians will readily cease
allhostile demonstrations and resume their former
relations to the. government.
BCREAU OF AGRICULTURE RECOMMENDED.
Agricidture, confessedly the largest interestÂ­
of the nation, has not a department nor a buÂ­
reau, but a clerkship only assigned to it in
the government. While it is fortunate that
this great interest is so independent in itsnature as
not to have demanded and extorted more from the
government, I respectfully ask Congress to conÂ­
sider whether something more cannot be given
voluntarily with general advantage. Annual
reports exhibiting the condition of our agricol-.
ture, commerce and manufactures, would preÂ­
sent a fund of information of great practical value
to the country. While I make no suggestion as to
details, I venture the opinion that an agricultural
and statistical bureau might profitably be organized.
SLAVE TRADE REPORT.
The execution of the laws for the suppression of
the African slave trade has been coniidedto the
Department of the Interior. It is a subject of conÂ­
gratulation that the efforts which have been made
for the suppression of this inhuman traffic
haveÂ­ been recently attended with 'unusual sucÂ­
cess. Five vessels being fitted out for the slave
trade have been seized and condemned. Two
mates engaged in the trade, and one perÂ­
son in
. equipping a vessel as a slaver,
have been convicted ad subjected to the
penalty of a fine and imprisonment, and one captain,
taken with a cargo of Africans on board his vesÂ­
sel, has been convicted of the highest grade of
offence under our laws, the punishment of which
is death.
THE NEW TERRITORIES IN THE WEST.
The Territories ofColorado, Dacotah and Nevada,
created by the last Congress, have beea organized,
and civil Elministration has be~n inaugurated
therein under auspices especially gratifying, when
it is considered that the leaven of treason was
found existing in some of these new countries when
the federal officers arrived there. The abundant
natural resources of these Territories, with the seÂ­
curity and protection afforded by organized govÂ­
ment, will doubtless invite to them a large immiÂ­
gration when peace shall restore the business of
the country to its accustomed channels. I submit
the 'resolutions of the Legislature of Colorado,
which evidence the patriotic spirit of the people
of the Territory. So far the authority of the United
States has been upheld in all the Territories, as it
is hopedit willbe in the future. I commend their iaÂ­
terests and defence to the -enlightened aud gene.
rous care of Congress.

 INTEoRESTS N TH DISTRIOT.P COLUMBIA TO BE CONÂ­
SIDERED.
I recommend to the favorable - consideraÂ­
tion of Congress, the interests of the District
of Columbia. The insurrection has been
the cause of much suffering
and sacrifice
to its inhabitants; and as they have no representaÂ­
tire in Congress that body should not overlook
their just claims, upon the government.
-IiE exHIBITION OF INDUSTry O 1862.
At your late session a joint resolution was adopt.
ed authorizing the President to take measures for
facilitating a proper representative of the industrial
interests of the United States at the Exhibition
of the Industry of Hit Nations, to be
holden at London in the year 1862.
I regret to say I have been unable to give perÂ­
sonal attention to this subject-a subject at once
so interesting in itself and so extensively and inÂ­
tricately connected with the material prosperity
of the world. Through the Secretaries of State
and of the Interior a plan or system has been deÂ­
vised and partly matured which will be laid before
you.
COLONIZATION OF EMANCIPATED SLAVES.
Under and by virtue of the act of Codtress, enÂ­
titled ""An Act to Confiscate Property used for
Insurrectionary Purposes,"" approved August 6,
1861, the legal claims of certain persons to the
labor and service of certain other persons hate
become forfeited, and niusbers of the
latter thus liberated are already depend.
cut on the United States and must be
provided for in some way. Besides this, it is not
impossible that some of the States will pass simi,
lar enactments for their own benefits respectively,
and bythe operation of which persons of the same
class will be thrown upon them for disposal. In
such case I recommend that Congress provide for
accepting suchlpersons from such States, according
to some modebof valuation, inlklet)piotanto of direct
taxes, or upon some other plan to be agreed on
with such States respectively that such persons, on
such acceptance by the general government, be at
once deemed free; and that in any event steps be
taken for colonizing both classes, or the one first
mentioned, if the other shall not be brought into
existence, at some place or places in a climate conÂ­
genial to them. It might be well to consider, too,
whether the free colored people already in the UniÂ­
ted States could not, so far as individuals may deÂ­
sire,b.e included in such colonization. To carry out
the plan of colonization may involve the acquiring
of territory, and also the appropriation of money
beyond that to be expended in the territorial aequiÂ­
sition. Having practised the acquisition of territoÂ­
ry for nearly sixty years the question of constitutionÂ­
al power to do so is no longer an open one with us.
The power was at first questioned by Mr. JefferÂ­
son, who, however, in the purchase of Louisiana,
yielded his scruples on the plea of great expeÂ­
diency. If it be said thatthc only legitimate object
of acquiring territory is to furnish homes for white
men this measure effects that object, for the emiÂ­
gration of colored men leaves additional room for
white men remaining or coming here. Mr.
Jefferson, however, placed the importance of
procuring Louisiana more on political and comÂ­
mercial grounds than on providing room for popuÂ­
lation.


THE INTEGRITY OF THE UIION THE 'RIMlARY OBJECT
OF THE WAR.
On: this whole proposition, including the approÂ­
priation of money with the acquisition of territory,
does not the expediency amount to absolute necesaÂ­
sity,: without which the goverrment cannot be
perpetuated? The war continues. In considering
the policy to be adopted for suppressing the inÂ­
surrection I have been anxious and careful that
the inevitable conflict for this purpose shall not
degenerate into a violent and remorseless revoluÂ­
tionary struggle. I have, therefore, in every case,
thought it proper to keep the integrity of the Union
prominent as the primary object of the contest on
our part, leaving all questions which are not:of
vital military importance to the more deliberate
action of the legislature. In the exercise of my
best discretion I have adhered to the blockade of
the ports held by the insurgents, instead of putting
in force, by proclamation, the law of Congress'enÂ­
acted at the last session for closing those ports.
So, also, obeying the dictates of prudence, as
well as the obligations of law, instead of tranÂ­
scending I have adhered to the act of
Congress to confiscate property, and for insurrecÂ­
tionary purposes. If a new law upon the same
subject shall be proposed, its propriety will be
duly considered. The UTnion must be preserved,
and hence all dispensable meansmust be employed.
We should not be in haste to determine that radiÂ­
cal and extreme measures, whiah may reach the
loyal as well as the disloyal, are indispensable.
The inaugural address at the beginning of the
Administration, and the Message to Congress at
the late special session, were both mainly devoted
to the domestic controversy out of which the inÂ­
surrection and consequent war have sprung. No.
thing now occurs to add to, or subtract frowr, the
principles or generalpurposes stated and expressÂ­
ed in those documents. The last ray of
hope for preserving the Union peaceably
expired at the assault upon Fort Sumter, and a
general review of what has occurred since may
not be unprofitable. What was painfully uncertain
then is much better defined and more distinct now,
and thie progress of events is plainly in the right
direct on.


TES :: %' . STATES OF MARYLAND, KENTUCKY AND
M):-"",N ..1 UNCEANGEABLY RANGED ON THE SIDE OP
Tli;, UNION.
The insurgents confidently claimed a strong
support from -north of Mason and Dixon's line,
and the friends of the Union were not free
from apprehension on the point. This, however,
was soon settled definitelyand on the right side.
South of the line noblle little Delaware led
off right from the first.
- Maryland was made
to seem against the Union our soldiers were asÂ­
saulted, bridges were burned and railroads torn up
within her limits, and we were many days at one
time without the ability to bring a single regiment
over her soil to the capital. Now her bridges
and railroads are repaired and open to the governÂ­
ment. She already gives seven regiments to the
cause of the Union and none to the enemy, and her
people, at a regular election, have sustained the
Union by a large majority, and a larger aggregate
vote thalfthey ever before gave to any candidate
or any question.
Kentucky, too, for some time in doubt, is now
decidedly and, I think, unchangeably ranged on
the side of the Union.
Missouri is comparatively quiet, and I believe
cannot again be overrun' by the insurrectionists:
These three States of Maryland, Kentucky and
Missouri, neither of which would promise a single
soldier at first, have now an aggregate of not less
than 40,000 in the field for the Union; while
of their citizens, certainly not more than
a third number, and they of doubtful
whereabouts and doubtful exissenee, are
in arms against it, After a somewhat
bloody struggle of months, winter closes.ou the
Union people of Western Virginia, leaving them
masters of their own country.
-
EASTERN VIRGINIA RETURNS TO HIR ALLEGIANCE.
An insurgent force of about fifteen hundred, for
months dominating the narrow peninsular region
constituting t
l counties of Aecomae and NorthÂ­
ampton, and known as the Eastern Shore of Vih
ginia, together with some contiguous parts of
Maryland, have laid down their arms, and the peoÂ­
ple there have renewed their allegiance to and
accepted the protection of the old 'flag. This
leaves no armed insurrection aorth of the Potomac
Sor erit of the Chesapeake.
OCtFPATION OF HATTERAS, PORT ROYAL. AND TYEE
ISLAND.
Also we have obtail a footing at each of the
i isolated points on the Southern coast of Hatteras,
Port Royal, Tybee Island, rear Savannah, and
Ship Island, and we likewise have some ceneraL





accounta of 'poputar movemeiits in behalf of the'
Union in North Carolina and Tennessee. These
things demonstrate that the course of the Union is
advancing steadily southward.
RETIREMENT OF GENERAL SC00TT.
since your last adjournment Lieutenant General
boott has retired froth the head of the army. DurÂ­
ing his long life the nation has not been unÂ­
mindful of his merit, yet on calling to mind
how faithfully, ably and brilliantly he has
served the country from a time far, back
n our 'history, when few of the now living had
been born and thenceforward continually, I. canÂ­
not but think that we are still his debtor. I subÂ­
mit, therefore, for your consideration what furtheri
mark of recognition is due to him and ourselves as
a grateful people.
bPPOINTMENT OF GENERAL 15'CLELLAN As CO~~AN-r
ER-IN-CIIIEFI
With the retirement of General Scott: came the
eoihutlve duty of appointing in -his: stead a
general-in-chief of the ""army. It. is -a fortuÂ­
nate circumstance that nieither in council nor counÂ­
try was there, so far as I know, any differefiee of
opinion as to the proper person to 'be selected.
The retiring chief repeatedly expressed his
judgment in favor of General McClellai for the poÂ­
Ssition, and in this the nation seemed ,to give a
Snanimous concurrence. The designation 'of Gene-,
ial McClellan is therefore in a considerable degree'
the selection of the country as well as 'of. the ExÂ­
ecetive, aid hence there is better reason-to;hope;
there will be given him the confidence and cordial
support thus byfair implication 'promised,'nd'
without which he, cannot with 'so full efficiehcy
serve the country. Ithas been said that one bad
general is better than two'good ones, and the saying
is true, if taken to mean no, more than an army
is better directed by a.singie, mind, though lifeÂ­
rior, than by two superior ones' at variance andÂ­
cross purposes.' And the same is true in all joint
operations wherein those engaged can have none
but a commoi end in view, and can differ only as
to the choice of means. In a storm at sea no one
on board can wish the ship to sink, and yet not unÂ­
frequently all go down together,'because too many
will direct and no single mind can be allowed to.
control.
5'1 INSUliil.CTION IS AGAINST TIE RIGHTS OF TIIHE
IEOPLE.
It continnes to develope that the insurrection is
largely, if not exclusively, a' war upon the first
principle of popular government-the rights: of
the people. Conclusive' evidence of this is found
in the most grave and matiirely considered public
d'ocuments, as ivell as in the general tone' of
the 'insurgents. In these documents we find
the abridgement of the existing right of suffrage,.
and the denial to the people of all right to particiÂ­
pate in the selection of public officers, except the
legislative body,: advocated with labored argu.
mentsto:prove that large control of the governÂ­
ment in the people is the source of all political
evil. d
Monarchy itself is sometimes hinted at as a
'possible riefuge from the power of the people. In
my present position I could scarcely be justified
were. I to omit raising a warning voice against
this approach' of returning despotism.
CONSIDERATION' OF. CAPITAL AND LABOR-nPOPIULA
'RIOGHTS AND POPULAR INSTITUTIONS.
It-is not' needed nor fitting here that a general
'argument 'should be made in favor of popular instiÂ­
tutions; but there is one point, with its connections,
not so lackneyed as most others, to which I ask a
brief. attention. It is the effort to place capital on
a, equal footing with, if not above labor, in the'
structure of government. It is assumed that labor
is available only in ;connection with capital; that
. nobodylabors unless somebody else owning capi-Â­
tal, somehow by the use of it, induces him to labor.
'This assumed, it is next considered whether it is
best that capital shall hire laborers, and thus inÂ­
duce them to work by their own consent, or buy
'them and drive them to it without their consent.
Having proceeded so far, it is naturally .conÂ­
'eluded that all laborers are either hired Ia-.
""torers or what we, call slaves; 'and further,
it is assumed' that whoever is once a hired
Ilaborer ' is fixed in that Condition for. life.
Now: there is no such relation between 'capi_
tal and labor as assumed,' nor, isÂ­ there


iany such thing: as a free man being fixed for.
life in the condition of a hired laborer.' Both of
these assumptions are false, and all inferences
from them are groundless. Labori; is prior.to and
independent of capital. Capital is only the fruit
of labor, and could have never existed if labor had.
not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital
and deserves much the higher consideration.
Capital has its rights which are as .:worthy
of protection as any other right. Nor is it
denied that there is, and probably always will be,
a relation between labor and capital producing
mutual benefits,. The error is in assuming that the
whole labor of a community exists within that
relation.
â€¢ A few 'men own capital, anid that.
few. avoid labor, themseves, and with their
capital hire or buy another few to labor'for them.
A large majority belong to neither class; neither,
work for othersunor have others working for themn
In most of the Southern .States a majority of the.
w'hole people of all colors are neither slaves'nor
imasters, while in the Northern a large majority
are neitbher hirers nor hired. fen. with their fani.
lies, wives, sons and daughters work for themÂ­
selves'on their fawms, in their houses and in their
slops, taking .the whole product to themalves,
and .asking no favors of capital on the
one hand, nor of hired laborers or slaves
on the .other.. It is not forgotten.
that a considerable number of persons mingle their
own labor with capital-that is, they labor with
their own bands and also buy or hire others to
labor for themn; but this is only a mixed and not a
distinct class. No principle stated is disturbed by
the existencelof this mixed class.
Again, as has already been said, there is not, of
necessity, any such thing as the free hired laborer
being fixed in that condition for life. Many indeÂ­
pendent men, everywhere in these States, a few
years back in their lives, werehiredlaborers. The
prudent, penniless beggar in the world labors for
wages awhile, saves a surpluis with which to buy
tools or land for himself, then labors, on his own
account-another while, and at length hires another
new 'beginer to help him. This-is the just and
generous and prosperous system which opens the
way to all; gives hope to all, and consequent enÂ­
ergy and progress and improvement of the condi-.
tion of all. No men living are more worthy to be
trusted .than those who :toil up from poverty;
none. lessÂ­ inclined to touch aught w'hich

The following is President Fillmore's proclamation
warning all citizens against participating in or leading
aid and comfort to the rumored invasion of Cuba.
From one quarter and another altogether the hunters
have the prospect of a rather ""stumpy row to hoe:""
A PROCLAMATION.
Whereas, there is reason to believe that a military
expedition is about to be fitted out in the United Slates ]
with intention to invade the Island of Cuba, a colony
of Spain, with which this country is at peace; and
whereas it is believed that this expedition is instigated
and set on foot chiefly by foreigners, who dare to make
our shores the scene of their guilty and hostile prepaÂ­
rations against a friendly power, and seek, by falsehood
and misrepresenttation to seduce our own citizens, espeÂ­
cially the young and inconsiderate, into their wicked
schtemes-an ungrateful return lor the benefits conferÂ­
red upon them by this people in permitting them to
make our country aOt usylumt from oppression, and in
flagrant abuse of tihe hospitality thus extended to
thenm:
And whereas such expeditions can only be regarded
as adventures for plunder and robbery, and must meet
the condemnation of thie civilized world, whilst they are
derogatory to the character of our country, in violation
of tile laws of nations, and expressly prohibited by our
own. Our statutes declare ""that, if any person shall,
within tile territory or jurisdiction of tile United States,
begin or set on foot, or provide or prepare the means
for any military expedilion or enterprise, to be carried
on from thence against tile territory or dominions of any
foreign Prince or State. or of any cololny, district or
people, with whom the Untited States are at peace, eveÂ­
ry person so oflending shall be deemed guilty of a high
misdemeanor, and shall be fined not exceeding three
thousand dollars, and imprisoned not more than three
years.""
Now, therefore, I have issued this, my proclamation,
warning all persons who shall connect themselves with
any such enterprise or expedition, in violation of our
laws anld national obligations, that they will thereby
subject themselves to the heavy penalties denounced
against such offence, and will forfeit their claims to the
protection of this government, or any interfer.nce on
their behalf, no matter to what extremities they may be
reduced in consequence of tleir illegal conduct. And,
therefore, I exhort all good citizens, as they regard our
national reputation, as they respect their own laws atnd
the laws of nations, as they value the blessings of peace
and the welfare of their country, to discountenance,
and by all lasful means irevent, any such enterprise;
and I call upon every cfficer of this government, civil
or military, to use all efforts in hit power to arrest for
trial and punishment every such offender against the
laws of the country.
Given under my hand tile twenty-fifth day of April,
ill the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred
and fifty-one, and the seventy-fifth of the independence
of the United States.
MILLARD FILLMORE.
By tile President,
W. S. DERRlccK, Acting Secretary of State.
The following ;terns, says the Baltimore Sun, relative
to information and movements at Washington, in cosnÂ­
nection with the contemplated Cuban invasion, are of
interest. The steam frigate Susquehanna, Capt.
Aulick, is ordered to be in readiness to frustrate the
expedition.
Tihe Spanish Minister has had a long interview with
tihe President on Friday, in relation to the meditated atÂ­
tack upon Cuba. The Secretary of War and the SecÂ­
retary of the Navy were sent for, and remained during
the interview. In addition to instructions o tihe MarÂ­
shal and other Officers, the vessels of the Homte SquadÂ­

render any attempt to reach Cuba almost, if not wholly
impossible. The Saranac is at Pensacola, and tihe Ger

the first of May.

oua FOLEIGN RELATIONS. II
While our foreign relations have n:ot at all
times during the past year been free from tl
ye.rplexity, there are no embarrassing situaÂ­ t4
tious that will not yield to the 'spirit of fairÂ­ o
ness and love of justice, whlich, joined with v
consistent firmness, characterize a truly ci
American foreign Dolicy.
My 'predeces.sr, having accepted the office
of arbitrater of the long standing Missions
boundary dispute, tendered to the president t
by the Argentine Reaublic and Brazil, it has. i
been my agreeable duty to receive the special d
envoys commissionced by those states to lay a
before me evidence and arguments, in behalf I
of their respective governments.
THE IBRAZtLIAN OUTBREAK. 3l
The outbreak of domestic hostilities, in the s
republic of Brazil found the United States t
ready to watch the interest of our citizens in t
that country, with which W\e carry on imporÂ­ T
tant commerce. Several vessels of our new a
navy are now, and for some time have been, P
stationed at Rio de Janeiro. The struggle
inge betteben the established government, F
w-hich.con.trols the machinery and the adminÂ­
istration, and. with which we maintain
friendly relations, ana certain officers of
navy, employing the vessels of their comÂ­ t
mand in an attack upon the national capital i
and chief seaport, and lacking., asait does, the 1
element of a divided administration, I have
failed to see that the insurgents .can. reasonÂ­
ably claim recognition as belligereuts. Thus
far the position of our governmen.t has been
I
that of an attentive, Dut impartial observer 1
of the unfortunate conflict. Emphasizing
our fixed policy of impartial neutrality in 1
such a condition of affairs as now exists, I
deemed it necessary t.o disavow,, in a mannear
not to be misunderstood, the unauthorized
action of our late naval commander in those
w'aters. in saluting the revolted Brazilian
admiral, being indisposed to countenance an
act calculated to give gratuitous sanction to
the local insurrection.
TlE RIELATIONS WITH CHILI.
The convention between our government
and Chili, havhin for its object the settlement
an:d-hdj'i ktmen't 6f the demauds of the two
countries against each other, has been made
effective by the organization .of the Claims
commission provided for. Tile two governÂ­
ments, failing to agree upon the third memÂ­
ber of the commission, the good offices of th.e
president of the Swiss repu.hlic were invoked
as provided in the treaty and the selection of
the Swiss representative in this country to
complete the organization was gratifying to
the United States and Chili. The veX.atious
question of the so-called legation8 asylum for
offenders against 'the state anud its laws were
presented anew in Chili by the unauthorized
action of the late United States minister in
hatrooring in his official residence two perÂ­
sons who had failed in an attempt at revoluÂ­
tion, and againrst whom criminal charges
were pending growing out of a former aborÂ­
tive distu'rbance.
The doctrine of asylum, as applied to this
case, is not sanctioned by the hest precedents.,
and when allowed tends to encourage sediÂ­
tion and strife. Under no circumstances
can. therepresent.atives of this government be
permitted under the ill-defined fictions of exÂ­
tra-territoriality, to interrupt the adminisÂ­
tration of criminal justice in the coiuftries to
which they are accredited. A temporal deÂ­
mand having been made by the Chilian govÂ­
ernment for the correction of thits conduct in
the instance mentionad, the minister was in.
.st.ructed no longer Â·to harbor ofenders.
TiE OHARiY LAW.
The legislation of last year known as the
Goary law, requiri:g the registration of all
Chinese laborers entitled to residence in the
United 8tates, and the deportation of hil not
complying with the provision of the act
within the time prescribed, met much 'opposiÂ­
tion from Chinamen in thiks country. Acting
upon the advice of eminent counselB that the
law was unpontitutional, the great mass of


uninese lauorers, pending judicial inquiry as
to its validity, in good faith declined to apply
for the certilicates required by the prescripÂ­
tions. A test upon, proceedings by habeas
corpus was brought before the Supraego
court and on May 15, 1893, a decision was
made by that tribunal sustaining the law.
Itjs believed that under the r~cent amendÂ­
ment of the act extending the time for regisÂ­
trati.on, the Chinese laborersthe.reto entitled,
who desire to reside in this country, will
now avail themselves of the renewed priviÂ­
lege thus afforded of establishing by lawful
procedure their ritht to. remain, and that
hereby the necessity of enforced deportation
may be to a great degree avoied.
A DEMIAND UPON OiINA.
It has devolved upon the United States
midiste.r at Pe:king, as dean of the diplomatic
body, and in the absence of a representative
of Sweden, and Norway, to press upon the
Chinese government reparation for the recent
murder of Swedish missionaries at Sung-Pi.
This question is of vital interest to all counÂ­
tries whose cit.izens engage in missionary
work in the interior.
TO PRVSINT T'E SALE OF ARMS TO AFRICANS.
By Article X .111, of the General Act of
B]iuss.els, signed July 2, 1890), for the .supÂ­
pression of the slave trade and the restricÂ­
tion of certain injurious commerce in the
independent states of the Congo and in the
adjacent.zone of Central Afri.ca. the United
States and the other signatory powers
agreed to adopt appropriate means for the
punishment of .persoins selling a:rms and anmÂ­
unition to the na.ti.ves, and for the confiscaÂ­
tion of the inhibited .articles. It. bein.g the
plain duty of this government to aid in supÂ­
pre-sing the nefarious trafiie, impairing as it
does the praiseworthy and civilizing efforts
now in progress in that region, I recommend
that an act be passed prohibiting the sale of
arms and intoxicants to natives in the reguÂ­
lated zone by our citizens.

ship., promptly disavowed the illegal conduct
of its officers, and expressed sincere regret for n
the occurrence. It is conidiletly anticipatedi
that a satisfactory adjustmnent will soon be C

good offices, aided in a peaceful ad:juatment,of
a the controversy involved in the first conflict.,
The large American interests established in
that country in connection with the NicaÂ­

be
company has, unfortunately, become inanÂ­
x cially seriously embarrassed, but a generous
isÂ­ treatment has been extended to it by the

government of Nicaragua. The United

aÂ­ accomplished under distinctive.ly American
auspices and its enjoyment assured not only
to the vessels of this country as a channel of
commercial commuoi.cvation between our

ill ships of the world in the interests of c.ivilizaÂ­
he tion, is a proposition which,in my judgment,
at noes not admit of question.

On

SPAIN ASBKED FOR INIEM.NiTY. t
More than ifteeon yearn ago, this governÂ­
ment preferred a claimn againstSpaniin behalf
of one of our citizenus for property seized and On
confiscated in Cuba. In 188.6 the claim was rel
ajlisted, Spain agreeing to payunc'onditionÂ­ it
uily,
as a fair indemnity, $1,500.000. A th
respectful but earnest note was recently to
addre.sedl to the Sp:inish government insistÂ­ se
ing upon prompt ululfillmnt of its long negÂ­ reT
Iectel oblipration. Other claims, preferred by ing
thie iUnited States against Spain in behalf of l
American citizens forporoperty confiscated in co
Luba, have been pending for many years. At vi
the time Spain's title to the Caroline islands gÂ°
was confirmed by arbitration that governÂ­
ment agreed that under :the rights which
had been acquired thereby Americanu miusinÂ­ mn
aries shoulc be recoguizet and respected. It or
is sincerely hoped that this pledge will be ob. of
served by allowing .our miissionar.es, who pr

OUTRnAGE IN TUUKEY. I
importanit matters have demanded attenÂ­ ti
tion in our relations with the Ottoman tt
Porte. The firing and partial destruction
by an unrestrained mob of one of the school
buildings of Anatoly college, established by $
citizens of the United States at Mareovan, d
and the apparent indifferene of the Turkish a
government to the outrage, notwitihstanding ii
the complicity of some of its officials, called It
for earnest remonstraneo, wvhich was folÂ­ o
lowed by promises of reparation and punishÂ­ 6
ment of the offenders. Indemnity for the. a
inujury to buildings has already been paid, b
permission. to rebuild given, registration of t
the school prop.erty in the name of the S
Amnercian owners secured, and efficient pro. 4
tection guaranteed. Information received of
the maltreatment suffered by an inoffensive r
American woman engaged in missionary a
work in Turkish Koordistan wasfollowed by
such representuations to the porto as
resulted in the issuance of an order of the
. punishment of her assailan!t, the removal of
a delinquent official, and the adoption of
t
measures for the protection of our citizens
f
engaged in mission and lawful work in that
quarter. Turkey complains that her ArmenÂ­
ian sat jects obtain citizenslrhi in this country
not to identify th:emselvos in good faith with
our peoule, but with the intention of returnÂ­
ing to the land of their birth and there enÂ­
gaging in sedition. This complaint is not1
wholly without foundation. A journal pubÂ­
lished in this country in the Armenian lanÂ­
r guago openly counsels its readers to arm,
organize, and participate in movements for
the subversion of Turkish authority in the
Asiatic provinces. The Ottoman government
has arnnounced its intention to expel from its
t dominion Armenians who have obtained
r naturalization in the United States since
1 1808. The right to exclude any or all classes
Sof aliens is an att.ibute of sovereignty. It is
a right asserted and to a limited exteint
enforced by the United States with the sancÂ­
Slion of our highest court. 'fhere being no
l naturralization treaty between the United
States and Turkey, our minister at ConistanÂ­
tinople has been instructed that, while recogÂ­
nieing the right of that government to seiÂ­
t force its declared policy against naturalized
n
Armenians, he is expected to protect them
from unneceessary harshness of treatment.

Just prior to the installatioa of the present

ul the only honorable course for our governÂ­

ae utive power, and recognizing all our obligaÂ­
aÂ­ tions and responsibilities growing out of any
it, changed condition brought about by our unÂ­
justifiable interference, our present minister

'er structions to that end. Thus far no inforameÂ­

s t.iations with any government with which
,
the United States has or may have diplomaic
a relations, to the end that any differences or
ars
disputes arising between the two governÂ­
ments which cannot be adjusted by diploÂ­
y matic agency may be referred to arbitration
p and be peaceably adjusted by such. means.
i April 18, 1890, the internationalÂ­ American
e conference of Washington, by resolution, exÂ­
a pressed the wish that all .controversies
between the republics of America and the
orÂ­
nations of Europe might be settled by arbiÂ­
ero tration, and recommended that the governÂ­
at ment of each nation represented in that cornÂ­
nt ference should communicate this wish to all
friendly powers. A favorable response has
been received from Great Britain in the shia e
Sof a resolution adopted by parliament July
th 16 last, cordially sympathizing with the
parpose in view, and expressing the hope
(g. that her majesty's government will lend
Sa ready co-operation to the government of the
ore United States upon the basis of the concurÂ­

me
id
signal pleasure to lay this parliamentary
resolution before the congress, and to express
abr my gratification that the sentiment of two

The broad foundation upon which our Constitution that
rests being the People-a breath of theirs having made, final
as a breath can unmake, change, or modify it-it can be veto
assigned to none of the great divisions of Government, vote

but to that of Democracy.: If such is its theory, those nega
who are called upon to administer it must recognize, .s tive
its leading principle, the duty of shaping their measures woul
so as to produce the greatest good to the greatest number. somt
I But, with these broad admissions, if we would compare be h
the sovereignty acknowledged to exist in the mass of our ance
People; with the power claimed by other sovereignties, it ml
:ven by those which have been considered most purely the I
| lemocratic, we shall find a most essential difference.Â­ form
Ai 11 others lay claim to power limited only by their own pear
, will. The majority of our citizens, on the contrary, pos. men
sees a sovereignty with an amount'of power precisely was
equal to that which has been granted to them by the par. tive
ties to the national compact, and nothing beyond. We enei
es
admit of no Government by divine right. Believing ado
sh that, so far as power is concerned, the Beneficient CreaÂ­ lead
tor has made no distinction amongst men, that all are upÂ­ vern
on an equality, and that the only legitimate right to go. it
g vern is an express grant of power from the gverned.Â­ The
ka
The Constitution of the United States is the instrument exis
d containing this grant of power to the several departments of t
composing the Government. On an examination of that den
instrument it will be found to contain declarations of wor
is power granted and of power withheld. The latter is alÂ­ that
en
so susceptible of division into power which the majority rinl
d, had the right to grant, but: which they did not think propÂ­ try
er to intrust to their agents, and that which they could a th
to not have granted, not being possessed by themselves. In the
riÂ­ other words, there are certain rights possessed by each inÂ­ con
dividual American citizen, which, in his compact with the
the others, he has never surrendered. Some of them, in. ape
deed, he is unable to surrender, being in the language of the
ed
our system unalienable. The boasted privilege of a RoÂ­ the
te man citizen was to him a'shield only against a petty proÂ­ or (
r. vincial ruler, whilst the proud democrat of Athens could not
e console himself under a sentence of death, for a supposed vet
violation of the national faith, which no one understood, ode
and which at times was the subject of the mockery of all, the
es or the banishment from: his home, his family and his we
ite country, with or without an alleged cause; that it was del
the act, not of i single tyrant or hated aristocracy, but of sur
his assembled cotintrymen. Far different is the power of pet
- our sovereignty. It cam interfere with no one's faith, eit
prescribe forms of worship for no one's observance, inflict gre
no punishment but afterlwell ascertained guilt, the result as
of investigation under firms prescribed by the Constitu. ap
reÂ­ tion itself. These precious priv;leges, and those scarcely tie
%eÂ­ less important, of giving expression to his thoughts and ha
but opinions, either by writing or speaking, unrestrained but
rth by the liability for injury to others, atnd that of a full parÂ­ pr
ticipation in all the advantaces which flow from the GoÂ­ im
0oÂ­ vernment, the acknowledged property of all, the AmeriÂ­ th
hat can citizen derives from no charter granted by his fellow. tic
'ens
man. lie claims them because he is himself a man, co
coÂ­ fashioned by the same Almighty hand as the rest of his co
the species, and entitled toaa full share of the blessings with an
sinÂ­ which he has endowed them. Notwithstanding the limiÂ­ fri
the ted sovereignty possessed by the People of the United re
Lion States, and the restricied grant of power to the GovernÂ­ tii
preÂ­ ment which they have adopted, enough has been given to th
nds accomplish all the objects for which it was created. It ai
oon has been found power ul in war, and hitherto, justice has ty
been administered, ait intimate union effected, domnestic di
tranquility preserved; and personal liberty secured to thie a
citizen. As was to he expected, however, from the de-. ci
ia.n feet of language, and the necessarily sententious smanner p
in which the Constitution is written, disputes have arisenrr
day,
to the amot.nt of power which it has actually granted, to
I
r w vas intended to grant. p

claimed ,tndor a ge;eral clause. giviner that body the an. n


Ithor ity to a.'s all laws necessary to carry into effect the c
roÂ­ specified powers, btut in relation to the latter, also. It is, F
pro
however, conolator' to reflect, that most of the instances /
of alleged departure from the letter or spirit of the ConÂ­ ii
stitution, have ultinrately received the sanction of a maÂ­ n
m, jority of the people. And the fact that many of our t
statesmen, most distinguished for talent and patriotism, a
lace. have been, at one time or other of their political career, p
imes on both sides of each of the most warmly disputed
nder qaestions, forces upon us the inference that the errors,
if errors they were, are attributable to the intrinsic f
John
difficulty, in many instances, of ascertaining the inten. -
tionsof the framers of the Constitution, rather than the I
influence of any sinister or unpatriotic motive. But the c
g eatdanger to our institutions does not appear to me to t
the bein a usurpation by the government of power not grantÂ­ I
ed by the people, but by the accumulation, in one of the t
departments, of that which was assigned to others.-Â­
Limited as are the powers which have been granted, still t
other eno-h have been granted to constitute a despotism, if I
from concentrated in one of the departments. This danger is
'd
the greatly heightened, as it has been always o-servable that
le
ex*
men are less jealous of encroachments of one department
nd oa upon another, than upon their own reserved rights.Â­
e hen the Constitution of the United States first came
ol from the hands of the Convention which formed it, many
rlies of the sternest Republicans of the day were alarmed at
s te.e extent of the power which had been granted to the
tn fede ral government, and more particularly, of that orÂ­
g ion w,.'nch had bepn assigned to the executive brnnct.Â­

their systems of Government which may be calculated to in part
create or increase the love of power, in the bosoms of to itm
those to whom necessity obliges them to commit the man. distrib

likely to produce such a state of mind than the long conÂ­ pated i

ter, and in times of great exeitement imposes itself upon
The oeople as the genuine spirit of freedom, and, like the
false Chriets, whose coming was foretold by the Saviour,
seeks and were it possible would impose upon the true
and ,nost faithful disciples of liberty. It is in periods
like this that it behooves the people to be most watchful
of those to whom they have entrusted power. And al.
though there is at times much Iiflieulty in distinguishing
the false from the true spirit, a calm and dispassionate in.

and tolerant, and scrupulous as to the means it employs.
whilst the spirit of party, asanming to be that of liberty,
is harsh, vindicative and intolerant, and totally reckless
as to the character of the allies which it brings to the aid
of its cause. When the genuine spirit of liberty ani.

pristine health and beauty. But the reign of an intoleÂ­
rent spirit of party, amongst a free people, seldom fails to
result in a dangerous accession to the Executive power..
introduced and established amidst unusual professions of
devotion to Democracy.
The foregoing remarks relate, almost exclusively, to
matters connected with our domestic concerns. It may
be proper, however, that I should give somue indications to.
my fellow-citizens of my proposed course of conduct ins
the management of our foreign relations. I assure them,
therefore, that it is my intention to use every meansinmy
power to preserve the friendly intercourse which now so'
happily subsists with every foreign nation. And that alÂ­
though, of course, not well informed as to the state of
pending negotiations with any of them, I see, in the perÂ­
sonal characters of the Sovereigns, as well as in the muÂ­
tual interest of our own and of the Governments with
which our relations are most intimate, a pleasing guaranÂ­
ty that the harmony so important to the interests of their
subjects, as well as our citizens, will not be interrupted
by the advancement of any claim, or pretension upon
their part to which our honor would not permit us to yield.
Long the defender of my country's rights in th field, I
trust that my fellow-citizens will not see in tmy earnest
desire to preserve peace with foreign Powers any indicaÂ­
tion that their rights will ever be sacrificed, or the honor
of the nation tarnished, by any admission on the part of
their Chief Magistrate unworthy of their former glory.
In our intercourse with our Aboriginal neighbors, the
same liberality and justice, which marked the course preÂ­
scribed to me by two of our illustriosu predecessors,
when acting under their direction in the discharge of ths
dutnes of Superintendent and Commissioner, shall be
strictly ob'scrved. I can conceive no more sublime sec.
ticle, none more likely to propitiate an impartial and comÂ­
mon Creator, than a rigid adherence to the principles of
justice on the part of a powerful nation in its tran:sactions
with a weaker and uncivilized people, whom circumÂ­
stances have placed at its disposal.
Belore concluding, fellow citizens, I must say some.
thing to you on the subject of the parties at this time exÂ­
isting in our country. To merit appears perfectly clear,
that the interest of that country requires that the violence
of the spirit by which tlhoze partis are at thistime governÂ­
ed mmst be greatly mitigated, if not entirely distinguishÂ­
ed, or consequences will ensue which are appalling to be
thought cf.
If patties in a Republic are necessary to secure a degree
of vigilance sufficient to keep the public functioaries withÂ­
in the bounis of law and duty, at that point their.uiefulness
ends: beyond that, then become destructive of public virtue,
the parent of a spitit antagonist to that of liberty, and evenÂ­
tually its inevitable conqueror. We have eeitamples of lReÂ­
publics, where the love of country and of liberty at one
time, were the dominant passions of the whole mass of citiÂ­
zens, and yet, with the contincuance of the name and forms
of free government, not a vestige of these qualities remained
in the bosoms of any one of its citizens. It was the beautiful
remark of a distinguished English writer, that ""in the Ro.
tmatn Senate Octavius had a party, but the Comm mnwealth
Ilad none."" Yet the Senate continued to meet in the TemÂ­
iple of Liberty, to talk of the sacredness and beauty of the
SConmnonwealth, and gaze at the statues of the elder Bru :us
and of the Curtii and Dclii; antd the penople assembled in
- the forum, not as in the daysof Camillus antd of the Scipios,
to cast their free votes far annual magistrates, or pass upon
the acts of the senate, but to receive from the hands of the
,f
leaders of the respective parties their share of the spoils,
d
and to shout for th1:e one or the other, as those collected in
Gaul, or Egypt, and the Lesser Asia, would furnish the
o larger dividend. The spirit of liberty had fled, and, aÂ­
,r voiding the abodes of civil zed man, had cought protec.
-ion in the wilds of Scythia or Scandinavia; and so, unÂ­
5 der the operation of the same causes and influences, it
d will fly from our Capital and our forums. A calamity so
ÂºÂ­ awful, not only to our country, but to the world, must be
r, deprecated by every patriot; and every tendency to a
state of things likely to produce it immediately checked.
u Stich a tendency has existed-does exist.
aÂ­
Always the friend of my countrymen, never their flatÂ­
uÂ­
terer, it becomes my duty to say to them from this high
to place to which their partiality has exalted me, that there
eÂ­ exists in the land a spirit hostile to their best inter eatsÂ­
rÂ­ hostile to liberty itself. It is a spirit contracted in its
te views, selfish in its object. It looks to the aggrandiseÂ­
is ment of a few, even to the destruction of the interests of
nÂ­ the whole. The entire remtedy is with the People.-Â­
er Something, however, may be effected by the means which
is they have placed in my hands. It is union that we want,

tip his judgment and his sense of duty to those from whom
se lhe holds his appointtraent; nor any confidence in advance


to from the People, but that asked for by Mr Jefferson, ""to
all give firmness and effect to the legal administration of their
tot affairs.""

ar.Â­ solemn to justify me in expressing to my fellow citizensa
profound reverence for the Christian Religion, and a thoÂ­
Less

by sailing to the colonies in 1020,
refused to submit to tyranny even from
the grand Monarque. Gen eral Garfield
delighted to dwell on these traits, and
during his only visit to England, he
himself, discovered every trace of his
forefathers in a parish register and on
ancient army rolls. (Sitting with a
iriend in the gallery of the House of
Commons one Might, after a long days
labor in this fiehf of research, he said,
with evident elation, that ""in every war
which for three centuries the patriots
of England had struck sturdy blows for
constitutional government and human
liberty, his family had been representÂ­
ed."" They were at Bunker Hill, at
Saratoga and at Monmouth, and his
own person had battled for the same
great cause in the war which preserved
the Union of the States Loosing his
father before he was two years old, the
early life of Garfield was one of privaÂ­
tion, but his poverty has been made inÂ­
delicately and unjustly prominent.
Thousands of readers have imagined
him as a rasced, starving child, whose
reality too oiten greets the eyres in the
squalid sections of our large cities
General Garfield's infancy and youth
had none pf their destitution ; none of
their fitful future appealing to the tenÂ­
der heart and open hand of charity.
He was in the same sense in which HenÂ­
ry Clay was a poor boy; in which AnÂ­
drew Jackson and Daniel Webster were
poor boys ; in the same sense m which
a large majority of the eminent men of
America, in all generations, have been
poor boys. Before a great : mulÂ­
titude of men, in a public
speech, Mr. Webster bore this
testimony. It did not happen
to me to be born in a log cabin, but my
elder brothers and sisters were born in
a log cabin, and raised amid the snow
drifts of New Hampshire at a period so
early that when the smoke rose first
from its crude chimney and curled over
the frozen hills, there was no similar
evidence of a white man's habitation
between it and the settlements on the
rivers of Canada. Its remains still exÂ­
ist, and I make to it an annual visit.
I carry my children to it to teach them
the hardships endured by the generaÂ­
tions which have gone before them. I
love to dwell on the tender recollection
of kindred ties of early affiliations, the
touching narrative and incidents which
mingle with all I know of this family
abode. With requisite change of scene
these same words would strictly apply
to the early days of Garfield. The povÂ­
erty of the frontier, where all are enÂ­
gaged in a common struggle, and
where a common sympathy anil hearty
co-operation lighten the burden of
each, is a very different poverty indeed,
different in kind, different in influence
and effect than that censorious and huÂ­
miliating condition which is every day
forced to contrast itself with neighborÂ­
ing wealth on which it feels a sense of
grinding dependence, and has the
boundless possibility of the future alÂ­
ways opening before it. No man in the
agricultural regions of the west where
a house raising or even a com husking
is a matter ot common interest and
helpfulness, has any other feeling than
that of broad minded, generous indeÂ­
pendence. This honorable indepen
dence marked the youth of Garfield, as
it marks the youth of millions of
the befit blood and brain now training
ior me iuturo eiiizcnsnip ami luture
government of the republic. Garfield
was born an heir to the land, to the
title of freeholder, which has been the
patent and passport of self respect
with the Anglo-Saxon race evere since
Hengist and llorsa landed on the shores
of England. His adventure on the
canal as an alternative between that
and the deck of a Lake Erie schooner,
was a iar . better device lor earning
money, just as me jnow JMigianu Doy

circumstances, and no man ieeis a
worthier pride than he.who has con

The Inaugural Address.
A procession was formed and proceeded
to the platform on the east capitol steps
where the oath of office was administered
by Chief Justice' Fuller and President
Harrison delivered the following address:
Fellow Citizens: There is no constitutional or
legal ; requirements that the President shall
take the oath of office in the presence of tbe
people. But there is so manifest an appro
priateness in the public induction to office of
tho chief executive officer of the Nation that
from the beginning of the Government tbe peoÂ­
ple to whose . service the official oath conseÂ­
crates the officer, have been called to witness
the solemn ceremonial.
The oath taken in tbe presence of the people
bee- mes a mutual covenant the officer coven
ants to sei ve the whole body of the people by a
faithful execution of the laws, so that they
may be the unfailing defense and security of
those who respect and observe them, and that
neither wealtb, station, nor the power of com
binations snail be able to evade their just
penalties or to wrest them from a beneficent
public purpose to servo the ends of cruelty or
selfishness.
My promise is spoken, yours unspoken but
not the less real and solemn. The people of
every State have here, their representatives.
Surely I do not misinterpret this occasion
when I assume that the whole body of the peoÂ­
ple covenant with me and with each other toÂ­
day to support and defend the Constitution and
the Union of the States, to yield willing obediÂ­
ence to all the laws and each to every other citÂ­
izen his equal civil and political rights.
Entering thus solemnly into covenant with
each other we may reverently invoke and conÂ­
fidently expect the favor and help of Almighty
God that He will give to me wisdom, strength
and fidelity and to our people a spirit of frater
nity and a love of righteousness and peace. '
This occasion derives peculiar interest from
the tact that tbe Presidential ter n which be
gins this day is tbe twenty-sixth under our
Constitution. The first inauguration of PresiÂ­
dent Washington took place in New York.
where Congress was then sitting, on the SDth
day of April, 1789, having been deferred by
reason of delays attending the organization of
Congress and the anvass of the Electoral vote.
Our people have already worthily observed the
centennial of the Declaration of Independence,
of the battle of Yorktown and of the adoption
of the Constitution: and Willi shortly celebrate
in New York the institution of the second great
department of our constitutional sceme of
government. When the centennial of the Insti
tution of the judioial department by the organÂ­
ization of the Supreme Court shall have -been
suitably observed, as I trust it will e, our NaÂ­
tion wilt have fully entered its second century.
I will not attempt to note the marvelous and,
in great part, happy contrasts between our
country as it steps over the threshold of its
second century of organized existence under
the Constitution, and that weak . but wisely or
dered young Nation that looked undauntedly
down the first century, -when all its years
stretched out before it. .
Our people will not fail at this time to recall
the Incidents which accompanied the instituÂ­
tion of government under the Constitution or
to find inspiration and guidance in the teachÂ­
ings and example of Washinutoa and his great
associates and hope and courage in the conÂ­
trast which thirty-eight populous and prosperÂ­
ous States offer to the thirteen States, - weak in
every tiling except courage and the love of libÂ­
erty, that then fringed our Atlantic seaboard.
1 The Territory of Dakota has, now a population
greater than any of the original States (except

Virginia), and greater , than the esspregste of

five or the smaller States In ITS
. The center . of population, when our National
capital was located, was east of Baltimore, and
it was argued by many well informed persons
that it would move eastward rather than westÂ­
ward. Yet, in 1880 it was found to be near CinÂ­
cinnati and tbe new. census about to be taken
will show another stride to the westward.
That which was the body has come s be only
tbe rich fringe of the Nation's robe. :. .-But
our growth has not been limited to tcrl
tory, population and great wealth, marvelous
as it has been .In each of those directions.
Tbe masses of our people have been better fed.
clothed- and housed than their fathers
were. The facilities for popular education
have been vastly enlarged and more generally

ence and increasing power in the hearts and

The sweet offices ot chanty have greatly in-
Th Eastern, Port co of the Capitol.
creased. The virtue of temperance is held in
higher , estimation. We have not attained an
ideal condition. Not all of our people are happy
and prosperous: not all of them are virtuous
and law-abiding. But on the whole, the opporÂ­
tunities offered tbe individual to secure the
comforts of life are better than are found elseÂ­
where and largely better than they were here
HiO years ago.
The surrender of a large measure of sovereign
ity to the General Government effected by thÂ­
adoption ot the Constitution was not jiccouv
plished until the suggestions of reason were
strongly reinforced by the more imperative
voice of experience. . ' ."" - .
The divergent interests of peace speedily deÂ­
manded ""a more perfect union."" The merÂ­
chant, the shipmaster and the manufacterer
discovered and disclosed to our statesmen and
to tbe people that commercial emancipation
must be added to the political freedom which
had been o bravely won. The commercial polÂ­
icy of the mothercountry bad not relaxed any
of its ard and oppressive features. To hold in
check the development of our commercial maÂ­
rine, to prevent or retard the establishment and
growth of manufactures in the States, a d so
to secure the American market for their ships,
and the carrying trade for tt.eir ships, was the
policy of European statesmen, and was purÂ­
sued with the most selfish vigor.'-'
Petitions poured in upon Congress urging the
imposition of discriminating duties that should
encourage the production of needed things at
home. Tbe patriotism of the people which no
longer found a field of exercise in. war was en
ergetically directed to the duty of equipping the
young Republic for the defense of its independ
ence by making its people self dependent. So
cieties for the promotion of home manufactures
and for encouraging the use of dome tics in the
dress of the people were organized in many of
the States. Many of the revivals at the end of
a century of the patriotic interest in the de
velopment of domestic industries and the de
fense of the working people against injurious
foreign competition, is an incident worthy of atÂ­
tention. It is not a departure but a return
what we have witnessed. . The nrotective pol
icy had then its opponents. The argument was
made as now that its benefits inured to particuÂ­
lar classes or sections.
If the question became in any sense or at any
time sectional it was only because slavery ex
isted in some of the States. . But for this, there
was no reason why the cotton-producing States
should not have led or walked abreast with the
New England States in the production of eo ton
tabrics. There was this ' reason only why the
States that divide with Pennsylvania the min
eral treasures of the. great southeastern and
centrl mountain ranges should have been so
tardy in bringing to the smelting furnace and to
the mill the coal and iron from their opposing
hill sides.
Mill fires were lighted at the funereal pile ot
slavery. Tbe emancipation proclamation was
heard in the depths of the earth as well as in
the sky, men were made free and material
tbin s becam our better servants. . - .
The sectidnal element has happily been elim
inated from the tariff discussion. We have no
longer States that are necessarily only planting
states, none are excluded from achieving that
diversification of pursuit among the people
which brings wealth and contentment.. ' The
cotton plantation w.U not be less valuable when
tbe produ t is spun in the country town by
operatives whose necessities call for diversified
crops and create a home demand for
garden and agricultural products. Every
new mine, furnace and factory is an extension
of the productive capacity of a State more real
and valuable than added territorr. ' '
Shall tbe prejudices and paralysis of slavery
continue to hang upon the skirts of progress?
How long will those, who rejoice that slavery
President Harrison Taking the Oath.
no longer exists, cherish and tolerate the inÂ­
capacities it put upon their communities?
I look hopefully to the continuance of our pro
tective system and to the consequent developÂ­
ment of manufacturing, and mining enterprises
in the States hitherto wholly given to aeri cult
ure as a potent influence in tbe perfect unificaÂ­
tion of our people. The men who have invested
their capital in these enterprises, the farmers
who have felt the benefit of their neighborhood
and the men who work in shops or field, will not
fail to find and to defend a community of interÂ­
est.Is it not quite possible that the farmers and
the promoters of the g$eat mining and manuÂ­
facturing enterprises which have recently been
established in the South, may yet find that tbe
tree ballot or the working man. . without disÂ­
tinction of race, is needed for their defense as
well as for his own ? I do not doubt that if these
men of tbe South who now - accept the tariff
views of Clay and the constitutional expositions
of Webster, would courageously avow and de
fend their real convictions, they would not find
it difficult, by friendly, instruct on and coÂ­
operation to make the black man their efficient
and safe ally not only in establishing cor
rect principles in our National Administration,
but in preserving, ror their local, communities,
the benefits of social order and economical and
honest government. At least natil 'the good
offices of kindness and education have.-been
tairly tried, the contrary conclusion can net' be
plausibly urged - . : .v
I have altogether rejected the suggestion ot
a special ex entire policy for any section of our
country It is the duty of the executive to adÂ­
minister and enforce, in the methods and by
the instrumentalities pointed out and provided

by tie Constitution, all the . laws enacted by
Congress. These laws are general and their
administration should be uniform and equal. As
a citizen may not elect what laws he will obey,
neither may , the executive elect wcicn
he will enforce. The duty to obey and
execute embraces the Constitution in its enÂ­
tirety. and the whole code of laws enacted under
it. Tbe evil example of permitting individuals,
corporations and communities to nullify the
laws because they cross some selfish or local
interests or prejudices. Is full of danger not
only to the Nation at large, but much more to
.those who use this pernicious expedient to esÂ­
cape their just obligations or to obtain an unÂ­
just '6.?antage over others. They will presentÂ­
ly themselves be compelled to appeal to the
law for protection and those who would use
the law as a defense must not deny the use ot
it to others. T
If our (treat oorporattens would more scrupuÂ­
lously observe their leeal imitations and duties,
they would have less cause t& complain of the
unlawful limitations of their rights or of violent
interference with their operations. The comÂ­
munity that by concert, open or secret, smong
its citizens denies to a portion of its members
their plain rights under the law has severed the
only safe bond of social order and prosperity.
The evil works from a bad center both ways.
It demoralize those who practice it, and deÂ­
stroys the faith of those who suffer by it in the
efficiency of the law as a safe protector. The
man in whose breast that faith has been darkÂ­
ened is naturally the subject of dangerous and
uncanny suggestions. Those who use unlawful
methods, if moved by no higher motive than
the selfishness that prompted them may well

stop and inquire what is to be the end of this.
An unlawful expedient can not become a per
manent condition of government- If the edu
cated and influential classes in a community
either practice or connive at the systematic
violation of laws that seem to them to cross .
their convenience, what can they expect
when the lesson that convenience or
a supposed class interest is a sufficient cause
for lawlessness has been well learned by tbe
ignorant classes? A ' community where law is
the rule of conduct and where courts, not mobs,
execute its penalties, is the only - ttractive field
for business investments and honest labor.
Our naturalization laws should be so amended
as to make the inquiry into the character and
good disposition of persons applying for citizen
ship more ca ef ul and searching. Our existing
laws have been in their administration an un
impressive land, often an untelligible
form, we accept tbe man as a citizen
without any knowledge of his fitness and he
assumes the duties of citizenship without
any knowledge as to what they are. The privi
leges of the American citizenship are so great
and its duties so grave that we may well insist
on a good knowledge of every person applying
for citizenship and a good knowledge by him of
our institutions. We should not cease to be
hospitable to immigration, but we should cease
to be careless as to the character of it. There
are men of all races, even the best, whose c om
ing is necessarily a burden upon our public
revenues or a threat to social order. - These
should be identified and ex luded.
We have happily maintained a policy of avoid
ing all interference with European affairs. ' We
have been only - interested spectators of their
content! ns in diplomacy and war, ready to use
our friendly offices to promote peace but never
obtruding our advice and never attemptin unÂ­
fairly to coin the distresses of other powers in
to commercial advantage to ourselves. We
have a just right to expect that our European
policy will be the American policy of
The Bevievung Stand.
European courts. It is so - manifestly
incompatible with those precautions for our
peace and safety which all the great powers
habitual y observe and enforce in matters afÂ­
fecting them that a shorter water way between
our eastern and western seaboards, should be
dominated by any European Government that
we may confidently expect that such a purpose
will not be entertained by any friendly power.
We shall in the future as in the past use every
endeavor to maintain and enlarge friendly relaÂ­
tions with all the great Powers, but they will
not expect us to look kindly upon any project
that would leave us subject to the dangers of a
hostile observation or environment.
We have not sought to dominate or absorb
any of our weaker neighbors, but rather to aid
and encourage them to establish free and staÂ­
ple Governments, resting upon the consent of
their own people. We have a clear right to exÂ­
pect therefore, that no European Government
will seek to establish colonial dependenci s
upon the territory of those Independent AmerÂ­
ican States. That which a sense of justice re
strains us from seeking they may be reasonaÂ­
bly willing to f rego.
It must not be assumed, however, that our
interests are so exclusively American that our
entire in ttention to any event that may trans
pire elsewhere can be taken for granted. Our
citizens domiciled for the purpose of trade in
all countries and in many of the islands of the
sea, demand and will have ur adequate care in
their personal and commercial rights.
The necessities of our navy require convenient
coaling stations and dock and harbor priviÂ­
leges. These and other tra ing privileges we
will feel free to obtain only by means that do
not in any degree partake of coercion however
feeble the Government from which we ask such
concessions. But, having fairly obtained them
by methods and for purposes entirely consist
ent with the most friendly disposition toward
all other powers, our consent will be necessary
to any modification or impairment of the conÂ­
cession. x ,
We shall neither fail to respect the flag of
any friendly Nation or the just rights to its
citizens, nor to exact the like treatment of our
own. Calmness, justice and consideration
should characterize our diplomacy. .The offices
of an intelligent diplomacy or of friendly arbiÂ­
tration in proper cases should be adequate to
the peaceful adjustment of all international
difficulties. By such methods we will make
ur contribution to the world's peace, which no
Nation values more highly, and avoid the opÂ­

The duty devolved by law upon the President
to nominate, and by and with the advice and
consent of the Senate to appoint all public
officers whose appointment is not otherwise
provided for in the Constitution or by act of
Congress, has becone very burdensome, and its
wise and efficient discharge full of difficulty.
The civil list is so large that a personal knowlÂ­
edge of any large number of tbe applicunts'is
impossible. The President must rely upon the
representations of others, and these are often
made inconsiderately , ind without any Just
sense of responsibility. . : L ' -Jz
I nave a right, I think, to insist that those
who volunteer or are invited to give advice as
to appointments shall exercise consideration
and fidelity. A high sense of duty and ambition
to improve the service should .characterize all
public officers. There are many ways in which
the convenience and comfort pf those who have
business with our public offices may be proÂ­
moted by a thoughtful and obliging officer, and
I shall expeet those whom I may appoint to
justify their selection by a conspicuous eOcÂ­
iency in the discharge of their dutfoa.

While a treasury surplus is not the greatest
evil, it is a serious eviL Our revenue should be
I ample to meet the ordinary annual demands
upon our treasury with a sufficient margin for
those extraordinary, but scarcely less ImperaÂ­
tive, demands which arise now and then. Ex
penditures should always be made with econÂ­
omy and only on publie necessity. WastefulÂ­
nee, profligacy and favoritism in public ex
penditures is criminal. Bat there is nothing in
the condition of our country or of our people to
suggest that any thing presen-ly necessary to
the public prosperity, security or honor should
be unduly postponed.
It will be the duty of Congress wisely to fore
cast and estimate the extraordinary demands.
and having added them to our ordinary expend
itures to exhaust our revenues that no' consid
erable annual surplus will remain.
We will fortunately be able to apply to the
redemption of the publie debt any small or unÂ­
forseen excess of revenue This. is better
than to reduce our income below our necessary
expenditures with the resulting choice between
another change of our revenue . laws and an in
crease of the publie debt. ' It is quite possible.
I am sure, to effect the necessary reduction in
our revenues without breaking down our proÂ­
tective tariff or seriously injuring any. domestic
interests -. -.""' "" v .

We should encourage the establishment of
American steamship lines. Tbe exchanges of

It is a subject of congratulation that there is
a near prospect of the admission into the Union
of tbe Dekotas and Montana and Washington
Territories. This act of justice has been un
reasonably delayed in the case of some of them.
The people who have settled these Territories
are ntelligent, enterprising and patriotic and
the access of these new States will sdd strength
to tne Nation. . .. .
It is due to the settlers in the Territories who
have availed themselves of the invitations of
our land 1 ws to moke homes upon tbe public
domain that their titles should be speedily ad

. It is very gratifying to observe the general
interest now being manifested in the reform of
our election laws. Those who have been for
years calling attention to the pressing necessity
of throwing about the ballot box and about the
elector further safeguards, in order that, our
elections might not only be free and pure but
might clearly appear to be so, will welcome the
accession oi any . wno aid not so soon

gives it jurisdiction, but has accepted .'and

oi tne state laws or an unfair or partisan adÂ­
ministration of them could smnrest a departure
rrom this policy, it was clearly, however, in
tbe contemplation of the framers of. the Con
stitution that such an exigency might arise, and
provision was wisely made for it. Tbe freedom
f the ballot is a condition or our National life
and no power vested in Congress or in the ex
ecutive to secure or per eiuate it, should re
main unused upon occasion. -
The people of all the Congressional districts
have an equal interest that the election in each
shall truly express the views and wishes of a
majority of the qualified electors residing within
it. The results of such elections are not local,
and the insistence of electors residing in other
districts that they shall be .pure and free do s
not savor at all of impertinence. If, in any of
the States the public t-ecurity is thought
to be threatened v ie-no ranee atnnnir
the electors, the obvious remedy is educaÂ­
tion. The sympathies and help of our peo
ple will not be withheld from any community

are promoted by just and honorable methods
How shall those who practice election frauds
recover that respect for the sanctity of the balÂ­
lot which, is the first condition and obligation of
good citizenship? The man who has come to re
gard the ballot box as a juggler's hat has reÂ­
nounced his allegiance.
Let us exalt patriotism and moderate our
party contentions. ""Let those who would die
for the flag on the field of battle, give a better
proof of their patriotism and a higher glory to

fair methods or by practices that partake of rev
olution is hurtful and evanescent even from a

should accept an adverse judgment with the

Tne rain had abated somewhat and taken
from thousands of umbre.las and ran in
rivulets down the backs of those-unfortunates
who did not possess these
useful implements. Despite all of the unÂ­
toward surrounding's the crowd preserved
its good humor, and pased the long inter
val in Aiming jokes and, jibes at self imÂ­
portant and isolated members of .the paÂ­
rading organizations, who were hurrying
along in undisuified baste, to join their
comrades. Finally the head of the great
procession turned into Pennsylvania aveÂ­

interest ceased iu. all else. . v - . !
.Forty-eight years ago .William Henry
Harrison, on his while horse, headed a
procession of 4,000 patriots on this same
route. At that time Admiral Porter, then
a Lieutenant, said that it was the finest
pageant in the world. , Yesterday probÂ­
ably 4-1. (XX) men were in line to honor the
grandson, many of them coming?-from
sections of the country which in 1841 were
uninhabitated tracts of territory. The
elements warred upon them, but they held
their own bravely.
Liook'ng eastward from tbe treasury
with the Capitol forming a hazy, yet
stately background, the sight was inspirÂ­
ing. The broad expanse of the avenue
glistened beneath the dull sky, and, like
giant mushrooms, the umbrellas of tbe
multitude covered the sidewalks. The
crowds strained against the confining
cable, but the wire held firmly and the
avenue was kept clear f r the troops, i
General Beaver rode in advance and his
head was uncovered a great part ' of the
time in acknowledgment of the greeting
of the great multitude. The long line of
troops and militia and civilians with banÂ­
ners and guidons flying in the northern
wind completely filled the. vision, ita
marching step varying with the time of
the numerous bands of music. . Over all
was heard a continuous roar made up with
the voices of. thousands and thousands of
spectators as they cheered the Presidential
party or greet. 1 some particularly fine
locking body of troops. -
When the head of the procession reached
the treasury a halt was called and the
Presidential party in its two - carriages
turned off and drove rapidly to the White
House.-'
When a hasty luncheon had been taken
the party, with the exception of Mr.
Cleveland, repaired to the reviewing stand
and the President and the Vice-President
had their first view of the grand pageant
in which they had taken s conspicuous a
part. .
The stand at this time was filled with
tbe exception of the seats reserved for the
President's party. When, the President
and Vice-President took .their places at
the front of the stand they were at once
recognized by the crowd gathered beneath
them and a mighty shout rent the air.

the crowd and the cheer ng lasted forsev-

bowed right, and -left to the crowd. They
stood side by side and the- remainder of
the party took seats behind them. ' (
The review began immediately after the
President's arrival. General Beaver,
chief marshal, headed the line, with GenÂ­
eral Hastings as chief of staff, followed
by a great number or aides.' As they apÂ­
proached they bared thir heads and gave
the President a marching salute. The
President and Mr. Morion returned the
complment by removing their hats. At
the same time the band played ""Hail to
the Chief"" and the crowd cheered voÂ­
ciferously.The first division presented a splendid
appearance. It was composed of United
States troops.-marines, naval apprentices
and the National Guard of the District.
The President recogn'xed the salute of
each commanding officer, by raising his
hat and he also uncovered his head a each
flag was dipped in salute. He spoke freÂ­
quently to Mr. Morton in commentation
of the marching of the different regiments
and inquired particularly as to the identity
of Colonel Cecil Clay, commanding the
Second District regiment, who raised an
empty sleeve in giving the uual salute.
The National Guard of Pennsylvania
composed the Secon 1 division. "" It was
commanded by Major-General John J.
Hartranft, and as usual, when the? guard
has ar peered at the cpil. it created a
sensation. The perfect n-gnment of the
marching columns, as they passed the
President's stand, the soldierly bearing of
tbe men, and their 'ready for any emerÂ­

mixed-up condition of his kinsfolk in his own

words. lie says, I married a widow who had

a grown-up daughter. My father visited our

house very often, fell in love with my step-

daughter, and married her. So my father

became my son-in-law, and my step-daughter

my mother, because she was my fathems wife.

Some time afterwards, my wife gave birth to a

son; he was my fathers brother-in-law, and my

uncle, for he was the brother of my step-mother.

My fathers wife  i.e. my step-daughter  had

also a son he; was, of course, my brother, and in

the mean time my grandchild, for he was the son

of my daughter. My wife was my grandmother,

because she was my mothers mother. I was my

wifes husband and the grandchild at tIme same

time. And as the husband of a persons grand-

mother is his grandfather, I was my own

grandfather. After this logical conclusion,

we are not surprised that the unfortunate man

should have taken refuge in oblivion. It was

the most married family and the worst mixed

standing all that Lord Byron asyl |:
George Sand have said in regard to it lfcf'

and putting food and fodder into the
troughs of a herd of iniquities that root

and wallow in the soul or man is a very j
poor business lor men and women inr
tended to be sons and daughters of ihe ;
Lord Almighty. And when this young
man resolved to go home it was a very :
wise thing for him to do, and the only
question is whether we will follow him. :
L Satan promises large wages if we will :

man of the text was wise when ""he uttered
the resolution, ""I will arise and go

to my father.""
In the time ot Mary the Persecutor,
a persecutor came to a Christion woman i
who had hidden in her house for the
Lord's sake one of Christ's servants,
and the persecutor said, ""Where"" is that
heretic?'7 The Christian woman said.
^ ""You open that trunk, and you will see
the heretic."" The persecutor opened
the trunk, and cn the top of the linen of
the trunk he saw a glass. He said, ^
""There is no heretic here."" ""Ah,"" she
said, ""you look in the glass, and you
will see the heretic!"" As I take up the
mirror of God's word today would that
instead of seeing the prodigal son of t'>e

f text we might see ourselves?our want,
our wandering, our sin, our lost condition?so
that we might be as wise as
this young man was, and say. vkI will
arise and go to my lather.""

f Seme man comes and says to me: j
'Why do you talk u bout the ruined slate i
t of the human soul? why don't you speak
about the progress of the Nineteenth

It is for this reason: A
man never wants the jrospel until he
realizes he is in a famine struck state.
Suppose I should c ;me to you m vour

amounts to nothing. You must have a
stout, tremendous resolution like this
youuir man of the text when he said, ""I
will arise and so to my father.""
THE ABOUNDING MERCYOF GOD.
""Oh!"" says some man, ""how do I
know my father wants me? How do I
know, if I go back, I would be received:'""
""Oh!"" says some man, ""you don't know !
where I have been, you don't know how !

tar I have wandered; you wouldn't iaiK j
that way to me if you knew all the iniquities
1 have committed."" What is
that flutter among the angels of God? It
is news, it is new?! Christ has found the
lost.
Nor angels can their joy contain,
But kindle with new fire:
The sinner lost, is found, they sins.

And strike the sounding jyre.
When Napoleon talked of going into
Italy, they said: '4You can't get there.
If you knew what the Alps were you
wouldn't talk about it or think of it.
You can't get your ammunition wagons
Dver the Alps."" Then Xapoleon rose
in bis stirrups and waving his hand toward
the mnuntains, he said, ""There
ho nn MnJ! "" That, wonderful nass

was laid out which has beeu the wonderment
ol all the years since?the wonderment
ot all engineers. And you tell
me there are such mountains of sin between
your soul and God, there is no
mercy. Then I see Christ waving his
liand toward the mountains. I hear him
say, ""I will come over the mountains of
thy sin and the hills of thy iniquity.""
There shall be no Pyrenees; there shall
be no Alps.
Again, I notice that this resolution of
the young man of the text was founded
:n sorrow at his misbehavior. It was
aot mere physical plight. It was grief
that he.bad so maltreated his father. It
is a sad thing after a father has done
everything for a child to have that child
be ungrateful.
How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is,
To have a thankless child.

is the heaviness of his mother."" That is
the Bible. Well my friends, haye not
some of us been cruel prodigals? Have
we not maltreated our Father? And
such a Father! So loving, so kind. If
he had been a stranger, if he had forsaken
us, it he had pounded us and
turned us out of doors on the commons,
it would not have been so wonderful?
our treatment oi him; but he is a Father

us for our wanderings have never apologized.
We apologize lor wrongs done
to our fellows, but some of us perhaps
have committed ten thousand times ten
thousand wrongs against God and never
apologized.
I remark still farther that this resolution
of the text was founded in a feeling
of homesickness. I don't know how long
this young man, how many months, how
many years he had been away from his
father's house; but there is something in
the reading ot my text that makes me
think he was homesick. Some of you
know what that feeling is. Far away
from home sometimes, surrounded by
everything bright and pleasant?plenty

of friends?you have said, l'I would give
the world to be home tonight."" Well,
this young man wa . homesick for his
father's house. 1 have no doubt when
he though, of his father's house he said,
""Xow, perhaps, father may not be living.""
WAS THE PRODIGAL'S MOTHER DEAD?
We read nothing in this story?this
parable founded on everyday life?we read
nothing about the mother. It says nothing
about going home to her. I think

she was dead. I think she had died ol
a broken heart at his wanderings. A
man never sets over having lost his
mother. Nothing said about her here.
But he is homesick for his father's house,
lie thought he would just like to go and
walk around the old place. lie thought
he would just like to 20 and see if things
were as the}- used to be. Many a man
after .having teen oil a iong while bus
gone home and knocked at the door, and
a stranger has come. If- is the old homestead,
but a stranger comes to the door,
lie finds out father is gone and mother
is cone, and brothers and sisters all gone.
I think this young man of the text said
to himself. ""Perhaps father may be
dead."" Still he starts to find out. He
is homesick. Are there any here today
homesick for God, homesick for heaven?

his mother tried to persuade him not to
sro avvav again. She said: uXow you
had better stay at home. Don't go away;
we don't want you to go. You will have
it a great deal better here."" P. at it made
him angry. The night before he went
away a^ain to oea he heard his mother
praying in the next room, and that made
him more angry. lie went lar out on
the sea aad a storm came up, and he
was ordered to very perilous duty,
and he ran up the ratlines, and
amid the shrouds of the ship he
heard the voice that he had heard
in the next room. He tried to rally

his courage, but he could not silence
that voice he had heard in the next room,
aud there in the storm and the darkness
he said: O Lord! what a wretch I have
been; what a wretch I am. Help me
just now. Lord God."" And I thought
in this assemblage today there may be
some who may have the memory of a
father's petition or a mother's prayer

A lad at Liverpool went out to bathe,
went out into the sea. went out too far,
got beyond his depth and he tloated far
away. A ship bouud for Dublin came
along and took him on board. Sailors
are generally very generous fellows, and
one gave him a cap and another gave
him a jacket, and another gave him
shoes. A gentleman passing along on

me beach at .Liverpool ioima me iacrs
cloihes and took them home, and the
father was heartbroken, the mother was
heart-broken at the loss of their child.
They had heard nothing iicm him day
after day. and they ordered tiie usual
mourning lor the sad event. Dut the
lad took ship from Dublin and arrived in
Liverpool the very day the garments

to nothing because sv*e make them for

There is a man who hud the typhoid
fever. He said: ""Oh! if I could get
over this terrible distress! If this fever
should depart, if I could be restored to
health, I would all the rest of my life
serve God."" The fever departed. He
got well enough to walk around the
block. He go* well enough to go over
o New York and attend to business,
lie is well to-day?as well as he ever
was. Where is the broken vow ? There
is a man who said long ago, ""If I could
live to the year 1891, by that time I
will have my business matters arranged,
and I will have time to attend to religion,
and I will be a good, thorough,
consecrated Christian.""
Th? vear 1891 has come. January,

February. March, April, May, June?almost
half of the year gone. Where is
your broken vow V ""Oh,"" says some
man: ""I'll attend to that when I can
get my character lixed up. When i
can get over my evil habits. I am now
given to strong drink,"" or, says the
man, ""I am given to uncleaaness,"" or,
says the man, ""I am given to dishonesty.""
When I get over my present habits,
then I'll be a thorough Christian."" My
brother, you will get worse and worse,
until Christ takes you in hand. ""Not
the righteous; sinners, Jesus came to

Oh! but you say,**i agree with vou 011
all that, but I ""must put it off : little

longer."" Do you know there were
many who came just as near as you are
to the kingdom of God and never entered
it? I was at East Hampton and
L went into the cemetery to look
around, and in that cemetery there are
twelve graves side by side?the graves
of sailors. This crew, some years ago,
in a ship went into the breakers at
Amagansett, about three miles awav.
My brother, then preaching ?.t Last
Hampton, ii&d Icen at the burial.
These men of the crew came very near

uemg savea.
The people from Amaganset? saw the
vessel, and they shot rockets, and they
sent ropes from the shore, and these
poor fellows got into the boat, and they
pulled mightily for the shore, but just
before they got to the shore the rope
snapped and the boat capsized and they
were lost, their bodies afterward washed
up on the b3ach. Oh, what a solemn

day it was?I have been told or it oy
my brother?wheQ these twelve men
lay at the foot of the pulpit and he read
over them the funeral service! They
came very near shore?within shouting
distance of the shore?yet did not
arrive on solid land. There are some
men who come almost to the shore of
God's mercy, but not quite, not quite.
To be only almost saved is not to be
saved at all.
I will tell you of two prodigals, the
onu that got bick and the other that
did not get back. In Virginia there is
a very prosperous and beautiful home
in many respects. A young man wandered
off from that home. He wandered
very far into sin. They heard of
him often, but he was always on the
wrong track. lie would not go home.
At the door of that beautiful home one

night there was a great outcry. The
young man of the house ran down and
opened the door to see what was the
matter. It was midnight. The rest of
the family were asleep. There were
the wife and tne children of this prodigal
young man. The tact was he had
come home and driven them out. lie
said: ""Out of this house. Away with
these children; I will dash their brains
oat. Out into the storm!""
The mother gathered them up and
lied. The next morning the brother,
the younjj man who had stayed at home,
went out to hnd this prodigal brother
anri ?r?n nnrl hp came where he was.

and saw the young man wandering up
and down in front of the place where
he had been staying, and the young
man who had kept his integrity said to
the older brother: ""Here, what does
all this mean? What is the matter
with you? Why do you act in this
way?"" The prodigal ""looked at, him
and said: ""Who am I? Who do you
take me to be?"" lie said, ""You are my
brother."" ""Xo, I am not, I am a brute.
Have you seen anything of my wife
and children ? Are they dead ? I drove
them out last night in the storm. I
am a brute. John, do you think there
is any help for me? *Do you think I
will ever get over this life of dissipaÂ­

uon r' lie saiu, ""iiromer, tnere is jusu
one thing that will stop this."" The
prodigal ran his finger across his
throat ana said: ""That will stop it.
and I'll stop it before night. Oh! my
brain; I can stand it no longer."" That
prodigal never got home. 15at 1 will
tell you of a prodigal that did get
home.
TWO RAN AWAY, BUT ONE RETURNED.
In England two young men started
from their father's house and went
down to Portsmouth. The father
could not pursue his children; for some
reason lie could not leave home, and so
he wrote a letter down to Mr. Gritlin,
saying: ''Mr. Griffin, I wish you would
go and see my two sons. They have arrived
in Portsmouth, and they are

going to taKe snip auu going away
from""home. 1 wish you would persuade
them back."" Mr. Grillin went and he
tried to persuade them back. lie persuaded
one to go. He went with very
easy persuasion because he was very
homesick already. The other young
man said: ""I will not go. I have had
enough of home. I'll never go home.""
'Well,"" said Mr. Grillin, ""then if you
won't go home I'll a get you respectab'e
position on a respectable ship."" '*Xo
you won't."" said the prodigal. ""No

you won't. 1 am going as a common
sailor: that will plague my father most,
and what will do most to tantalize and
worry him will please me best.""
Years passed on, and Mr. Griflin was
seated in his study one day when a message
eatne to him that there was a
young man in irons on a ship at the
dock?a young man condemned to
death?who wished to see this clergyman.
Mr. Crriilin went down to the!
dock and went on shipboard. The I
young man said to him, ""You don't!
know me, do you?"" '\Xo,"" he said: ""1 j

don't know you."" ""Why, don't you re-j
member that young man you tried to ;
persuade to go horn-', and he wouldn't}
go V"" ""Oh, ye?,"" said Mr. Griflin. ""Are j
you that man?"" "" Yes, 1 am that man.""
said the other. ""I would like to have
you pray for me. I have committed
murder, and 1 must die, but 1 don't
wan't to go out of thfc world until some
one prays for me. l%u are my father's
friend, and I would Tike to ""have you

Mr. Griffin went from judicial authority
to judicial authority to get the
young man's pardon, ile slept not
nisrht nor day. lie went from inlluenÂ­
tial person to intluential person until
sonic way he got the young man's pardon.

The New York","unknown"
"543","938386","the Deceased.
,Vashington, Nov. 21.-Vice President
Hobart's funeral on Saturday will be
attended by the members of the cabÂ­
inet, the supreme court, the senate in
a body and a large committee from
the house of representatives, besides
many dignitaries of the capital who will
jcurney to Paterson to pay their last
tribute of respect to the memory of
the vice president. Every senator has
been invited to be present and the senÂ­
ate will meet at the Fifth Avenue hoÂ­
tel, in New York, Saturday, at 1L
o'clock, thence travel in a body to PatÂ­
erson.
Sergeant at Arms Bright has engagÂ­
ed a special train to convey the presiÂ­
dent and his cabinet and the, justices
of the supreme court. The train will
leave over the Pennsylvania. railroad
at 7 a. m. Saturnday morning and will
return at 11 p. in. Chief Justice Fuller
was not in the city today and in his
absence no one could say whether the
court would be able to attend the fu
reral in a body, but the officials of
that tribunal generally expressed
themselves as very confident that it
would do so.
Owing to the face that the. house of
representatives is without a speaker
nothing regarding the house commitÂ­
it e is decided. Gen. Henderson, who
',ill be the next speaker, telegraphed
to Maj. McDowell, the clerk of the
house, at his home at Sharon, Pa., and
i\""aj. McDowell is expected here toÂ­
night. Upon his arrival he will conil
sult Gen. Henderson and other repre
'sntatives who are in the city and a
committee will be appointed to attend
the funeral.
The death of Vice-President Hobart
naturally recalls the death of \i( eÂ­
President Hendricks, who expired sudÂ­
denly of paralysis of the heart Nov. 25.
1885. At the time the ctuestion of lhe
succession of the vice-presidency had
not been settled by law. although SenÂ­
ator Hoar's 'bill providing the presiÂ­
dential succession through the cabinet
had teen submitted on Dec. 4, 1SS3, and
had' remained unacted upon.
The news of Mr. H-Iendrick's death
was r""ecivetd in Washing ton late in the
afternoon of Nov. 25. President
'leveland was at dinner when ither
nexws w'as b)rought to him by Sec('retary'
I:l:mont. Notiees were sent at once.. to
all the members of the cabinet and a
special cabinet meeting was held that
night. President C(leveland's first ant
was to dispatch a telegram of condoÂ­
lence to Mrs. Hendricks, after which :a
proclanmation was prepared making an
official announcement of the vice-presÂ­
iderit's death to the public and estabÂ­
lishing a usage which was follow\\ed toÂ­
day by President McIKinley.
On the morning following MIr. -lendÂ­
rickl.'s death meetings of such members
of the house and senate as w\\erei in
town were held at the canitol and the
committees from both legislative bodi-cs
were appointed to attend the funeral
services, which were held in IndianapÂ­
olis on the Tuesday following. NineÂ­
teen members were appointed on the
house committee and the rather unÂ­
usual number of 13 from the senate.
President ('leveland at first expressed
his intention to attend the funeral, but
there was an immediate protest from
his advisers, seconded by the press of
both parties, against his subjecting
himself t.o even the slightest possibility
of an accident incident to travel at a
time when there was no provision for
a successor in oflice and when his death
might have entailed serious conseÂ­
,luences.
After some days President Cleveland
deferred to the advice of his friends
and remained in Washington. T'he cabÂ­
inet. however, attended the funeral in
a body and the supreme court adtljournÂ­
ed over till after the services. PendlÂ­
ing the presicidnt's decision not to go
to Indianapolis the most elabmiorat
i)reparations were made bly the railroad
officials for the safeguarding of ihs
train in case the journey should be
made, special track walkers, pilot enÂ­
gines and th.e like being detailed to inÂ­
suire the safety of the whole route. The
vice-pr'esideint xas in Indianapolis at
the time of his death, andi through :a
singular net of cireumstan ces no
ione
was in the iroiom with him when he iexÂ­
pired.
The law applicable to the vice-presiÂ­
dency was enacteid Jan. 3S.li :lSS, by the
Forty-ninth congress' first session. The
main features are as followxs: ""eI it
enacted, etc., that in case of removal,
death, resignation or inability of both
the nlsl'iin iÂ­
n nd vir,, - irgelant oi i h


UTnited' States the secretary of state or
:: * : or secretary of the treasurye, ,r
* secretary of war, or * .*
attolrney general, or : * * secretary
of the navy, or * * * secretary of
the interior shall act as president until
the disability of the president or viceÂ­
president is removed or until a presiÂ­
dent shall be elected.""
The law further plroxvidcs that when one
of the above cabinet officers succeeds to
the presidency he shall call a special sesÂ­
sion of congre'ss A.
A proviso limits the
succession to those who would be eligible
to the presidency under the terms of the
constitution and who have been appointed
withtilTe advice and consent of the senate.
The effect of the law is not to provide a
successiil to the vice presidency, but
merely to ensure a succession to the presÂ­
idency.
Byx the death of Mr. Hobart, Senator
William P. 1Frye of Maine becomes plresiÂ­
dent pro tem. and will discharge all the
duties of the. vice president as presiding
officer of the senate. The senate rules
sieefically provide that no election is necÂ­
essary at the beginning of the session.
Senator Frye accordingly will continuel
as presidin.g officer until the end of PresiÂ­
di.nt MlcAinley's ad:ninistration, unless he
chooses to resigi or the"" senlate wishes
to elect another senaltol' to the office.
A. curious coincident of the death of the
vice president is found in the fact that of
the six vice presidents who have died n
office four ded within a few days of the
same day of the same month in the year,
thie death of Mr. Hobart being the 21st of
November, 18t'9. that of Mr. Wilson the
22nd of November, .185, that of I1,lbridge
Gerry, Nov. 23, 18i.l, that of Mir. Hendricks
Nov. 25, 1885. The Olhelr two vice presi,
dtents who died in office were C'liniton and
King. The former died April 20, 1812, antd
the latter Atrl 17, 1151.

Washington, Nov. 21.-All flags in
Washington are half masted out of reÂ­
spect to the memory of Vice-President
Iobart. The announcement of his death
le:.ct a gloom over the city where he w'as




 loved and honored. The president was
deeply affected by the telegram anÂ­
nouncing his colleague's death and at
once dispatched a telegram conveying
sympathy and condolence of himself
and Mrs. McKinley to Mrs. Hobart.
Secretary of State Hay heard the
news upon his arrival at the state deÂ­
partment and, immediately repaired to
the white house. Meantime Senator
Fairbanks of Indiana and Senator FosÂ­
ter of Washington had joined the presÂ­
ident and were with him when SecreÂ­
tary Hay arrived. The secretary reÂ­
mained with the president about ten
minutes. He was visibly affected whexn
he left the white house. He said the
president and cabinet would attend the
funeral. After Senator Fairbanks left
the president retired to his private
apartments. His close intimate relaÂ­
tions with his colleague made him feel
the vice-president's death as a personal
bereavement. Mrs. McKinley was
greatly affected and gave way comnÂ­

Sleep Irs Importance. There is no fact
more clearly established in the physiology of
man than this:, that the brain expends its
energies and itself during the hours of wakeÂ­
fullness, and that these are recuperated durÂ­
ing the hours of sleep ; if the recuperation
does not equal the expenditure, the brain

Thus it is that, in English history, persons
who were condemned to death, by being preÂ­
vented from sleeping always died raving
maniacs. Thus it is that those who are starvÂ­
ed to death first become insane. Tbe brain
is not nourished, and they cannot sleep.

Craiy persons are poor sleepers, while good

leenera seldom become craxy. I he practi-,
cal inference! are these :
1st. Those who think most, who do most
brain work, repoire most sleep.
2d. That time saved from necessary sleep
Is infallibly destructive to mind,body,and es
tate.
3d. Give yourself, your children.your ter-
vants give all that ar under you- the full
est amount of sleep they will take, by comÂ­
pelling them to go to bi at some tegular
early hour and to rise in the morning at a
stated hour, and within a fortnight nature,
with almost the regularity of the rising sun,
will unloose the bonds ot sleep the moment
enough repose has been secured for the wants

tamned with her, there can be no iloceesity for tile ContiÂ­
nuance of the mnission to Frantkfort. I have therefore reÂ­
called Mr. Dotteison, and directed sthe archives of the legsÂ­
otiom at Frankfort to be trasnferred to the Ainericsn legation
at Berlin. I
leavig liven apprised that a considerable numuber of adÂ­
venturers'were engaged in fitting ottt a usilitaty expedition,
'Withits thicUnited States, egaiot it aforeign country ;and
believing, from the best informtation I could obtain, that it
,wos destined to isivaile tlse ishanid of Cuba, I deemted it due I
tothie friendly relistions existitig betwveen the United States
and Spain a to the, treaty betweien the two Ilatiois ; to the
lawvs of the~ United State.s, and, above all, to the Aiuericau
bonour, to exert the lawful authority of this Goversmtent in
suppressing the expedition ant prleventinlg the invasion. Tol
this end I issued a proclamation, enjoining it upon the of8-.
cers of the United States, civil and military, to use all lawÂ­
ful means within their powers. A copy of that proclamationm
is herewith slibmitted. Tito expedition has been suppressed.
So long as the aist of Congress of the 20th of April, 1818,
whieh owes its existence to the Ilw of nations and to the
policy of Washington himself, shall remain on our statute
book, I hold it to be the duty of the Executive faithfully to
obev its injunctions.
While this expedition was us progress, I was informed
that a foreigner, who claiiked our protevtion, had been
clammdestimselv, and, as was supposed, forcibly carried off in a
vessel from New Orlesslis to the islansd of Cuba. I imme.
diately catsed such steps to be taken as I thought neces.
sary, in ease tie information I had received should prove
correct, to vindicate the hottour of the country, and the
right of every, peoson seeking ass syltis OtI our soil to the
protection of ourlaws. Tile person alleged to have been
abducted wos promptly restored, and the circvmmstances of
tise case are no w about to isidoergo illvestigation before a
audicial tribunal. T would respectfully suggest, that although
the cruine ehlsauged to have beems commuitted in tlsis case is
held obvious as being io conflict antIs our opinions oil this
subject of natiussal sdvererigntt ated] personal freedom thlere
is so prohibition of if, or p""'eiehsmeiit for it provides in any

in our criminal code, is, therefore, recommended to your
consideration.
I have icrupulously avoided ansy interference in the wars
and contentions which have recent4y distracted Europe.
During the late confliet between Austria and 7lunga5ry,
there Seeed to be a prospect that the latter might become
an independent nation. However faint that prospect at the
tme appeared, I tto~hmt it my duty, in accordance with the
general aentimnemit of the .American people, who deeply symÂ­




 pilthized with the agyar patriots, to stand prepared, upon
the contingency of th establishument by hle, of a perm-Ianent nsi
gvrm tto be tile first to welcomle ineenet ugr3 i

aggent, then ini Europe, N)ith power to declare our willingness etr
fytrecoguise her independence, in the event of herÂ­ t ra
bilrity to sustalis it. The powerful interventionA of RUSa OR,
inl the contest exthincuished the hlopes of the struggflng ell
Magyars. The U~iiite~d States did not, at anyv tune, interfere co,
inl tlse conltest ; 1.11t thle feelings of the na tion were strongly Pa!

t tswee the department of State anld the Minister and Consul a
a of time United States at Rio do Janeiro, which has from time ft

D United States for a newv re~gister, proceed at once to the a

has recently been transmitted to this department of State.

esof Nicaragua to enter into the same treaty stipulations with
le i
her; cand the benefit to be derived by each from such au
b
arramgement will be the protection of this great inter-oceanic
r communication against any power which might seek to obÂ­
liÂ­ struct it, or to monopolise its advantages. All states entering
wÂ­ into such a treaty will enjoy the right of passage through the
Dd canal, on payment of the same tolls.
18,
The work, if constructed under these guarantees, will beÂ­
he cdmo a bond of Peace, instead of a subject of contention and
Itc strile, betweeu tlte nations of the earth. Should the great
to nmaritime states of Europe consent to this arrangement-and
we haire no reason to suppose that a proposition so fair and
led hoiomirable will be opposed by any-the energies of their
penpeople and ours will co-operate in promoting the success of
n a
the enterprise. I do not recommend any appropriation from
ne -
the natiottal treasury for this purpose, nor o I believe such
es' an appropriation is necessary. Private enterprise, if proÂ­
O ave perly protected, will complete the work, should it prove to
the be feasible. The parties who have procured the charter from
the Nicaragua for its construction desire no assistance from this
e en
Government beyond its protection - and they profess that,
1 o
of having examined the proposed line of communication, they
e a a
will be ready to commence the undertaking whenever that
19h tghprotection shall be extended to them. Should there appear
e is is
to be reason, on examining the whole evidence, to entertain
the a serious doubt of the practicability of constructing such a
ecarecnal, that doubt could be speedily solved by an actual exÂ­
, any ploration, of the route.
ect Should such a work be constructed, tnder the common
our protection of all nations, for equal benefits to all, it would be
neither just nor expedient that any great maritime state
7ars should command the communication. The territory through
which the canal may be opened ought to be freed from the
t ry, claims of any forig power. No such power ahould Occupy
'me a position that would enable it hereafter to exercise so conÂ­
ttie trolling an influence over the cemmieree of the w-orld, or to
the t
obstruct highway which ought to be dedicated to the
,M.o mn
On ues of mankind.




 The routes across the Isthmnus, at Tehuiantepec and l'sÂ­ co
nainna, are -also worthy of our se1rious COnsderatioss. They
did not fail to engage thle attentiont of m ly predecessor. The tlei
siegotiatotroof the treaty of Guadalupe Hlidalgo Was snlÂ­ ott
stutdt offer a very large of mloney, for thle right ofIi
transit across the Is thmus -of~ Tehuantcpec. The MIexican Lo
Government did not accede to the proposition for thle purÂ­ pri
chase of the !-iiht of way, probably because it had already co
contracted wit 1private iudividuals for the construti~ton of a be
passage froms thc Guasacualco river to Telinantepec. I shall thr
not reneow any, propositioni to purchase, for stoney, a right als
which ought to be equally secured to till nations, on payment ex
of at reasonable toil to the owners of the improvement, who en
would, doubtless, be well contented wirth that compensation TI:
and the guarantees of the maritime states of the world, Iin Co
separate treaties negotiated with Mexico, binding her and thi
them to protect those who should construct the work. Suich be
guarantees would do more to secure thle completion of the im5
communicatioa. through the territory of Mexico than any lat
other reasonable considerationa that could be offered ; and as it
Mexico herself would be the greatest gainer by the opening Hu
of this commmuceation between the Iinf anid the Pacific by
Ocean, it is presumed that she would not hesitate to yield nit
her aid, in the manner proposed, to accomplish an iniproveÂ­ sti
asent so important to her owyn best interests.
We have reason to hope that the proposed railroad across wi
the Isthnmus at Panama will be siseceesfully constructed, unÂ­ rel
der the protection of the late treaty with N~ew Grenada, ratiÂ­
fied and exchanged by my predecessor onl the 10th day of ass
June, 1848 which guarantees the perfect neutrality of the an
Isthmus, and thle rights of sovereignty land property of New hIs
Grenada over that territory, "" with a view that the free pr
transit from ocean to ocean may not be interrupted or emÂ­ wam
barrassed"" during the existence of the treaty. It is our pu
policy to encourage every practicable route across the IsthiÂ­ ma;
moe which connects North and South America, either by ca
railroad or canal, which the energy, and enterprise of our uc
citizens may induce tisemi to complete ; and I contidier it ohÂ­ ase
ligatory upon me to adopt that policy, espeeially in conseÂ­ wI
quence of the absolute necessity of facilitating isitercourso
with our possessions oilthe Pacific. M
The position of the Sandwich Islands, with reference to the de
territory of the United States onl the Pacific ;the success of us
tour persevering and benevolent citizens who have repaired fo
do that resmote quarter in Christianizing the natives, and inÂ­ m
ticing them to adopt a systens of government and lsaws in
nuited to their capacity and wants ; and the use made by our wi
ounterous whale-ships of the harbours of the islands as places re
f resort for obtaining refreshments and repairs, all combine In
to render their destiny peculiarly iisteresting to us. It is our wi
dutty to encourage the authorities of those islands in their Sc
efforts to tisproveo and elevate the moral and political conidiÂ­
tiots of the inhabitants; and we should make reasonable ra
allowances for thediffiettities inseparable frosn this task. We ra
desire that the islandsÂ­ may maisitain their independence, ar
and that. other nations should concur with ise in this sentiÂ­ be
ment. W~e cotild lit no event be indiffereist to their passing p
under the donsinion of any other power. The principal coin -hr
mercial states have in thitl a common interest, and it is to be ot
hoped tbat no one of them will attempt to interpose obstaÂ­ to
cles to the entire independence of the islands. ml

niakirig in the whole a probable deficit, to be provided for, pr
of sixteen millions three hundred and seventy-five thousand

($16,375,214 39c.) The extraordinary expenses of thie war ds
with Mexico, and the purchase of California and New m
Mexico, exceed in amount this deficit, together wvith tite se
loans heretofore made for those objects. I therefore recoinÂ­ to.
miend that authority be given to borrow whatever suns maay An
be necessary to cover that deficit. I recommend the obserÂ­ th
vance of strict economy in the appropriation asid expenditure Ci
of public nioney. Its
Ire commend a revision of the existing tariff, and its adÂ­ qi~
jiistraent on a basis which masy augmenit the revenue.I do
not doubt the right or ditty of Congress to cilcourage domesÂ­ tit
tie industry; which is the great source of national as well as th
individual wealth and prosperity. I look to the wisdom and Is
1satrlotism of Congress for the adoption of a system which pm
racy place home labour, at last, on a sure mid pernsaneitt ct,
footiiig, and, by due encouragement of mnanufactures, give a Pi
new and increased stimulus to agriculture, and promote the Ct
development of our vast resources and the extension of ouir
commerce. Believing that to the attainment of these ends fu
(swell as the necessary augmentation of thle reveitue -and Pt
tite prevention of frauds) a system of specific duties is betre
adapted, I strongly recommend to Congress the adoption li,
of that s3'stem, fixing the duties at rates high enough to afford se
substantial and sufficient encouragement to our own indtisÂ­ fi
try, and at thle same time so adjusted as to insure stability. all
The question of the coatntinance of the sub-treasury re

For further details and views on the above and other matÂ­ di
tore connected with commerce, the fiuiances, and revenue, I i
refer to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury. tr
No direct, aid bas been given by the general Government IN1
to the hInprovemenit of agriculture except by the expenditure ti
of small suniss for the collection and publication of agriculÂ­ ot
tssral statistics, and for some clinensIca analyses, which have di
beets thus far paid for out of the patent fund. This aid is,
il my opinion, wholly inadequate. To give to thItl leading a
branch of Asterican industry the encostrsiement which it ri,
snerits, I respectfully recommend the establishment of an P
Agricultural bureau, to be connected with the department of ol
the Interior. To elevate the social condition of the agriculÂ­ T
turist, to increase his prosperity, and to extend hIls means of E
usefulness to his country by musltiplying Isis sources of iniÂ­ tI
forniation, should be the study of every statesman, anid a
Iprimary object with every legislator. 0
o
No civil Goverrnmenst having been provideul by Congress b
Ifor California, the people of that territory, impelled by the P
Inecessities of their political condition, recently met iii cuisÂ­
vention, for the purpose of forming a, Constitution asid state hi
. Governtient, which, the latest advices give me reason to c,
I suppose, has been acconiplishied, and it is believed they a:
will shortly apply for the admission of California into the tl
Union, as a sovereign state. Should stich he the case, and a
r should their constitution be conformable to the requisitions t!
s'of the constitution of the United States, I recommnend titeir fi
t application to the favourable consideration of Congress. V
y The people of New IMexico will also, it is believed, ait c
r no very distant period, present themselves for admsission v
-into the Union. Preparatory to the admission of California
I 1and New Mexico, the people of each will have instituted
eefor themselves a republican ferns of Goverunsent, "" laying f
aaits foundations in susch principles, and organizing its powersi
yin such form, as to tlsen shall seem most likely to effectc
dtheir safety and happiness.""
e By assaiting their action, all causes of uneasiness may be
eeavoided, and confidence and kind freelimg preserved. With
if a view of maintaining the harmony and tranquillity so dear I
r, to all, we should abstain from hiss introduction of thoset
s. exciting topics of a sectional character which have hitherto I
A tproduced palitful apprehensions in the puiblic mind; and I
iIs repeat thte solemn warning of the first and niost illustrious
A fof my predecessors against furnishing ""1any ground for elmsÂ­ I
~r racterizing parties by geographical discriminations.""
s, A. collector has been appointed at, San Francoisco, under I
aÂ­
the act of Congress extending the revenue laws over CallÂ­ i
so
fornia ; and measures have been takcen to organize thle cueÂ­ I
so
toni-house at that and the otlier ports mentioned in that 1
tMlast, at thee earliest period practicable. The collector proÂ­
mmceeded overland, and advices have not yet been received of
iis his arrival at San Francisco. Meanwhile, it is utaderstood
se that the customs have continued to be collected there by
IiÂ­ officers acting under the military authority, as they were
during the administration of my predecessor. It will,
7eÂ­ I think, be expediemit to confirm the collections thus made,
4y aod direct the avails (afte rsuch allowances as Congress may
teÂ­ think fit to authorize) to be expended within the territory,
)o, or to be paid into the Treasury, for the purpose of meeting
appropriations for the improveisent of its rivers and barÂ­
1rÂ­ hours.
Ito A party, engaged on the coast survey, was despatelsed to
Oregon in January last. According to the latest advices,
of they had not left California; and directiotis have been given
ve to them, as soon as they shiall have fixed oii the sites ofthe
ngtwo light-houses and the buoys authorized to be constructed
9and placed in Oregon, to proceed without delay to make reÂ­
nd conisoissances of the most important points on the coast of
Ltt .California. atid especially to exaumitie and determine onl sites
t
for light-h'ouses on that coast, the speedy erection ot whicn
is urgently demanded by our rapidly increasing commerce.
au I have transferred thie Indian agencies from Upper MisÂ­
liC souri and Council Bluffs to Santa Fe and Salt Lake, and have
ibÂ­ caused to be appointed sub-agents in the valleys of the Gila,
the Sacramento, and San Joaquin rivern. Still further legal
tg provisions will be necessary for the effective and stcceesfal
le extension of our system of Indian intercourse over the new
territories.
b eÂ­ I recommend the establishment of a branch mint in
ndCalifornia, as it will, in my opinion, afford important faciliÂ­
eat ties to those engaged in mining, as well as to the GoveriÂ­
nd ment in the disposition of the mineral lands.
snd I also recommend that commissions be orapnized by
.eir Congress, to examine and decide upon the validity of the
of resent subsisting land titles in California and New
oM Mexico; and that Rrovision be made for the establishment
ich
of offices of surve or-general in New Mexico, California, and
roÂ­ Oregon, and for the surveying and bringing into market the
t
to public lands in those territories. Those lands, remote in poÂ­
o m sition and difficult of access, ought to be disposed of on
his terms liberal to all, but especially favourable to the early
lat, emigraits.
oey In order that the situation and character of the principal
list mineral deposits in California may be ascertained, I recomÂ­
ear mend that a geological and mineralogical exploration be conÂ­
ain neoted with the linear surveys, and that the mineral lauds
Is
a be divided into small lots suitable for mining, and be disÂ­
e eÂ­ posed of by sale, or lease, so as to give our citizens an opÂ­
portunity of procuring a permanent right of property sn
son the soil. This would seem to be as important to the sueÂ­
b
be cess of mining as of agricultural pursuits.
ate The great m;ineral wealth of California and the advantages
ih which its ports and harbours, and those of Oregon, afford to
the
commerce, especially with the islands of the Pacific and
spy Indian oceatis, and the populous regions of Eastern Asia,
onÂ­ make it certain that there will arise, ins a few years, large
rtoand prosperous communities on our western coast. it,
the therefore, becomes important that a line of communications
the best and most expeditious which the nature of the




 ~oulntry will admit, should be opened, within the territory be
of tile United States, front thle navigable waters ot ins
the Atlantic or thle Gulf of Mexicu to the PaÂ­ rat
cific.. Opinion as elicited and ex pressed by two sat
large and respectable conventions, lately assembled at St. of
Louis and Momishis, points to a railroad' as that which, if an
practicable, will best moot the w~ishies and wants of the
country. But while this, if in successful operation, would
be a work of great national importance, and of a value to
the country which it would be difficult to estimate, it ought Iu
also to be regarded as an undertaking of vast magnitude and
expense, and one whisih must, if it be, indeed, practicable,
encounter many. difficulties inl its constructiolt and use.
Therofore, to avoid failure and disappointment ; to enable
Congress to judge Nwhether, in the condition of the country
through which it must pass, thle work be feasible, and if it TI
be found so, whether it should be undertaken as P. national
imaprovement or left to individual enterprise ; and in the Rl
latter alternative, what aid, if any, ought to be extended to
it by thle Government, I recommend as a preliminary nieaÂ­
sure a careful reconitoissance of the several proposed routes
bv a scientific corps, and a report as to fthe practicability of
niaking such a road, with anl estimate of the cost of its conÂ­
struction and support.
For further views onl these and other matters connected
with the duties of thle Home Department, I refer you to the A,
report of the Secretary of the Interior.
Irecommend early appropriations fo;r contininig the river
and harbour impirovements which have been already begun, TI
and also for tleÂ­ construction of those for which estimates
have been made, as welt as for examinations and estimates Ti
preparatory to the commencemencft of suck others as the
wants of the counitry, and especially the advance of our poÂ­
pulation over new districts, and the extension of commerce, Li
mayrede necessary. An estimate of the amount which
can be.U advnaeus epne within the next fiscal year, TI
under the direction of the Bureau of Topographical EngiÂ­
neers, accompanies the report of the Secretary of War, to R
which I respectfully invite the attention of Congress.
The cession of territory made by thle late treaty with R
Mexico has greatly extended our exposed frontier, and ren.
dered its defence more difficult. That treaty has also brought
usunderobligations toMexico, to complywith. whidlia military
force is requisite. But our military establislsment is niot R
materially changed, as to its efficienoy., frois the condition
in which it stood before thle commencesnent of the Mexican
war. Some addition to it will therefore be necessary ; and I
recommend to the favourable consideration of Congress an R
increase of the several corps of the army at our distant
western ports as proposed in the accompanying report of the It
Secretary of WVar.
Great embarrassment has resulted from the effect upon
rank in the army heretofore given to brevet and staff consÂ­
missions. The views of thieSecretary of War on this subject
are deemed important, and, if carried into effect, will, it is A
believed promote the harmony of the service. The plan
prsposem for retiring disabled officers, and providing an asyÂ­
lum for such of the rank and file as from age, wounds, and
other infirmities occasioned by service, have become unfit
to perform their respective duties, iv recommended as a T
means of increasing thle efficiency of the atrmy, and as an
act of justice, due from a grateful country to the faithfulT
soldier.T
The accompanying report of the Secretary of the Navy
presentsr a full and satisfactory -account of the condition and
operations of the naval service during the past year. Our
citizens engaged in the legitimate pursuits of commerce haveC
enjoyed its benefits. Wherever our iiational vessels, have
gule, heyhav ben received with respect, ouor officers haveE
been treated with kindness and courtesy, and they have, on
all occasions, pursued a course of strict neutrality, in acÂ­ E
cordance with the policy of our Goversnment.
Time naval force at presRent in commission is as large as is A
admissible, with the number of men authorized by Congress F
to be employed.
I invite yonr attention to thle recommendation of the Sec. II
rotary of thle Navy' ois the subject of a reorganization of the It
navy, in its various grades of officers, and the establishing P
of a, retired list for suchl of thle officers asÂ­ are disqualified for N
active and effective service. Should Congress aslopt some Ii
suchl measure as is recommended, it will greal increase tise
efficiency of the navy, and reduce its expendtitres.
I also ask your attention to the views expe e yhim
in reference to the employment of war-steames an nreÂ­
gard to the coistraictS for the transportatioiio the Uited T
States mails, and the operation of the sy stem upon the
prosperity of the iiavy.I
By an act of Coangress passed August 14, 1848, proviÂ­ R
sion was made for extending post-office and mail accommnoÂ­
doations to California and Oregon. Exertions have been
made to execute that law; hut the limited provisions of the
act, the inadequacy of the meass it authorizes, the ill adapÂ­
tation of our post-office laws to tise situation of that country, T
and time measure of compensaltion) for services allowed by
those laws, compared with the price-, of labour and rents in
California, render those exertions in a great degree ineffecÂ­ T
woal. More particular and efficient provision by law is reÂ­
qiiired on this subject. P
Tue act of 1845, reducing postage, has now, by its operaÂ­ S]
tion during four years, produced results fully showeing that
the income from such reduced postage is sufficient to susÂ­
tain thle whole expense of the service of the Post-office deÂ­
partment, not inc lurling tl~e cost of transportation in mail C
steamers on the lines fromn New York to Chagres and frons
Panama to Astoria, which have not beens considered by p,
Congress as properly b~elonging to the snail service. E
It is submitted to the wisdom of Congress, whether a A
further reduction of postage should not now be sarde, more F
particularly on the letter correspondeusce. This should be I,
relieved from the unjust burtihem of transporting and deÂ­ It
liveriiug the fransked matter of Congress, forviwhich public P
service provision shsould be insoe frons time treasury. 1i conÂ­ N
fidently believe that. a change may safely be made, reducing II
all single-letter postage to the uniform rate of five cents, P
regardless of distance, without thereby imuposinug any
greater tax on time treasury than would coustitilte a
very moderate conspeissation for this public service;
and I therefore respectfully recommend such a reÂ­
duction. Should Congress prefer to abolish the franking
privilege entirely, it seems probable that no demand ons the
trauywould reslt fromt the proposed reduiction of postage.
Whettler an urther dinsinution sheuld isow be made, orI
the result of the reduction to five enl-ts, whgitch I have re.Â­
commended, should be first tested, is submitted to your
decision. s
Since the coinmencenment of the last session of Congress, ti
a1 postal treaty wvith Great Britain has beeis recived amid d
ratifiod, and such regulatiosis have been formed by time
Post-office departments of time two countries, is, pursusilce g
of that treaty, as, to carry its provisionss hate full operatioms. It
Tise attempt to extend this same arrangement through p
England to France, has not been equally successfssl ; bitt
theg purpsose has not been abandoned,a
For a particular statement of tile consdition of the PostÂ­
office department, aiid other matters conisected with that a
bramach of the public service, I refer you to the report of the d
Postmaster-General.
By the act of tise 3d of March, 1849, a board was coustiÂ­ g
tuted to make arrangeienits forÂ­ taking the seveinths census,

4 comnieree, manufactures, educatiois, and other topics, as v
would exhibit a. full view of thec pursuits, industry, educaÂ­ s,
I tioii, and resources of' the couniery."" The duties enjoined a

,, formed, it now rests with Congress to enact a law for carry-t
I ing into effect the harovision of the constitutioss which reÂ­
t quires an actual enunseration of thse people of the United t
States within the ensuing year.
I Among the duties assigised by the coisstitutiois to thme Ge-v
I mieral Government is one of local and limited applicatiois,I
r but ulot, on thsat account, the le ss uhligatory. 1 allude to
a the trust committed to Congress, as thme exclusive legis-I
aDlater and sole guardian of the interests of tise district of
IIColumbia. I beg to commend these interests to your kind I
sattention. As thte national metropolis, the city of WashingÂ­
'.tor, nsust be ail object of general interest ; amtd, founded ais
it was under the auspices of him whose immortal nmane it
rrbears, its claims to tise fostering care of Congress present
i-themselves with additional strength. Whatever can, contriÂ­
bte to its prosperity must enlist trile feig f t si
*t tuteiosal guardians, and command their favourable, consideraÂ­

if Our Government is one of limited powers, and its successÂ­
dl ful admiisistration eminently depends on the ooufinensent of
yYeach of its co-ordinate branches wvitliin its own appropriate

o)f dinary cases-as where it may becoime isecessary to defend
es the Executive against the eiscroachmesits of the legislative
:h power, or to prevent hasty and lisconsiderate or uuconstitnÂ­
tional legislation. By cautiously confining this remedy
s-withuiis the sphere prescribed to it in' the cotemporaneons exÂ­
ee positions of the framers of the constitution, the will of the
,
people, legitimately expressed on all subjects of legislation,
aR t eir constititional organs, the senators and repre.
al entatives of the United States, will have its full efect,
iw As indispensable to the preservation of our system
of self-government, the indepeudeice of the reireÂ­
in sentatives of the states and the people is guarantee by
l iÂ­
the constitution ; and they owe no responsibility to any
nÂ­ human power but their constituents. By holding the repreÂ­
sentative responsible only to the people, and-exempting him
by from all other influences, we elevate the character of the
b le constituent, and quicken his sense of responsibility to his
uw country. It is under these circumstances only that the
ntelector can feel that, in the choice of the law-maker, he is
rid himself, truly, a component part of the sovereign power of
he the nation. With equal care we should study to defehd the
10 n
rights of the executive and judicial departments, Our GoÂ­
on vernment can onily be preserved in its purity by the suppresÂ­
i y
sion and entire elimination of every claim or tendency of
one co-ordinate branch to eitcroachmemst upon another.
)aI With the strict observance of this rule and the other injuncÂ­
i .
tions of the constitution-with. a sedulous inculcation of
n-that respect and love for the Union of the States which our
dsAfaters cherished and enjoined upon their children, and with
is i
the aid of that over-ruling Providence, which has so lung
and so kindly guarded our liberties and institutions, we may
in reasonably expect to transmit them with their innumerable
m iÂ­ blessings to the remotest posterity.
But attachment to the Union of the States should be ha.
; bebitually fostered in every American heart. For more than
to half a century1 during which kingdoms and empires have
dfndfallen, this Union has stood unshaken. The patriots who
i i, formed it have long since descended to the grave; yet still it
remains, the propdest-monument to their memory, and the
object of affection and admiration with every one worthy to
n ,
bear the American name. In my judgment, its dissolution
he~h would be the greatest of calamities, arid to avert that should,




 be the study of every American. Upon it ""preservation
must depend our own happiness and that of countless geneÂ­ qu

I was conducted to the presence of Mrs Thomas, who, in the absence of her'husband, who is a miner, gave me the following interesting details for publication :' My husband and I have lived in Heathcote (Victoria) and the immediate vicinty for 41 years, 3.6 of which have been spent on thisspot.

About nine years ago my troubles were added to by enlargement of the liver, and this in itself more than sufficient to kill most people of my age, was aggravated by inflamation of the kidneys.. As you may imagine I was in a very- critical condition for a long time, and when just about to pull together again another severe attack of rheumatism brought me down. This brings me to, about five years back, when I caught influenza for the first time. But to. shorten my story, I had further attacks of rheumatism and influenza again the following year,. and though the influenza missed me for the next two years rheumatism did not. '-Life under these conditions, must have been almost intolerable ` '- It was. But I had more to face yet, for. about a year and nine mouths l was laid up with a third attack of influenza. I neverseemed to be able to'throw this off- as I had~ the others, and it made me feel terribly low-spirited.

Napoleon, according to O'Meara, ir his ' Voice from St. Helena,' replied thus : â€” ' In the course of a few years Russia will have Constantinople, the greatest part of Turkey, and all Greece. This I bold to be as certain as if it had already taken place. Almost all the cajoling and nattering which Alexander practised towards me was to gain my consent to effect this object. I would not consent, seeing that the equilibrium of Europe would be destroyed. In the natural course of things, in a few years, Turkey must fall to Russia. The greatest part of her population are Greeks, who you may say are Russians. The Powers it would injure, and who would oppose it, are England, France, Prussia, and Austria It would be very easy for Russia to engage Austria's assistance by giving her Servia and other provinces bordering upon the Austrian dominions which extend towards Constantinople. The only hypothesis that France and England may ever be allied with sincerity will be in order to prevent this. But even this alliance will not avail. France, England, ind Prussia united cannot prevent it. Once mistress of Constantinople, Russia gets all the commerce of the Mediterranean, becomes a great naval Power, and God knows what may happen. ?She quarrels with you (England), marches off to India an army of '70,000 good soldiers, which to Russia is nothing, and a hundred thousand canaille, Cossacks, and others, and England loses India. Above all the other Powers, Russia is the most to be feared, especially bv you. Her soldiers are braver than the Austrians, and she has means of raising as many as she pleases In bravery the French and English soldiers are the only ones to be compared to them. All this I foresaw. I see into futurity further than any other, and I wanted to establish a barrier against these barbarians by re-establishing the kingdom of Poland, and putting Poniatowski at the head of it as king; hut your imbeciles of. Ministers would not consent. A hundred years hence I shall bs praised, and Europe, especially England, will lament that I did not succeed.

It is surmised that Lord Salisbury re- 1, ferred to the French claims on the ,j Niger and in Yanuan (China). f, Coincidentally with the weighty utterance of the Prime Minister at the ban. n kers' dinner, Mr. Chamberlain, as re- f presenting the Liberal-Unionist section of the Cabinet, delivered a speech last ii night at Birmingham which was of even greater significance, inasmuch as, not being shackled by Lord Salisbury's responsibilities as Foreign Minister, he was at liberty to speak with greater freedom. The Secretaryof State forthe Colonies a remarked that Great Btitain, whilst t following her present policy of strict isolation, was liable to be confronted at any moment by a combination of Great Powers. Already, he said, Great Britain had done much towards consolidating the a Anglo.Saxon race. She had drawn all parts together, by infusing into the people a spirit oft Imperial patriotism, and also asense of the common interest that existed between them in regard both to trade and defence. Whets war was near, that feeling of racial unity would he even more strongly felt. Their next duty, he urged, should be to arrange for maintaining a bond of permanent amity with their kinsmen across the Atlantic. 'Their interests,"" he declared, "" are identical with ours, and a more delinite arrangement between the two countries would be better for both and better for the world as a whole."" Mr Chamberlain proceeded to allude to remarks that have been made on the Continent, and especially in France, to the effect that an alliance between Great Britain and America would form provocation for a European attack on Great Britain. He disregarded the threat. "" War,"" he said, ""would be cheaply purchased if it resulted in the Stars and Stripes and the Union Jack waving together over an Angt i.Saxon alliance."" Then, turning to another point, he stated that unless Great Britain, which was a naval power, became allied with a great military power, she would be unable to seriously injure Russia; and Russia, on the other hand, whose great strength waer""rincijpally military, would be unable to injure us. He next rn.tde a suggestion in reference to the practieability of an alliance with Russia. ""If Great Britain entered into an alliance with Russia,"" he asked, *"" who could guarantee that she would be loyal to the agreement, since Russia already had an alliance with lmrance "" isr Chamberlain then referred to the partition of China. So far, he said, there had been merely a preliminary skirmish in China. Much more important events were yet to happen. ""If Great Britain should con'tn'e to follow her present policy of i .tation, the fate of the Chinese Emtir- will hereafter be decided,"" he said, ""'without reference to, and even in defiance of, our interests."" "" Great Britain,"" said Mr Chamberlain, in conclusion, "" must not reject an alliance with those powers whose interests approximate to our own. ""There are now most momentous f issues before us, and the time may come-it may come before long--when t the Government, for the protection of e British interests, must appeal to the "" patriotism of the British people.""

The President's Recommendation
to Congress.
Repeal of tha Sherman Act Favored
Legislation Advised for the EsÂ­
tablishing of a Gold
Standard.
WAflHDfGToj, Aug. 9. The message
of President Cleveland to the extra sesÂ­
sion of congrets was delivered to both
houses shortly before 1 o'clock. It is
as foUows:
To the Congress Of the United States:
The existence f an alarming, an extraordiÂ­
nary, business situation, Involving the welfare
and prosperity f all our people, has conÂ­
strained me to call together in extra session
the people's representatives in congress to the
end that through a wise and patriotic exercise
of the legislative duty with which they are
solely charged, present evils may be mitigated
and dangers threatening the future may be
averted.
Our unfortunate financial plight is not the
result of untowasd events or of conditions reÂ­
lated to our national resources; nor is it traceÂ­
able to any of tha afflictions which frequently
check national growth and prosperity. With
plenteous crops, with abundant promise of reÂ­
munerative production and manufacture, with
unusual invitation to safe investment and with
satisfactory assurance to business enterprise,
suddenly financial distrust and fear have
sprung up on every side. Numerous moneyed
institutions have suspended because abundant
assets were not immediately available to meet
the demands of frightened depositors, surviving
corporations and individuals are content to
keep in hand the money they are usually anxÂ­
ious to loan, and those engaged in legitimate
business are surprised to find that the securiÂ­
ties they offer for loans, though heretofore satÂ­
factory, are no longer accepted Values supÂ­
posed to be fixed are fast becoming conjectural
and loss and failure have invaded every branch
of business.
I believe these things are principally chargeÂ­
able to congressional legislation touching the
purchase and coinage of silver by the general
government. This legislation is embodied in a
statute passed on the 14th day of July, 1800,
which was the culmination of much agitation
of the subject involved and which may be conÂ­
sidered a truce after the long struggle between
the advocates of free silver coinage and those
intending to be more cocservative.
Undoubtedly the monthly purchases by the
government of 4, 500,000 ounces of silver, forced
under that statute, were regarded by those inÂ­
terested in siiver procuction as a certain guarÂ­
anty of its increase in price The result, howÂ­
ever, has been entirely different, for immediÂ­
ately following a spasmodic and slight rise the
price of silver began to fall after the passage
of the act and has since reached the lowest
point ever known. This disappointing result
has led to renewed and persistent effort in the
direction of free silver coinage.
Meanwhile, not only are the evil effects of
the operation of the present law constantly acÂ­
cumulating, but the result to which its execuÂ­
tion must inevitably lead, is becoming palpable
to all who give the least heed to financial subÂ­
jects.This law provides that in payment for the
4580,0 ,0 ounces of silver bullion which the secÂ­
retary of the treasury is commanded to purÂ­
chase monthly there shall be issued treasury
fcotes redeemable on demand in gold or silver
coin, at the discretion of the secretary of
the treasury, nd that the said notes m:iy
be reissued It is, however, declared in the act
to be ""the established policy of the United
States to maintain the two metals upon a parity
with each other upon the present legal ratio or
such ratio as may be provided by law.""
This declaration so controls the actions
of the secretary of the treasury as to
prevent his exercising the discretion nominally
vested in him if by such action the parity beÂ­
tween gold and silver may be disturbed. Man!
feetly, a refusal by the secretary to pay these
treasury notes in gold if demanded would
necessarily rrult In their discredit and deÂ­
preciation, as obligations payable only in silÂ­
ver, and would destroy the parity between the
two metals by establishing a discrimination in
favor of gold. j
Up to the 15tjn day of July, 1893, these notes
had been issued in payment of silver bullion
purchased to the amount of more than 8147,000,Â­
ooa While all iKKt a very small quantity of
this bullion rr-m pr s uncoined and without useÂ­
fulness in the ftreasury, many of the notes
given in its purchase have been paid in gold.
This is illustrated by the statement that beÂ­
tween the 1st of May. 1S9J. and the 15th day of
July, 1893, the ntts of thiB kind issued in payÂ­
ment for silver- bullion amounted to a little
more than $i4,(00,000. and that during the same
period about'&H&GOO.ooo were paid by the treasÂ­
ury in gold for tnevredemption of such notes.
The policy necessarily adopted of paying
these notes in gold has not spared the gold reÂ­
serve of 1JO.UW,000, Ion:? ago set aside by the
government for the redemption of other notes,
for this fund has already been subjected to the
payment of new obligations amounting to about
JlfO,000,0J0 on account of silver purchases, and
has as consequence, for the first time since its
creation, been encroached upon.
We have thus made the depletion of our gold
easy and have tempted other and more appreÂ­
ciative cations to add it to their stock. That
the opportunity we have offered has not been
neglected is shown by the large amounts of
gold which have been recently drawn from
our treasury and exported to increase the
financial strength of foreign nations. The exÂ­
cess of exports of gold over its imports for
the year ended June 3.1, 1893, amounted to
more than $37,500,OOj. Between the first day
of January, 1690, and the 1-ith day of July. 1393,
the gold coin and bullion in our treasury deÂ­
creased more than $13,000,000, while during
the same period the silver coin and bullion in
the treasury increased more than tt 47,000.001.
Unless government bonds are to be constantÂ­
ly issued and sold to replenish our exhausted
gold, only to be again exhausted, it is apparent
that the operation of the silver purchase law
now in force leads in the direction of the entire
substitution of silver for the gold in the govÂ­
ernment treasury and that this must be folÂ­
lowed by the payment of all government obliÂ­
gations in depreciated silver.
At this stage gold and silver must part comÂ­
pany and the government must fail in its estabÂ­
lished policy to maintain the two metals on a
parity with each other.
Given over to the exclusive use of a curÂ­
rency greatly depreciated, according to the
standard of the commercial world, we could
no longer claim a place among the nations of
the first class, nor could our government claim
a performance of its obligation, so far as such
an obligation has been imposed upon it, to
provide for the use of the people the best and
safest money. If, as many of its friends claim,
silver ought to occupy a higher place in our
currency and the currency of the world through
general international co-operation and agreeÂ­
ment, it is obvious that the United States will
not be in a position to gain a hearing in favor
of such an arrangement so long as we are will
ing to continue our attempt to accomplish the
result single handed.
The knowledge in business circles among onr
own people that our government cannot make
its fiat equivalent to intrinsic values nor keep
inferior mon?y on a parity with superior money
by its own independent efforts, has resulted in
such a lack of confidence at home, in the
stability of currency values that capital refuses
its aid to new enterprises while millions
ire actually withdrawn from the channels of
trade and commerce to become idle and unproÂ­
ductive in the hands of timid owners. Foreign
investors, equally alert, not only decline to
purchase American securities, but make haste
to sacrifice those whii'h they already have.
It does not meet the situation to say that apÂ­
prehension in regard to the f jture of our
finances is groundless and that there is no
eason for lack of confidence in the purposes
or power of the government in the premises
The very existence of this apprehension and
lack of confidence, however caused, is a menace
which ought not for a moment be disregarded
Possibly if the undertaking we have in hand
were the maintenance of a specific known
quantity of silver at a parity with gold, onr
ability to do so might be estimated and gauged
and perhaps, in view of our unparalleled grob
and resources, might be favorably passed upon.
But, when our avowed endeavor is to maintain
such parity in regard to an amount of silver inÂ­
creasing at the rate of 130,000,000 yearly, with
no fixed termination to such increase, it can
hardly be said that a problem is presented
whose solution is free from doubt.
The people of the United States are entitled
o a sound and stable currency and to money
recognized as such on every exchange and in
every market of the world Their government
has no right to injure them by financial expert
meets opposed to the policy and practice of
other civilized states. Nor is it Justified in
permitting an exaggerated and unreasonable
reliance on our national strength and ability to
jeopardize the soundness of the people's money.
This matter rises above the plane of party
politics. It vitally concerns every business and
callin? and enters every household in the land
There is one important aspect of the subject
which especially should never be overlooked

At times like the present, when the ems ot
unsound final, ce threaten us, the speculator
may anticipate a harvest gathered from toe
misfortunes of others: the capitalist may proÂ­
tect himself by boarding or may even find
profit in the fluctuation of values: but the
wage earner, the first to be Injured by a deÂ­
preciated currency and the last to receive the
benefit of its correction, is practically defenseÂ­
less. He relies for work upon the ventures of
confident and contented capital This falling
him, his condition is without alleviation, for he
can neither prey upon the misfortunes of othÂ­
ers nor hoard his labor.
One of the greatest statesmen our counts?
has known, speaking more than fifty years
ago when a derangement of the currency had
caused commercial distress, said: -The -err

man of all others who has the deepest interest
in sound currency and who suffers by misÂ­
chievous legislation in monetary matters is
the man who nrns his daily bread by his
daily toiL"" These words are as pertinent now
as on the Cay they were uttered and ought to
impressively remind us that a failure in the disÂ­
charge of our duty at this time must especially
injure those of our countrymen who labor and
who because of their number and condition are
entitled to the most watchful care ot their govÂ­
ernment.It Is of the utmost importance that such re
lief as congress can afford in the existing situa-
ion be afforded at once. The maxim. ""He
gives twice who gives quickly,"" is directly ap
plicable It may be true that the embarrass
ments from which the country is suffering arise
as much from evils apprehended as from
those actually existing. We may hope, too,
that calm counsels will prevail and that
neither the capitalists nor the wage earners
will give way to unreasoning panic and sacÂ­
rifice their property or their interests under
the influence of exaggerated fears. Neverthe
less, every day's delay in removing one of the
plain and principal causes of the present state
of things enlarges the mischief already don
and increased the responsibility of the governÂ­
ment for its existence. Whatever else the
people have a right to expect from congress,
they may certainly demand that legislation
condemned by the ordeal of three years' dis
astrous experience shall be removed from the
statute books as soon as their representatives
can legitimately deal with it.
It was my purpose to summon concrress in
special session early in the coming September
that we might enter promptly upon the work of
tariff reform, which the true interests of
the country clearly demand, which so large a
majority of the people, as shown by their
suffrages, desire and expect, and to the accom
plishment of which every effort of the present
administration is pledged. But while tariff re
form has lost nothing of its immediate and per
manent importance, and must in the near fu
ture engage the attention of congress, it has
seemed to me that the financial condition of
the country should at once and before all other
subjects be consid?red by your honorable body.
I earnestly recommend the prompt repeal ol
the provisions of the act passed July 14, 169.1,
authorizing the purchase of silver bullion, and
that other legislative action may put beyond all
doubt or mistake the intention and the ability
of the government to fulfill its pecuniary obliga
tions in money universally recognized by all
civilized countries. Groter Cleveland.

DIFFERENCES OF OPINION.
How Various Senators and Representa
tive Viewed the Message.
Washixgtox, Aug. 9. The message
of the president was received by conÂ­
gress with a degree of attention and
earnestness that has seldom been acÂ­
corded to that state paper.
A noticeable fact was the general ab
sence of adverse criticism from a party
point of view and among those who
have reserved an expression of their
judgment, the democrats were quite as
numerous as the republicans. For in
stance, Mr. Voorhees, chairman of the
finance committee, declined positively
to be interviewed on the message and
Mr. Hill, of New York, did the same.
Senator Gorman said: ""The message
is a clear cut statement of the presiÂ­
dent's views. All of the comment that
I have heard in the senate is that it is
as terse and clear a statement as could
have been made.""
Senator Cockrell, chairman of the
appropriation committee, when pressed
for an opinion, said:
""I am not sure that I understand
fully the purport of the message and
until I have read it carefully I cannot
express an opinion.""
Senator Allison, one of the leading
financial lights of the country, was very
conservative in his expressions of opinÂ­
ion. He remarked:
""It is a very fair message. lie states
truly that the Sherman act was a comÂ­
promise between the free silver men
and those who opposed their views.
Senator Jones, of Nevada I think
the message is utterly illogical and
does not analyze the situation at alL
The Sherman law has nothing to do
with the present condition of affairs.
The lines are drawn for the battle and
I see no reason for the friends of repeal
to think they can carry their measure
through. The message is what is exÂ­
pected and will do little to help the
cause which the president champions.
Senator Teller The simple assertion
of the president that the present finanÂ­
cial condition is due to the Sherman
law does not make iso. His premise
is wrong, and his conclusions necessariÂ­
ly fall to the ground.
Representative Simpson (populist),
Kansas, said: ""It is the weakest mesÂ­
sage ever presented to the country.
Weak as dishwater does not express it
The president's reference to the labor
question is the veriest rot.""
Senators Quay, Hawley, Loge and
McPherson were well pleased with the
recommendations regarding finances.
Senator Allison thought that the
tariff utterances of the president were
calculated to disturb business further
at a very critical time.
Mr. Burke Cock ran, of"" New York,
who is expected to lead the anti-silver
forces on the floor of the house, said:
""Admirable; most admirable. Even
the silver men must admit that it is the
most perfect presentation of the quesÂ­
tion that could be made.""
Senator Peffer The banker will re
gard it as perfection, the farmer and
workman will .see in it a further reducÂ­
tion of the product of their farm and
their labor. It is the first attack of
money kings in their final struggle for
supremacy.
Representative Bland, of Missouri,
the Moses of the free coinage men,
said: "".As nearly as I could make out,
it was a plea for a single gold standard
because England maintains it. If EnÂ­
gland would coin silver probably this
country would do so. We seem to have
lost the spirit of 1776."" RepresentaÂ­
tives Bynum and Harter commended
the message in the highest terms. So
did Messrs. Springer and Holman.
Representative McMillin, of TenÂ­
nessee, heartily approved the messageÂ­
Representative Bell(populist-democratic),
Colorado, said: ""It is an unÂ­
mistakable gold standard paper. It ia
in direct conflict with the platform and
doctrines of the party for the past twenÂ­
ty years: It is the argument made by
Sherman and the money power. It
makes the silver forces more deterÂ­
mined. It did not seem to impress tha
silver democrats. I believe it will help
the silver cause.""

The Nicaragua Canal Commission, which

terms of the act approved March , 1899.
for the purpose of examining the American
Isthmus with a view to determining the
most practicable and feasible route for a
ship canal across that isthmus, with Its
probable cost, and other essential details.
This Commission, under the presidency
of Rear Admiral John G. Walker, U. S. N.
(retired), entered promptly upon tho work
entrusted to It, and Is now carrying on
examinations in Nicaragua along the route
ot the Panama Canal, and in Darlen from
the Atlantic, in the neighborhood ot the
Atrato River, to the Bay of Panama, on
the Pacific side. Good progress has been
made, but under the law a comprehensive
and complete Investigation is called for,
which will require much labor and conÂ­
siderable time for its accomplishment.
The work will lie prosecuted as expediÂ­

the earliest practicable date.
The great Imparlance of this work cannot
be too often or too strongly pressed upon
the attention ot the Congress. In my MesÂ­

of the necessity f a canal which would

and the opening of the potts of Kan king,
Teing-tao (Klao chao), and Ta-llen-wan to
foreign trade and settlement will doubtless
afford American enterprise additional faÂ­
cilities and new fields, of which it will not
be slow to take advantage.
In my Message to Congress of DecemÂ­
ber 5, 1898, I 'urged that the recommendaÂ­
tions which had been made to the Speaker
ot the House ot Representatives by the
Secretary of the Treasury on the 14th of
June, 1898, for an appropriation for,a, comÂ­
mission to study the commercial 'and inÂ­
dustrial conditions In the Chinese Empire
and report as to the opportunities for, and
obstacles to, the enlargement ot markets
in China for the raw products and manuÂ­
factures of the-Unlted States, should reÂ­
ceive at your hands the consideration
which its importance and timeliness' merÂ­
ited, but the Congress failed to' take acÂ­
tion.I now renew this recommendation, as the
j importance of the subject has steadily
grown since it was first-submitted to you.
and no time should be lost In studying for
ourselves tho resources of this great field
for American trade and enterprise.

The I'arlu'Elpoaltion. '
Preparations for the representation of
the industries, arts, and products of the
United States at the WorWs Exposition
to be held in Paris next year continue on
an elaborate and comprehensive .scale
thanks to the generous appropriation proÂ­
vided by Congress and to the friendly InÂ­
terest the French Government has shown
In furthering a. typical exhibit of American
progress.
There has been allotted to the United
States a considerable addition ot space,
which, while placing our country in the
first rank among exhibitors, does net sufÂ­
fice to meet the Increasingly urgent deÂ­
mands ot our manufacturers. The efforts
of the Commissioner General are ably diÂ­
rected toward a strictly representative disÂ­
play of all that moat characteristically
marks American achievement in the InvenÂ­
tive arts, and most adequately shows the
excellence of our natural productions.
In this age of keen rivalry among nations
for mastery in commerce, the doctrine of
evolution and the rule ot the survival
of the fittest must be as inexorable In their
operation as they are positive In the results
they bring about. The place won in the
struggle by an Industrial peepic can only
ba held by unrclaxed endeavor- and conÂ­
stant advance in achievement. The presÂ­
ent extraordinary impetus In every line
of American exportation and the astoundÂ­
ing Increase In the volume and value ot our
share In tho world's markets may not b
attributed to accidental, .condUIoas,
The reasons are net far to seek. They
He deep in our national character and
find expression year by year in eery
branch of handicraft. In every new device
whereby the materials we so abundantly
produce are subdued to the artisan's will
and made to yield tho largest, most pracÂ­
tical, and most beneficial return. The
American exhibit at Paris should, and I
am confident will, be nn cnen volume.
whose lessons of skillfully directed en
deavor, unfaltering energy, and consumÂ­
mate performance may be read by all on
every page, thus spreading abroad a clearer
knowledge of the worth of our productions
and the Justice ot our claim to an imporÂ­
tant place In the marts of the world. To
accomplish this- by judicial' 'selection, by
recognition of paramount merit In whatÂ­
ever walk of trade or manufacture It may
appear, and by orderly classification and
attractive installation Is the task of our
Commission.
The United States Government build
ing is approaching completion, and no efÂ­
fort will be spared to make It worthy. In
beauty of architectural plan and in comÂ­
pleteness of display, to represent our naÂ­
tion. It has been suggested that a perÂ­
manent building of similar or appropriate
design be erected on a convenient site,
already given by the municipality; near
the Exposition grounds, to serve In comÂ­
memoration of the part taken by this
country in this great enterprise, as an
American National Institute, for our
countrymen resorting to Paris for study.
I am informed by our Commissioner Gen
eral that we shall have In the American
section at Paris over 7,000 exhibitors, from
every State in our country, a number ten
times as great as those which were repÂ­
resented at Vienna in 1873, six times es
many as those in Paris iir 1878, and four
times as many as those exhibited In Paris
In 18S9. This statement does not Include
the exhibits from either Cuba, Porto Rieo,
or Hawaii, for whlph arrangements have
been made.
A number of important International
congresses on special toplc3 affecting pubÂ­
lic Interests arc proposed to be held in
Paris next summer in connection with the
Exposition. Effort -will be made to have
the several technical branches of our AdÂ­
ministration efficiently represented at
those confercexs, each In its special line,
and to procure the largest poes.ble conÂ­
course ot State representatives, particuÂ­
larly at the Congresses of Public Charity
and of Medicine.
GENERAL RELATIONS ABROAD.
Our Friendly iDterconae With GerÂ­
many and England.
Our relations with Germany continue to
be most cordial. The Increasing intimacy
of direct association has been marked
during the year by the granting permission
in April for the landing on our shores of
a cable from Borkum Emden, on the North
Sea, by way of the Azores, and also by the
conclusion on September 2 of a Parcels
Post Convention wllh tho German Empire.
In all that promises closer 'relations of
Intercourse and commerce and a better
understanding between the two races havÂ­
ing so many traits In common, Germany
can be assured of the, most, cordial coÂ­
operation ot this Government and people.
We may be rivals In many material paths,
but our rivalry should be generous and
open, ever aiming toward the attainment
of larger results and the mutually beneÂ­
ficial advancement of each in the line
of its especial adaptabilities. x.
The several Governments of the Empire
seem reluctant to admit the natural exÂ­
cellence of our food productions and to
accept the evidence we constantly tender
ot the care with which their parity is
guarded by rigid inspection from the farm,
through the slaughter house and the pack
ing establishments, .to the port ot shipÂ­
ment. Our system of control over exportÂ­
ed food staples invites examination from
any quarter and challenges rcrpect by its
efficient the roughness.
It Is t be hoped that in time the two
Governments will act in common accord toÂ­
ward the realization of their common purÂ­
pose to safeguard- the public health and to
ensure the purity and wholesomeness ot
all food products imported by either counÂ­
try from the other. Were the Congress' to
authorize an invitation to Germany, In conÂ­
nection with the pending reciprocity neÂ­
gotiations, for the constitution ot a. joint
commission of scientific experts and pracÂ­
tical men of affairs to conduct a searching
investigation ot food production and exÂ­
portation in both countries and report to
their respective legislatures for-the adopÂ­
tion of such remedial measures as they
might recommend for either; ""the way might

Subsequent tb the exchange of our peace

therefor $3,000,600. Assurances have been
received from the German Government that

traders there will be considerately obÂ­
served. Canada.
In my last Annual Message I referred
to the pending negotiations with Great
Britain in respect to the Dominion ol
Canada. By means of an executive agreeÂ­
ment a Joint High Commission had been
created for the, purpose of adjusting all
unsettled questions between the United
States and Canada, embracing twelve sub-
jects, among which were the questions of
the fur seals, the fisheries of the coast,
and contiguous Inland waters, the Alaskan
boundary, the transit ot merchandise In
bond, the alien labor laws, mining rights,
reciprocity In trade, revision of the agreeÂ­
ment respecting naval vessels in the Great
Lakes, a more complete marking of parts
of the boundary, provision for the conveyÂ­
ance of criminals, and for wrecking and
salvage.
Much progress bad been made by the
Commission toward the adjustment of
many of these questions, when It became
apparent that an irreconcilable difference
of views was entertained respecting the
delimitation ot the Alaskan boundary. In
the failure ot an agreement as to the
meaning of Articles 3 and 4 of the treaty
ot 1S25 between Russia and Great Britain,
which defined the boundary between Alaska
and Canada, the American Commissioners
proposed that the subject of the boundary
be laid aside and that tho remainÂ­
ing questions of difference be proÂ­
ceeded with, some of which were so
far advanced as to assure the probability
of a settlement. ThU being declined by
the British Commissioners, an adjournment
was taken until the boundary should be
adjusted by the two Governments. The
subject has been receiving the careful atÂ­
tention which its Importance demands,
with the result that a modus Vivendi for
provisional demarcations In the region
about the head ot Lynn Canal has been
agreed upon; and it is hoped that the neÂ­
gotiations now in progress between the two
Governments will end In an agreement for
the establishment and delimitation of a
permanent boundary.
Apart from these questions growing out
of our relationship with our northern
neighbor, the most friendly dlspo:ltlon and
ready agreement have marked the discusÂ­
sion of numerous matters arising in the
vast and Intimate. Intercourse of the United
States with threat .Britain.
jflic Boer AVnr.
This Government has maintained an atÂ­
titude of neutrality In the unfortunate conÂ­
test between1 Great Britain and the Boer
States ot Africa. HVe have remained faithÂ­
ful to the precept of avoiding entangling
alliances as ""to affairs not of our direct
concern. Had circumstances suggested that
the parties loathe quarrel would have welÂ­
comed any klndlyycxprcsslon of the hope
of the American people that war might be
averted, good offices would have been
gladly tendered. The United States repÂ­
resentative at Pretoria was early InÂ­
structed to see that all neutral American
Interests be 'respected by the combatants.
This has been an easy task In view ot the
positive decliratlcms of both British and
Boer authorities' Ihaf-Hho personal and
property rights of our citizens should be
observed.
Upon the withdrawal of the British agent
from Pretoria the United States consul
was authorized, upon the request of the
British Government and with the assent
of the South African and Orange Free
State Governments, to exercise the cusÂ­
tomary good offices of a neutral for the.
care of British Interests. In the discharge
of this function I am happy to say that
abundant opportunity has been afforded to
show the Impartiality of this Government
toward both the combatants.
For the fourth time In the present decade
question has arisen with the Government
of Italy In regard to the lynching of
Italian subjects. The latest of these deÂ­
plorable events occurred at Tallulah. La.,
whereby five unfortunates of Italian origin
were taken from Jail and hanged.
The authorities of the State and a repreÂ­
sentative of the Italian Embassy ha!ng
separately Investigated the occurrence,
with discrepant results, particularly as to
the alleged citizenship of the victims, and
It not appearing that the State had been
able to discover and punish the lolators
of the law, an independent investigation
has been set on foot, through the agency
of the Department of State, and is still
in progress. The result will enable the
Executive to treat the question with the
Government of Italy In a spirit of fairness
and Justice. A satisfactory solution will
doubtless be reached.
The recurrence of these distressing maniÂ­
festations of blind mob fury directed at
dependents or natives of a rorclgn country
sugests that the contingency has arisen
for action by Congress In the direction of
conferring upon the Federal courts JurisÂ­
diction In this class of International cases
where the ultimate responsibility ot the
Federal Government may be Involved. The
suggestion is not new. In his Annual MesÂ­
sage of December 9, 1891, my predecessor.
President Harrison, saidr
It would. I believe, be entirely competent for
Congn-j lo make offences agairu-t the treaty
right of foreigners domiciled in the United
States cognizable in the Federal courts. This has
not. however, been done, and the Federal officers
and cocuta haie no power in such eases to inter
vene either for the protection of a foreign citizen
or for the punishment of his slj-ers. It seems
to me to follow-, in th;s state of"" the law, that
the c-facers of the State charged with police
and judicial iiowers in such caes must, in the
consideration of International questions growing
out of such incidents, be regarded in fuch t-ense
u Federal agents as to male tlir f:o eminent anÂ­
werable for their acta in cases where it would
be answerable If the United Statea had ueed its
constitutional power lo define and puttUii crimen
against treaty rights.
THE TREATS SIGHTS OP ALIENS.
A Strong; Appeal for Justice- In the
'Matter.
A bill to provide for the punishment of
violations of treaty-'rights of aliens was
introduced In the Senate March 1, 1892,
and reported favorably March 30. Having
doubtless in view t&e language of that
part of Article frl of the treaty ot FebruÂ­
ary 26, 1871, between the United States
and Italy, whicbstipulates that ""The citÂ­
izens oteach.ofjtbc high contracting parÂ­
tics shall receive, ins-the States and. TerÂ­
ritories of the other-; most constant proÂ­
tection and security for their persons and
property, and shall -enjoy In this respect
the same rlghtsiandjprivlleges as are, or
shall be granted 40 the natives, on their
submitting themselves to the conditions
imposed upon the natives,"" the bill so inÂ­
troduced and reported provided that any
act committed In any State or Territory
of the United States in violation ot the
rights ot a citizen or subject of a foreign
country secured to such citizen or subject
by treaty between the United States and
suth foreign country and constituting a
crime under the laws of the State or TerÂ­
ritory, shall constitute a like crime against
the United States and be cognizable In the
Federal courts. No action was taken by
Congress in the matter.
I earnestly recommend that the subject
be taken up anew and acted upon during
the present session. The necessity for
some such provision' abundantly appears.
Precedent for constituting a Federal jurisÂ­
diction in criminal cases where aliens are
sufferers is rationally deduclble from the
existing statute, which gives to the district
and circuit courts ot the United States
jurisdiction ot civil suits broueht by sjiccs

where the amount involved exceeds a cer-

tain turn, it sucn jealous soiicuuae ne
buvu .nu ,,,""i m .., w. ..,,
civil and -pecuniary Import, how 'much
greater should be the public duty to take
. cognizance of matters affecting the life
, and the rights ot aliens under the settUcT
i principles of international law no less than
under' treaty stipulation, in cases of such
transcendent wrong-doing as mob murder,
especially When experience ha; shown that
local Justice is too often he.pless to punÂ­
ish the offenders.
After many years of endeavor on the part
ot this Government to that end the Italian
Government, has consented to enter into
negotiations for a naturalization convenÂ­
tion, having for one ot Its objects the regÂ­
ulation of the status of Italians (except
those of an age for active military service)
who, having been naturalized in the united.
States, may revisit Italy. It Is hoped that
wita the mutually conciliatory spirit disÂ­
played a successful conclusion will be
reached.
The treaty of commerce and navigation
between the United States and Japan on
November 22, 1894, took effect in accord
ance with the terms of its XlXth Arll.le
on the 17th of July last, simultaneously
with the enforcement of like treaties with
the other powers, except France, whose
convention did not go into operation until
August 4. the -United States being, howÂ­
ever, granted up to that date all the privÂ­
ileges and rights accorded to French cit
izens under the old French treaty. By
this notable conventional reform Japan's
position as a fully independent sovereign
power is assured, control being gained of
taxation, customs revenues, judicial adÂ­
ministration, coasting trade, and all other
domestic functions ot government, and forÂ­
eign extraterritorial rights being reÂ­
nounced.c, Forelo-a .Courtesies;.
Comprehensive codes ot civil and crimiÂ­
nal procedure according to Western methÂ­
ods, public instruction, patents and copyÂ­
rights, municipal administration, includÂ­
ing Jurisdiction over the former foreign
settlements, customs tariffs and procedure,
public health, and other Administrative
measures have been proclaimed. The workÂ­
ing of the new system has given rise to
jo material complaints on the part ot the
American citizens or Interests, a circumÂ­
stance which attests the ripe consideraÂ­
tion with which the change ha3 been preÂ­
pared.Valuable assistance was rendered by the
Japanese authorities to the United States
transport ship Morgan City while stranded
at Kobe. Permission has been granted to
land and pasture army horses at Japanese
ports of call on the way to the Philippine
Islands. These kindly evidences of good
will are highly appreciated.
The Japanese Government has shown a
lively Interest in the proposition of the
Pacific Cable Company to add to its proÂ­
jected cable lines to Hawaii, Guam, and
the Philippines a branch connection with
the coast of Japan. It would be a gratiÂ­
fying consummation were the utility ot
the contemplated scheme enhanced by
bringing Japan and the United States into
direct telegraphic relation.
Without repeating the observation! of
my special Message of February 10, 1S99,
concerning the necessity cf a cable to
Manila. I respectfully Invite attention to it.
I recommend that. In ceoe the Congress
should not take measures to bring about
this result by direct aetlon of the GovÂ­
ernment, the Postmaster General be auÂ­
thorized to incite competitive bids for the
establishment of a cable: the company
making the best responsible bid to be
awarded, the contract; the successful comÂ­
pany to give ample bonds to insure the
completion of 'the work within a reasonÂ­
able time.
The year has been marked by constant
Increase in- the Intimacy of our relations
with Mexico and In the magnitude of muÂ­
tually advantageous Interchanges. This
Government has omitted no opportunity
to shov its strong desire to develop and
perpetuate the ties cf cordiality now so
long happily unbroken.
Following the termination on January
20. 1899. by Mexico of the convention of
extradition of December 11, 1SS1, a newÂ­
treaty more in accordance with the asÂ­
certained needs of loth countries was
signed February 22. 1S99. and exchanged
In the City ot Mexico on the 22d of April
last. Its operation thus far has been
effectUe and satisfactory. A recent case
has"" served to test the application of Its
IVth -Article, which provides that
neither party shall bo bound to deliver
up Its own citizens, but that the executive
authority of each shall have the power
to deliver them up If in Its discretion it
be deemed proper to do so.
The Itlcu Cane.
Tho extradition ot Mrs. Mattie Rich, a
citizen ot the United States, charged with
homicide committed In Mexico, was after
mature consideration directed by me in the
conviction that the ends of Justice-would be
thereby subserved. Similar action, on apÂ­
propriate occasion, by the Mexican ExecuÂ­
tive will not only tend to accomplish the
desire of both Governments that grave
crimes go not unpunished, but also to reÂ­
press lawlessness along the the border of
the two countries. The new treaty stipuÂ­
lates that neither Government shall asÂ­
sume jurisdiction in the punishment ot
crimes committed exclusively within the
territory of the other. This will obviate in
future the embarrassing controversies
which have heretofore arisen through MexÂ­
ico's assertion of a claim to try and punish
an American citizen for an offence commitÂ­
ted within the jurisdiction of the United
States.
The International Water Boundary ComÂ­
mission, organized by the convention of
March 1. 1SS9, for the adjustment of quesÂ­
tions affecting the Rio Grande frontier, has
not set completed Its labors. A further
extension of its term for one year, until
December 24, 1SS9, was- effected by a conÂ­
vention eigced December 2. 1SSS, and exÂ­
changed and proclaimed in February last.
An Invitation extended to the President of
Mexico to visit Chicago iu October, on the
occasion of laying the corner-stone of
the United States Government building
in that city, was cordially accepted by him,
with the necessary consent of the Mexican
Congress, but the Illnees of a member ot his
family prevented his attendance."" The MinÂ­
ister of Foreign Relations, however, came
as the personal representative of President
Diaz, and In that high character was dulj
honored.
Claims growing out of the seizure ot
American scaling vessels In Bering Sea
cave been under discussion with the GovÂ­
ernment of Russia for several years, with
the recent happy result cf an agreement In
submit them to the decision ot a single arÂ­
bitrator. By this act Russia affords proof
of her adherence to the heneficent principle
of arbitration which her plenipotentiaries
conspicuously favored at The Hague DisÂ­
armament Conference, when it was advoÂ­
cated by the representatives of the United
States.
A suggestion for a permanent exposition
cf our products and manufactures in Russia,
although not yet fully shaped, has been
so cordially welcomed by the Imperial GovÂ­
ernment that It may not inaptly take a
fitting place in whatever legislation the
Congress may adopt looking to enlargeÂ­
ment ot our commercial opportunities
abroad.
THE SAMOAN ISLANDS.
A Satlfnctor- Arrangement ""With
lCnc;lnnl and Germany.
Important events have occurred In the
Samoan Islands. The election, according
to the laws and customs ot Samoa, ot a
successor to the late King, Malictoa LauÂ­
pepa, developed a contest a3 to the validity
of the result, which Issue, by the terms of
the General Act. vjes to be decided by theÂ­
Chief Justice. Upon his rendering a judgÂ­
ment in favor of Malletoa. Tanu, the rivat
chief, Mataafa, took up arms. The active
Intervention of American and British war
shlp3 became imperative to restore order,
at the cost ot sanguinary encounters. In
this emergency a joint commission of rep-,
rescntatives of the United States, Germany,
and Great Britain was sent to Samoa to
investigate the situation, and provide s

temporary remedy. By its active efforts
a peaceful solution was reached for the
time being, the kingship being abolished
and a provisional government established.
Recommendations unanimously made by
the commission for a permanent ""adjustÂ­
ment ot the Simoan question were taken
u-der consideration by the three powers
parties to the General Act. But the more
they were examined the' more evident it
became that a radical change was necesÂ­
sary In the relations of the powers to
Samoa.
The inconveniences and possible perils
of tbe tripartite scheme of supervision
and control in the Samoan group by powers
having little interest in common in that
quarter beyond commercial rivalry had
been once more emphasized by the
recent events. The suggested remedy
of the Joint Commission, like the
scheme It aimed to replace, amountÂ­
ed to what has been styled a trlÂ­
dominlum, being the exercise of the funcÂ­
tions of sovereignty by sn unanimous
agreement of three powers. The situation
had become far more Intricate and embarÂ­
rassing from every point of view than It
was when my predecessor. In 1894, summed

up Its perplexities and condemned the parÂ­
ticipation in It ot the United States.
The arrangement under which Samoa
was administered had proved impracticaÂ­
ble and unacceptable to all the powers
concerned. To withdraw from the agreeÂ­
ment and abandon the islands to Germany
and Great Brltatn would not be compatiÂ­
ble with our interests in the archipelago.
To rellnquiih our rights In the harbor of
Pago Pago, the best anchorage fn the Pa
cific, the occupancy ot which had been
leased to the United States lo 1878 by the
first foreign treaty ever concluded, by
Samoa, was not to be tbcught ot either
as regards the needs of cur Navy or the
Interests of ourtgrowlng commerce with
the East. We could not have considered
any proposition for the abrogation ot the
trlnartlte control which did not confirm
us in all our rights and safeguard all our
national interests in tbe islands.
Our views commended themselves to tbe
other powers.. A satisfactory arrangement
was concluded between the Governments
of Germany and of England by virtue of
which England retired from Samoa in view
of compensations in other directions, and
both powers renounced In favor of the
.United States all their rights and claims
over and in respect to that portion of the
group lying to the east of tbe one hun
dred and seventy-first degree of west long
itude, embracing the Islands of autulla.
Ofoo, Olosenga, and Manua. I transmit to
the Senate, for its constitutional action
thereon, a convention, which besides the
Drovlslons above mentioned also guaran
tees us the same privileges and conditions
in respect to commerce and commercial
vessels in all ot tbe islands of Samoa as
those possessed by Germany.
Claims have been preferred by while
residents of Samoa on account of Injuries
alleged to have been suffered through the
acts of the treaty Governments in putting
down the late disturbances. A convention
has been made between the three powers
for the investigation and settlement of
these claims by a neutral arbitrator, to
which the attention of the Secale will be
invited.
Peace A Itli Mmln.
My Annual Message of last year was necÂ­
essarily devoted in great part to a considÂ­
eration of the Spanish war and of the reÂ­
sults It wrought and the conditions It ImÂ­
posed for the future. I am gratified to
announce that the treaty of peace has reÂ­
stored friendly relations between the two
powers. Effect has been given to its most
Important provisions- . The-evacuation of
Porto Rico having already been accomÂ­
plished en the ISth of October. 1S9S, nothÂ­
ing remained necessary there but to conÂ­
tinue the provisional military control of
the Island until the Congress should enact a
suitable government for the ceded terriÂ­
tory. Of the character and scope of the
measures to that end I shall treat in anÂ­
other part of this Message.
GOVERNMENT OF CUBA.
America Intention Ke-c-nrdincr the
Inland Detiac-d.
The withdrawal of the authority of Spain
from the Island of Cuba was effected by
the 1st of January, so that the full rcÂ­
cstablishment of peace, found the relinÂ­
quished territory held by us in trust for the
inhabitants, maintaining, under the direcÂ­
tion of the Executive, such government
and control therein a3 should conserve pubÂ­
lic order, restore the productive contritions
of peace so long disturbed by the Instability
and disorder which prevailed for the greater
part of the preceding three decades, and
build up that tranquil development of the
domestic state whereby alone can be realÂ­
ized the high purpose, as proclaimed in the
joint resolution adopted by the Congress
on the 19th of April. 1898, by which the
United States disclaimed any disposition or
intention to exercise sovereignty. JurisdicÂ­
tion, or ccntrol over Cuba, except for the
pacification thereof, and asserted Its deterÂ­
mination when that was accomplished to
leave the government and control of the
Island to its people. The pledge contained.
in this resolution is of tha highest honorÂ­
able obligation and must be sacredly kept,
I believe that substantial progress has
been made In this direction. All the adÂ­
ministrative measures adopted in Cuba have
aimed to fit it for a. regenerated existence
by enforcing the supremacy of law and
justice; by placing wherever practicable
the machinery of administration in the
hands of the inhabitants; by instituting
needed sanitary reforms; by spreading edu
cation; by fostering Industry and trade: by
Inculcating public morality, and. In short,
by taking every rational step to aid the
Cuban people to attain to that plane of eIfÂ­
conscious respect and self-reliant unit
which fits an eclightened community for
self-government within its own sphere,
while enabling It to fulfill all outward obÂ­
ligations;A Grave RefsiionMihility.
This nation has assumed before the
world a grave responsibility for the future
good government ot Cuba. We have acÂ­
cepted a trust the fulfillment ot which calls
for the sternest integrity cf purpose and
the exercise of the highest wisdom. The
new Cuba yet to arise from the ashes of
the past must needs be bound to us by tics
of singular Intimacy and strength If its
enduring welfare Is to be assured. Whether
those ties shall be organic or conventional,
the destinies of Cuba are In eome rightful
form and manner Irrevocably linked with
our own, but bow and how far i3 for the
future to determine in tho ripeness ol
events. Whatever be the outcome, we must
see to it that free Cuba be a reality, net a
name, a perfect entity, not a hasty experiÂ­
ment bearing within Itself the elements of
failure. Our mission, to accomplish which
we took up the wager of battle, is cot to
bo fulfilled by turning adrift any loosely
framed commonwealth to face the vicissiÂ­
tudes which too often attend weaker states
whose natural wealth and abundant reÂ­
sources are offset by the incongruities ol
their political organization and the recurÂ­
ring occasions for internal rivalries to sap
their strength and dissipate their energles.Â­
The greatest blessing which can come to
Cuba is the restoration ot her agricultural
and Industrial prosperity, which will give
employment to Idle men and rc-cstablsh
the pursuits of peace. This is her chict
and Immediate need.
rhr- Cnlmn Census.
On the 19th of August last an order was
made for tbe taking of the census In the
island, to be completed on the 30th of NoÂ­
vember. By the treaty of peace the SpanÂ­
ish people on the island have until April
11, 1900. to elect whether they will remain
citizens of Spain or become citizens of
Cuba. Until then it cannot be definitely
ascertained who shall be entitled to parÂ­

tbe census will have been tabulated and

by the people. The experience thussc-oulred-
will prove of great value In the
formation ot a representative convention
of tbe people to draft a constitution and
establish a general system of independent
government for tbe Island. In the fiean
time and so long as we exercise control
over the island the products of Cuba should
have a market in the United- States on as
good terms and with as favorable rates of
duty as are given to the West India IslÂ­
ands under treaties of reciprocity which
shall be made.
For the relief of the distressed In the
island of Cuba the War Department has
Issued supplies to destitute persons
through tbe officers of the Army, which
have amounted to 5,493,000 rations, at a
cost of Jl.417,534.07.
To promote the disarmament of the CuÂ­
ban volunteer army, and In the Interest of
public peace and the welfare of the people,
tbe sum of $75 was paid to each CubanÂ­
soldier borne upon the authenticated rolls,
on condition that he abould deposit his
arms with the authorities designated by
the United States. The sum thus disbursed
aggregated 82,547,730, which was paid from
the emergency fund provided by-the act of
January C. 1SS9. for that pi-pose.

to Its consular representation in the United

are being released and returned to their

for defining the conventional relations beÂ­
tween the two ccuntrle3. which fell Into

that these will Include a favorable arrangeÂ­
ment for commercial reciprocity under thj
terms of sections 3 and 4 of the current
tariff act. In these, as in all matters of
International concern, no effcrt will ba
spared to respond to the good disposition
of Spain, and to cultivate in all practicable
ways the Intimacy which should prevail
between two nations whose past history
has so often and in as many ways been
marked by sincere friendship and by comÂ­
munity of interests.
I would recommend appropriate legislaÂ­
tion in order to carry Into execution ArÂ­
ticle VII cf the Treaty of Peace with Spain,
by which the United States assured tha
payment cf certain claims for indemnity
of Its citizens against Spain.
Tee United States minister to Turkey
continues, under instructions, to press for
a money payment in satisfaction of tha
just claims for injuries, suffered by AmeriÂ­
can citizens in the disorders of several
years past and for wrongs dene to them
by the Ottoman authorities. Some of these
claims are cf many years' standing. This
Government Is hopefuL cf a general agree
ment in this regard.
Onr Citizen In Turkey.
In the Turkish Empire the situation of
our citizens remains unsatisfactory. Our
efforts durcg nearly forty years tc bring
about a convention ot naturalization seem
to be on the brink ot final failure through
the announced policy of the Ottoman Porte
to refuse recognition of the alien status
cf native Turkish subjects naturalized
abroad since 1S57. Our statutes do not alÂ­
low this Government to admit any disÂ­
tinction between the treatment of native
and naturalized Americans abroad, so that
ceaseless controversy arises in cases where
persons owing in the eye of international
law a dual allegiance are prevented from
entering Turkey or are expelled after enÂ­
trance. Our law in this regard contrasts
with that of the European States. The
British act. for Instance, dees not claim
effect for the naturalization of an alien In
the event of his return to his native counÂ­
try, unless the change be recognized by the
law of that country or stipulated by treaty
between It and the naturalizing State.
The arbitrary treatment, in some inÂ­
stances, of American productions in Turkey
has attracted attention of late, notably in
regard to our flour. Large shipments by
the recently opened direct steamship line
to Turkish ports have been denied entrance
on the score that, although cf standard
composition and unquestioned purity, the
flour was pernicious to health because ot
deficient ""elasticity."" as Indicated by anÂ­
tiquated and untrustworthy tests. Upon
due protest by the American minister, and
it appearing that the act was a virtual
discrimination aganst our product, the
shipments in question were admitted. In
these, a3 in all instances, wherever occurrÂ­
ing, when American products may be subÂ­
jected in a foreign country, upon specious
pretexts, to discrimination compared with
the like products of another country, this
Government will use Its earnest efforts to
secure fair and equal treatment for Its citiÂ­
zens and their goods. Falling this, it will
not hesitate to apply whatever corrective
may be provided by the statutes.
THE VENEZUELAN BOUNDARY.
A fatlsfnetory Settlement of the DisÂ­
pute.The International Commission of ArbiÂ­
tration, appointed -under theAnglo-Venezuelan
treaty of 1S97, rendered an award
on October 3 last, whereby the boundary
line between Venezuela and British Guiana
is determined, thus ending a controversy
which has existed for the greater part of
the century. The award, as to which the
arbitrators were unanimous, while not
meeting tha extreme contention of either
party, gives to Great Britain a large share
cf the Interior territory in dispute and to
Venezuela the entire mouth of the OrinÂ­
oco, including Barima Point and the Car
ibbean littoral for some distance to ths
eastward. The decision appears to be
equally satisfactory to both parties.
Venezuela has once more undergone a
revolution. The Insurgents, under General
Castro, after a sanguinary engagement in
which they suffered much loss, rallied In
the mountainous interior and advanced
toward the capital. The bulk of tbe army
having sided with the movement. President
Andrade quitted Caracas, where General
Castro set up a provisional government
with which our minister and the representÂ­
atives of other powers entered into diploÂ­
matic relations on the 20th of November,
1S99.
The fourth section of the Tariff Act apÂ­
proved July 21, 1S97. appears to provide
only for commercial treaties which should
be entered into by the President and also
ratified by the Senate within two years
from Its passage. Owing to delays IneviÂ­
table In negotiations of this nature, none
ot the treaties Initiated under that section
could be concluded in time for ratification
by the Senate prior to Its adjournment on
the 4lh of March last. Some ot the pendÂ­
ing negotiations, however, were near conÂ­
clusion at that time, and the resulting
conventions have since been signed by the
plenipotentiaries. Others, within both the
third and fcurth sections cf the act, are
still under consideration. Acting under
the constitutional power cf the Executive
in respect to treaties. I have deemed It m.'
duty, while observing the limitations or
concession provided by the fourth section,
to bring to a conclusion all pending negoÂ­

ti ( ""





1I submitting my eighth and last
annual message to congress, it seems
proper thatÂ­ I should refer to and in
some degree recapittlate'the events
and oflicial acts of the past eight
vears. It was my fortune, or misÂ­
fortune, to be called to the office of
chilef executive without any previÂ­
ou training. From the age of sevÂ­
enteen I had never even witnessed
the excitement attending a presiÂ­
dential campaign but twice anteceÂ­
dent to my own candidacy and at
but one of them I Was eligible as a
voter. Upder .sch, ircpumstances
it is but reasonable ,'to';suppose that
,rnors of judgment must -have oeÂ­
curred, even had there been-no dif.
tPrunce of opinion between the eoxÂ­
ecotive, bound byan path to the
,trict pierformane oqf his'dutlesa and
writers and "" debaters.'"" It is not
necessarily evidence of a blunder on
the part of the executive, because.
there are those differences of views.
That mistakes have been', made all
can see and ;I admit; but. it' seeins
to nme oftener in the selections made
of assistants ppoinpted .ot d in carÂ­
rving outdthd carious defties of adÂ­
ininistering the government. In
nearly every case they were selected
without a personal acquaintance
with the appointees, but on recomÂ­
mendation of the representatives
chosen directly by the people. It is
impossible where somany trusts are
to be allotted, that the right parties
should be chosen in every instance.
History shows'that no admininstra
tion from the 'time of Washington
to the preseint has been free from
these mistakes. But I leave comÂ­
parisons to history, only claiming
that I have acted in every instance
from a conscientious desire to do
what was right,, constitutionally
within the law, for the, very
best interests of the whole people.
The failures have been errors of
the judgment and not of the heart.
My civil career commenced at the
utmost critical and difficult time,
less than four years before the counÂ­
try had emerged from a conflict
such as no other nation had surÂ­
vived. Nearly one-half of :.the
states had revolted against the govÂ­
ernment, and of these remaining
faithful to the union a large percentÂ­
age of the population sympathized
with the rebellion and made an
enemy in the rear almost as dangerÂ­
on as
as the more terrible enemy in
the front. The latter committed
errors of judgment, but they mainÂ­
tained them, openly and courageÂ­
ously. The former received the
protection of the government
they would see destroyed; and the
advantago to be gained out of the
then existing state of affairs, many
of them by obtaining contracts and
by swindling the government in the
delivery of their goods. ImmediÂ­
ately on the cessation of hostilities
the then noble president, who had
carried the country so fir through
its perils, fell a martyr to his patriÂ­
otism at the hands of an assassin.
The intervening time to my first
inauguration was filled up with
wrangling between congress and
the new executive as to
the best mode of reconstruction,
or, to speak plainly as to whether
the control of the government
should be thrown iummediately into
the hands of those who had recently
and persistently tried to destroy it,
or whether the victors should conÂ­
tinue to have an equal voice with
them in the control. ReconstrucÂ­
tion, as finally agreed upon, was
this and only this, except that the
late slave was enfranchised, giving
ain increase as was supposed to
the union-loving, union-supportÂ­
ing votes of the country, believÂ­
ing in the fullest sense of the
word they would' not' disappoint
thlis expectation. Hence at .the
beginning of my first adminÂ­
istration the :work of .reconÂ­
struction, much embarrassed by the
long delay, virtually commenced.
It was the work of the legislative
hIrnch of the government. My
province was wholly in approving
theiracts, which I did most heartily,
urging the legislatures of the states
that had not done so, to ratify the
fifteenth amendment to the constiÂ­
tution. The country was laboring
under an enormous debt, contracted
in the suppression of the rebellion,
and taxation was so oppressive as to
discourage productions. Another
danger also threatened us-a foreign
war. The last difficultyl had to
be adjusted, and was stisfactorily
adjusted without a war and in
a manner highly honorable to all
parties concerned.
The war debt has been reÂ­
tucedl within the last seven years
nearlys $0,00,i000. The national
debt has been reduced in the same
time over $435,000,000 by refunding
the six per cent. bonded debt for
bonds bearing five and four and a
half per cent. interest respectively.
The annual interest has been reÂ­
duced from over $130,000,000
in 1869 to, but little over
1t,(5,000,000 in 1876. The balance
of trade 'has been changed
from \ver S130,000,000 against the
United States in 1860 to mnore than
$120,000,000 in our favor in 1870. 'It
is confidently believed that the balÂ­
ance of trade in favor of the United
States will increase-not diminish,
and that the pledge of congress to
resume specie payment in 1870 will
he easily accomplished, even in the
absence of much desired further
legislation on the subject.
INDIAN AFFAIRS.
Apolicy has been adopted toward
the Indian tribes inhabiting a large
aortionoftheterritories oftheUnited
States, which has, been human,
and has substantially ended Indian
hostilities in the whole land
except in a portion of
Nebraska. and Dakota, WyÂ­
oming and Montana territories, the
Black-ililsre~ions and approaches
thedeto. Hostilities in there have
grown out of the avarice of the
white manlai; who has violated our
treaty stipulations in his search for
gold. The question might be asked
why the government has not etohÂ­




 forced obedience to the terms of the crimi
treaty, prohibiting the occupance of Th
the Black Hills region by the notiC
whites? The answer is simply that 1874
the first emigrants to the Black treat
Hills were removed by troops, but and i
rumnors and discoveries of gold :visio
took into that region increased there
numbers. Gold.has actually been term
'found in paying quantitles, and an June
effort to remove the' miners would invit
only result in the destruction of a concl
bulk of the troopl that might be act o
sent there. All diffiCUlty in the p
this matter has, however, been he s]
removed, subject. to approval of form,

not unfrequently. The United

expatriation, and has obtained, th
after a long struggle, an admission
of the principle contended for by of
acquiescence therein on part of many b
foreign powers, and by the concluÂ­ m
slon of treaties on that subject. It m
is, however, but Justice to the govÂ­ an

Ized citizens have formerly ar
owed allegiance, as well as th
to the United States, that certain co
fixed and definite rules should be re
adopted governing such cases, and th
providing how expatriation may be m
accomplished. While emigrants in lo
large numbers become citizens of
the United States, it is also true that sa
persons both native-born and natu. be

the effect of a series of. facts and rei

THE AUMY AND NAVY. th
The report of the secretary wi
of war shows that the army Phr
has been actively employed th
during the post year, in subduing, e
at the request of the Indian bureau, ve
certain wild bandsof Sioux Indians, of

during the election. The commission pr
constituted under act of July 24, co
1876 to consider and report on the
whole subject of reform and the reÂ­ is
organization of the whole army, in
in August last, has collected a us
large mass of statistics of points wi
bearing on the subject before it. de

am advised though by the president fro
of the commission that it will be ou
impracticable to comply with the an
clause of the act requiring a report ti
to be presented through me to conÂ­ th
gresson the first day of this session, pe
for want of time for that mature cr1
deliberation which the importance do
of the subject demands; therefore he
I ask that the time of making reÂ­ co
port be extended to the 29th of JanÂ­ co
uary, 1877. In accordance with the re
resolution of August 15, 1876, the ha
army regulations prepared under va

2. That congress sanction the estio
scheme of an annuity fund for the creas
benefit of the families of deceased dina
officers, and that it also provide for depa
the permanent organization of the yearr
regular service, both of which were of o'
recommended in my last annual whil
message. for ti
3. That the manufacturing operaÂ­ five
tions 'of the ordnance department and
be concentrated at three arsenals and rever
an armory, and that the remaining of ne
arsenals be sold and the proceeds
applied to this object by the ordÂ­ Th
nance department.
The appropriation for river and ofea
harbor improvements for the curÂ­ inter
rent year were $5,015,000. With
my approval, the secretary of war h
directed that of this amount $2,000,Â­ soil
000 should be expended, and no in th
new works should be begun and
none prosecuted which were not of and
national importance. Subsequently te i
this amount was increased to aid t
$223,700. Works are now progressÂ­ andi
ing on this basis. The improveÂ­ entifi
ment of the south pass of the
Mississippi river, under J. B. Euds al
and,.is assocatesL
, is. progressing

quired before payment shall be tand
made by the United States. A comÂ­ the
mission of engineers and officers is whic
now examining these works, and cost
their reports will be presented as nota
soon as received. atten
The report of the secretary ment
of the navy shows that he
believes the service to be in cepti
condition as effective as it is cludi
possible to keep it with the
ery
means the aproriations give thery
the department. It is, of course, not miss
possible to rival the costly and proÂ­ Th
gressive establishments of the great umbi
European powers. With the old boat
material of our navy, to which no too I
increase has been authorized since
the war except eight small cruisers, here,
built to supply the place of others
which had gone to decay, the utÂ­
most has been done that was possiÂ­ Th
ble with the means we command, in Ph
and by substantially rebuilding our of th
old ships with durable material and hund
completely repairing and refitting indei
our monltars, the fleetof the navy succe
hrs been gradually so broughtdurir
up that though it does not It ha
maintain its relative position among arts
the progressive navies of the world, mad
it is now in a condition more powÂ­ mons
erful and effective thanr it ever has behic
been in time of peace. The comÂ­ bran
plete repairs of our five heavy iron. have
clads are only delayed on account of only
the inadequacy of the appropriaÂ­ skill
tions made last year for the working work
bureaus of the department, which gethr
were actually less in amount than our
those madre before thie war, notÂ­ great
withstanding the greatly-enhanced parts
nrices of labor and materials, and enge
thd increase in the cost of the naval by sc
service, growing out of the uniÂ­ nects
versal use and great expense tute,
of steam machinery. The money gove
necessary for these repairs should be the
provided at once that they may be be m
completed without further unnecesÂ­ corm
sary delay and expense. When this hbiit
Is done all the strength that there is this
in the navy will be developed and w
useful to its fullest capacity, and all that
will be powerful for the purpose of the
defense, and also for the offensive wher


arise within a reasonable distance hu d
from our shore; and the fact that tion
our navy is not more modern as n
and powerful than it is has been ment
made a cause of complaint against quest
the secretary of the navy by is ac
persons who at the same time Al
criticise and complain of his enÂ­ ated
deavors to bring the navy that are ticip

of adstnl' ' ""the salariils of postÂ­ ex
masters of the fourth class is necesÂ­ tt
eary for the good of'the service, as co
well as for the interestsof the govÂ­ t.i
erement, and urgently recommends na
that the compensation of. the class til
of postmasters above mentioned be p1
based upon the business of their of
respective offices, as ascertained M
from the sworn returns to the tri
auditor of the stamps! cancelled. St
A few, postmasters lathe southern pe
states have, expressed great appreÂ­ pr
henslons of their personal safety on osi
:account of their connection with the of
postal service,.and have specially suj
requested that their reports of apÂ­ to
prehended danger should not be
made public lest it should result in be
the loss of their lives; but no posiÂ­ ces
'tive testimony of interference has al
been submitted except in the in
case of a mail messenger at SparÂ­ pr
tansburg' in South Carolina who te
reported that he had been violently rea
driven away while in charge on ele
account of his political afBliÂ­ TI
atlons. An assistant superintendÂ­ en
ent of the railway mall service pu
investigated this case, and reported an
that the messenger had disappeared car
from his pobt, leaving his work to lan
be performed by a substitute. The we
postmaster-general thinks this case we
Is sufficiently suggestive to justify ev
him in recommending that a more we
severe punishment should be proÂ­ ex
vided for the offense of assaulting up
any person in charge of the mails, cot
orof rea rding or otherwise obstructÂ­ ecd
ing them by threats of personal inÂ­ we
jury. A very gratifying result is preÂ­ edj
sented in the fact that a deficiency of res
this department during the last If
fiscal year was reduced in
to $408,179,018 as against kn
$616,993 888 of the preceding yearÂ­ stu
The difference can be traced to a on
large increase in its ordinary reÂ­ not
ceipts, which greatly exceeded the ms
estimates therefor, and a slight deÂ­ the
crease in its expenditures. The .,rÂ­
dinary receipts of the postoffice I
department for the past seven fiscal vet
years have increased at an average mi
of over eight per cent. per annum, on
while the increase of expenditures dui
for the same period has been about Tii
five and a half per cent. per annum, th
and the decrease of deficiency in the ha
revenues has been at the. rate I
of nearly two per cent. per annum. no

of agriculture accompanying this p0)

interest, marking as it does the ott

in the labor of producing, saving do,

This report; by those interested ma
in agriculture and deriving their ex(
support from it, will be found of dy
value, in pointing out those articles fru
which are raised in greater quantity fiv
than the needs of theworld require, Cul
and must sell therefore for less than St'
the cost of production, and those exl
which command a profit over the sari
cost of producing because there is all
not an over-production. I call special tio
attention to the need of the departÂ­ fat
ment for a new gallery, for the rÂ­ the
ception of the exhibits returned shi
from the centennial exhibition, inÂ­ riv
eluding the exhibits donated by by
very many foreign nations, and to its
the recommendations of the coinÂ­ the
missioner of agriculture generally. cl

CENTENNIAL EXIBITION,
The international exhibition held cot
in Philadelphia, this year, in honor the
of the commencement of the one
hundredth anniversary of American shi
independence, has proven a great on
success, and will no doubt be of enÂ­ we
during advantage to the country. st
It has shown great progress in the fro
arts, sciences and mechanical skill, thl
made in a single century and deÂ­
monstrated that we are but a little
behind the older nations in one ble
branch, while In some we scarcely tlc
have a rival. It has served too, not agi
only to bring people and products of of
skill and labor tram all parts of the ac
world together, but n bringing toÂ­ ins
gether people from all sections of pr
our country, which must prove a a m
great benefit in the information imÂ­ a
parted, anl the pride of country liu
engendered. It has been suggested
by scientists interested in and conÂ­ in
nected with the Smithsonian instiÂ­
tute, in a communication, that the f
government exhibit be removed to Tb
the capital, and a suitable building com
be erected or purchased for its acÂ­
conmmodation, as a permanent exÂ­ eni
hibition. I earnestly recommend at
this and believing that cnmgrcss I1
wnoud second this view, I directed n
that all government exhibits at let
the centennial should remain. TI

hulld'ng not intended as a proteeÂ­ tie
tion to inclement weather, or such 11,
as may be wanted by the departÂ­ the
ment furnishing them, until the col
question of a permanent exhibition ref
is acted on. R
Although the moneys ap propriÂ­ goi
ated by congress to enable the parÂ­ slh
ticipation of the several executive ini
departments in the international no
exhibition of 1876 were not sufficient ter
to carry out the undertaking to the ma
full extent at first contemplated, it his
gives me pleasure to refer to the on
very efficient and creditable manner I d
in which the board appointed from sa
theseseveral departments to provide th
an exhibition on the part of the fer
government, have discharged their aci
duties with the funds placed at their
command-without a precedent to fic




 a
guide them in the preparation of abl
such a display-the success of their agi
labors was amply attested by the fur
sustained attention which the pul
contents of the government buildÂ­ est
ing attracted during the period of pre
the exhibition, from both forelgn
f
and native people. I am strongly
Impressed with the value of the colÂ­ 187
letion made by the governÂ­ -
m nt, for the purposes of the
exhibition, illustrating as It does
the. general resources of the
country, the statistical and pracÂ­
tical evidences of our growth as a
nation, and the basis of the mercanÂ­
tile arts and the applications of apÂ­
plied science in the administration meo
of the affairs of the government.
Many nations have voluntarily conÂ­ F
tributed their exhibits to the United stre
States to increase the interest in any
permanenteexhibition congress may D
provide for. For this act of generÂ­ omic
osity they should receive the thanks in a
of the people, and I respectfully
suggest that a resolution of-congress
to that effect be adopted.
The attention of congress cannot
be too earnestly called to the neÂ­
cessity of throwing some greater
safeguard over the method of choosÂ­ MA
ingand declaring the election of a reps
president. Under the present sysÂ­
tem there seems to be no provided LEI
remedy for contesting the .
election in any one state. and
The remedy is partially, no doubt, t*
enlightenment of electors. The comÂ­
pulsory support of the free school,
and the disfranchisement of all who
cannot read and write the English
language, after fixed probation
would meet my hearty approval. I
-
would not make this apply, howÂ­
ever to those already voters, but I ent
would to all becoming so after the wi1
expiration of the probation fixed Real
upon. Foreigners coming to this
country to become citizens, whq are
educated in their own angugeW.
would acquire the requisite knowlÂ­
edge of ours during the necessary B
residence to obtain naturalization.
If they did not take enough interest
in our language to acquire sufficient f
knowledge of it to enable them to
study the institutions and laws of
our country intelligently, I would
not confer upon them the right to
make and enact laws nor to select
those who do.
MISCELLANEOUS.
I append to the message, for conÂ­
venient reference, a synopsis of adÂ­
ministrative events and of all recÂ­ Gi
ommendations to congress by me
during the last seven years.
Time may show some of
those recommendations not to
have been wisely conceived, but r
I believe the larger part will be
no discredit to the administration.
One of these recommendations met LIT
with the united opposition of one
political party in the senate, and
with a strong opposition from the
other, namely: the treaty for the
annexation of Santo Domingo to the
United States, to which I shall
especially refer, maintaining, as I
do, that if my views had been conÂ­ Dite
curred in the country would be in a
more prosperous condition to-day,
both politically and financially.
Santo Domintgo is fertile, and
upon its soil may be grown
just those tropical products
of which the United States
use so much, and which Mad
are produced or prepared for A
market now by slave labor almost
exclusively, namely: sugar, coffee,
dye woods, mahogany, tropical
fruits, tobacco, etc. About seventyÂ­
five per cent. of the exports of
Cuba are consumed in the United
States. A large percentage of the
exports of Brazil also filu the
same market. These are paid for
almost exclusively in coin legislaÂ­
tion, particularly in Cuba, being unÂ­
favorable to a mutual exchange of
the products of each country. Flour eous
shipped from the .Mississippi res
river to Havana can pass s
by the very entrance to the city on
its way to a port of Spain, and
then paysaduty fixed upon artiÂ­
cles to be re-exported and transÂ­
ferred to a Spanish vessel and
brought back almost to the point of
starting, paying a second duty, and
still leave at profit over what would
be received by direct shipment. All
that is produced in Cuba could be
produced In Santa Domingo, and
being a part of the United States, Of a
commerce ietween the island and
the mainland would be free; there
would be no export duties on her
shipments, nor import duties
on those coming here; there
would be no import duties upon tile
supplies, machinery, etc. going
from tlle United States. Tio effect St
that would have been produced
upon Cuban commerce, with these
advantages to America is observaÂ­
ble at a glance. The Cubain quesÂ­
tion would have been settled long nQm
ago, in favor of free Cuba; hundreds
of American vessels would now be
advantageously used in transportÂ­
ing the valuable goods and other
products of the soil of the island to
a market, and in carrying supplies
and emigrants to it. The island is fol
but sparsely settled,while it has an
are sufficient for the production and v
employment of several millions of
eople, the soil would have soon

The products are so valuable inl
commerce that emigration there
would have been encouraged; tile We
emnancipated race of the south
would halve found there a congenial
home, where their civil rights could
not be disputed, and where their P
labor would be nluch sought after.
The poorest among them could
have found means to ~o there. In


ties, such as have been pnrticed
upon them in many places within
the last eleven years, the whole
communities would have sought Li
refllge in ~n D)omingo. I do not
sl uppose the. whole. race would have
gone, nor is it desirable that. they LE
should go. Their labor is desirable,
indispensable alnmot, where they
now are, but the possession of this rÂ­
territory would have left the negro
master of the situation by enabling
him to demand his rights at home Ilre,
on pain of securing them elsewhere. Gall
I do not present these views now as de
a recommendation for a renewal of
P -
the subject of annexation, but 1 reÂ­
fer to it to vindicate my previous
action in regard to it. mincr
With the present congress my ofÂ­
flial life terminates. It Is not prob. 20

the remedy due. This course necessarily recomÂ­
mended itself from the outset to the executive,
for only in the lk'ht of a dispassionately ascerÂ­
tained certainty could it determine the nature
and measure of its full duty in the matter. The
visual procedure was followed, as in all -eases of
casualty or disaster t national vessels of any
maritime state. A naval court of inquiry was
si once organized, composed of officers well
jualified by rank and practical ex
perience to discharge the onerous
duty imposed upon them. Aided
by a strong force of wrev:ers and divers, the
court proceeded to mike a thorough investhraÂ­
tfvin on Che spot, emploving every available
means for the impartial and exact determinaÂ­
tion of the cause of the explosion Its operaÂ­
tions have been conducted with the utmost deÂ­
liberation ami judgment, and. while indepenÂ­
dently pursued, no source of information was
neglected, and the fullest opportunity was alÂ­
lowed for a simultaneous investigation by the
Spanish authorities.
The finding of the court xf inquiry was
reached, after twenty-three days of continuous
labor, (i the 21st of March, instant, and having
been approved en the Sid by thecommander-in-chief
of the United States naval foil on the
North Atlantic station, was transmitted to the
executive.
It is herewith laid before the con press to-day
with the voiumin ms testimony taken before
the court. Its purport is. in brief, as follows:
When the Maine arrived at Havana she was
conducted by the regular government pilot to
buoy No. 4. to which she was moored in from
five and one-half to six fathoms of water. The
state of discipline on board and the condition
of her magazines, boilers, coal bunkers and
storage compartments are passed in review,
with the conclusion that excellent order preÂ­
vailed, and that n i in.'.ication of any cause for
a.u internal explosion existed in any quarter.
At eiht o'clock in the evening of February
15 everything had been reported secure and all
tkas quiet.
At forty minutes past nine o'clock the vessel
was suddenly destroyei
There were two distinct explosions, with a
t-rif f interval between them. The first lifted
the forward part of the ship very perceptibly:
the scc n 1. which was more prolonged, is atÂ­
tributed by the count) the partial explosion of
two or more of the forward magzinv
The e i ience of the divers establishes that
the after part of the ship was practically intact
and sank in that cor. lit ion a very few minutes
fter tlv x lesii u. The forward part was
temp'ett ly demolished.
I"" pon e id n.e of concurrent external cause
the finding of the court is as follows:
At frame IT the outer shell of the ship from
a point eleven r.ni oue-haif feet frv.ni the midÂ­
de line of the ship and six feet above the keel,
wht n in its normal position, has been forced up
so as to be now about lour feet alove the surÂ­
face of ths water: therefore, aoout thirty-four
leet above where it would be had the ship sunk
uninjured.
The outside bottom plating is bent into a
rtrver.seJ ""V"" shape, the after wing of which,
about fifteen feet broad and thirty-two feet in

len;?t- (froai frame 17 to frame 25). is doubled

back upon itself against the continuation of the
lime platintr extending forward.
At frame 1H the vertical keel is broken in two
and the keel bent into an angle simailr to the
anjcle formed for thi outside plates. This
break Is about six feet below the surface of the
water and abut thirty feet above its normal
position.
In the opinion of the court this effect could
have been proJuced only by the explosion of a
mine situated under the bottom of the ship at
about frame 18. and somewhat on the port side
of the ship.
The conclusions of the court are:
That the loss of the Maine was not in any reÂ­
spect due to fault or negligence on the part of
any of the officers or members of her crew.
That the ship was destroyed by the explosion
of a submarine mine, which caused the partial
explosion of two or more of her forward magaÂ­
zines; and.
That no evidence has been obtainable fixing
the responsibility for the destruction of the
Maine upon any person or persons.
I have directed that the finding of the court
of inquiry and the views of this government
thereon be communicated to the government of
her majesty, the queen, and I do not perm t
myself to doubt that the sense of justice of the
Spanish nation will dictate a course of action
suggested by honor and the friendly relations of
the two governments.
It was the duty of the executive to advise the
congress of the result, and in the meantime deÂ­
liberate consideration is Invoked.

Report of the Court of Inquiry.
The following' is the full text of the
report of the eourt of inquiry:
V. S. S. Iowa. First Rath. I
Key West. Fla.. V
Mosuat, March 21, li&
After full and mature consideration of all the
testimony before it. the court finds as follows:
1. That the United States battleship Maine
arrived in the harbor of Havana, Cuba, on the
twenty-fifth day of January. 198. and was taken
to buoy No. 4. in from five and a half It six
fathoms of water, by the regular government
pilot.
The United States consul general at Havana
had noi Hied the authorities at that place, the
previous evening, of the intended arrival of the
Maine.
The state of discipline on bo ir.l fie Maine
was excellent: and all orders and regulations in
regard to the care and safety of the ship were
strictly carried out.
All ammunition was siowed away in accord
ance with instructions, nnd proper care was
taken whenever ammunition was handled.
Nothing was stowed in any one of the maga
zines or shell rooms which was not i crmitted
to be stowed there.
The magazines and shell-rooms were always
locked after having been opened; and after the
destruction of the Maine the keys were found in
their proper place in the captain's cabin, everyÂ­
thing having been reported secure that evening
at 8 p. m.
The temperatures of the magazines and shell-
rooms were taken daily and reported. The only
magazine which had an undue amount cf heat
was the after ten-inch magazine, and that did
not explode at th3 time the Maine was deÂ­
stroyed.The torpedo warheads were all stowed in the
after part of the ship, under the wan! room, and
neither caused nor participated in the destrucÂ­
tion of the Maine.
The dry gun cotton primers ami detonatcrs
were stowed in the cabin oft, and remote from
the scene of tha explosion.
The waste was carefully looked afteron board
the Maine to obviate danger. Special orders in
regard to this had been given by the commandÂ­
ing officer.
Varnishes, dryers, alcohol and other com
bustible! of this naterc were stowed on or
above the main deck, and could not have had
anything to do with th3 destruction of the
Maine.
The medical stores were stowed aft under the
ward room, and remote from the scene of the
explosion.
No dangerous stores of any kind were stowed
below in any of tha other ster: rooms.
The coal bunkers were inspected. Of those
bunkers adjoining the forward magazines and
shell rooms, four were empty, namely, 113. 1U,
m. b&
A IS had leen in use that day. and A 16 was
full of Njw Kiver coaL This coul had been
ciirefully inspected before receiving it on board.
The bunker in which it wasstow;d was accessiÂ­
ble on three sides at al' times, and the fourth
side at this time, on account of bunkers lit and
I!6 being empty. This bunker AI6. had been
luspecieu mat uay oy tne engineer officer on
duty.
The fire alarms in the bunkers were in work
Ing order, and there hu never been a case of
spontaneous combustion of coal on board the
Maine.
Ths two after loilers of the ship were in use
at the time of the disaster, but for auxiliary
purposes only, with a comparatively low presÂ­
sure of steam, and being tended by a reliable
Watch.
CAPT. SAMPSON. OF THE IOWA,
President of the Court of Inquiry.
These boilers could not have caused the exÂ­
plosion of the ship. The four forward boilers
have since been found by the divers, and are in
a fair condition.
On the night of the destruction of the Maine
everything had been reported secure for the
night at 8 p. m.. by reliable persons, through
the proper authorities, to the commanding offi
cer. At the time tie Maine was destroyed the
ship was quiet aad, therefore, least liable to
accident caused by movements from those on
board.
EXPLOSIONS.
3. The destruction of the Maine occurred at
9:40 p.m.. oa the fifteenth div of February.
189.S. in the harbor of Havana, Cuba, being at the
time moored at the same buoy to which she had
been taken upon her arrival.
There were two explosions of a distinctly
different character, with a very short but dis
tinct interval between them, and the forward
part of the ship was lifted to a marked degree at
the time of the first explosion.
The first explosion was more in the nature of
a report like that of a gun: while the second
explosion was more open. prolon,'5d. and of
greater volume. This seeond explosion was. in
the opinion of the court, caused by the partial
explsion of two or more of the forward maga
zines of the Maine.
condition or toe wreck.
4. The evidence bearing on this, being prin
cipally obtained from divers, did not enable the
court to form a definite conclusion as to the
condition of the wreck, although it was estab
lished that the after part or the ship was pracÂ­
tically intact, and sank in that condition a very
few minutes after thi Oeuruetion of the forÂ­
ward part.
The following facts in regard to the forward
part of th? ship are, however, established b
the testimony:
The portion of the p-rt side of the protectiv;
deck, which extends from about frame 30 to
about frame 41. was blown up aft. and over to
port. The main deck from about frame 3) tr
about frame 41. was blown up aft. and slightly
over to starboard, folding the forward part of
the middle superstructure over and on top of
the after part.
This was. in the opinion of the court, caused
by tho partial explosion of two or mare of the
forward magazines of the Maine.
i. At frame 17 the outer shell of the shin.
from a poiat eleven and one-half feet from the

i i imJm ill

middle line of the ship, and six feet above the

keel, when in its normal position, has been
forced up so as to be now about four feet above
the surface of the water; therefore about thir
ty-four feet above where it would be had the
ship sunk uninjured. The outside bottom
plating Is bent into a reversed V shape, the
after win of which, about fifteen feet broad
and thirty-two feet in length (from frame 17 to
frame 2o). is doubled back upon itself against
the continuation of the same plating extending
forward.
At frame 19 the-vertical keel is broken In two
and the flat keel bent into an angle similar to
the angle formed by the outside bottom plating.
Toe break is now about six feet below the sur
face of the water and about thirty feet above
its normal position.
In the opinion of the court, this effect could
have been produced only by the explosion of
mine situated under the bottom of the ship at
about frame 18, and somewhat on the port side
of the ship.
ft. The court finds that the loss of the Maine.
on the occasion named, was not in any respect
due to fault or negligence on the part of any of
the officers or members of the crew of said ves
sel.-
7. In the opinion of the court the Maine was
destroyed by the explosion of a submarine mine.
which caused the partial explosion of two or
more of her forward magazines. 2

dence fixing the responsibility for the destruc
Hon I the Maine upon any person or persons.

A Recent Excitement Investigated by the
Herald and the Results
Made Public.
(Cleveland, 0., Herald.)
A lew weeks ago we copied into our colÂ­
umns from the Rochester, N. Y., Democrat
and Chronicle ""A Remarkable Statement.""
made by J. B. Henion, M. D., a gentleman
who is well known in this city. In that artiÂ­
cle Dr. Henion recounted a wonderful experiÂ­
ence which befell him, and a few days thereÂ­
after we publishad from the same paper a secÂ­
ond article, giving an account of the ""ExciteÂ­
ment in Rochester,"" caused by Dr. Henion's
statement. In the first article Dr. Henion
stated that for a number of years, up to last
June, he had been attiicted with what seemed
at first a most mysterious trouble. He felt
unaccountably tired at frequent intervals ; he
had dull and indefinite pains in various parts
of his body and head, and was very hungry
one day and entirely without appetite the
next. However, as a physician he thought,
and so did his fellow physicians, that he was
suffering from malaria. ""
But he grew worse, and was finallv obliged
to give up a large aiyl luerative praeticc. Still
he was not conscious of his danger, nor that a
monstrous disease was becoming fixed upon
him. although all his organs had become
gradually weakened. The symptoms above
described continued, accompanied bv others of
an aggravated nature, and he noticed a peculÂ­
iar color and odor about the fluids he was
passing; that they Mere abundant one day
and very scanty the next, and were covered
with froth or filled with brick-dust sediment.
But even then he did not realize his real and
alarmÃ¯Ã®ig condition. At last, however, he was
brought face to face with the fact that he was
a victim of a most terrible disease, and he
made heroic efforts for recovery. He traveled
extensively and consulted the best physicians,
but they could give him only temporary reÂ­
lief, and that principally in the form of morÂ­
phine. And so he grew steadily and conÂ­
stantly worse until his life became a torture.
His pulse was uncontrollable. He lived
wholly by injections, and for six days and
nights he had the hiccoughs constantly,
wiiich are the sure indication of coming death.
When hope and life were nearly exhausted
his pastor, the Rev. Dr. Foote, rector of St.
Paul's Church, strongly urged him to try a
means which the reverend gentleman had seen
used with remarkable results. He objected at
first, but finally consented, and was conscious
of an improved condition the first week. His
pains gradually disappeared; his stomach reÂ­
sumed digestion; his heart became regular;
his headaches disappeared; he had no more
chills and fever, or acidity of the stomach; he
gained twenty-six pounds in three months,
and is a well man to-day, being entirely cured
of a most pronounced case of Bright' s disease.
Although conscious of the consequences
from his professional brethren, still as a duty
to his fellow men, and according to a vow he
made on what he thought was his dying bed,
he published a card detailing his illness and
remarkable cure. ""Since my recovery."" he
says, ""I have thoroughly reinvestigated the
subject of kidney difficulties and Bright's
disease, and I believe more than one-half
the deaths which occur in A merica arb

caused by B right's disease of the kidÂ­
neys . It has no distinctive symptoms of its
own (indeed, it often develops without any
-ain whatever in the k'dneys or their vicinity,)
ut has the symptoms of nearly Ã§very other
known compiaint. Hundreds of people die
daily whose burials are authorized by a physiÂ­
cian's certificate of ""Heart Disease,"" ""ApoÂ­
plexy."" ""Paralysis,"" ""Spinal Complaint,""
''Rheumatism,"""" ""Pneumnonia,"" and other
common complaints, when in reality it was
Bright's disease of the kidneys. Few physiÂ­
cians, and fewer people, realize the extent of
this disease or its dangerous and insidious naÂ­
ture. It steals into the system like a thief,
manifests its presence by the commonest
symptoms, and ""fastens itself upon the life beÂ­
fore the victim is aware. It is nearly as herÂ­
editary as consumption, quite as co nmon and
fully as fatal. Entire families, inheriting it
from their ancestors, have died, and yet none
of the number knew or realized the mysterious
power which was removing them. Instead of
common symptoms it often shows none whatÂ­
ever, but brings death suddenly, and as such
is usually supposed to be heart disease.
The second article entitled ""Excitement in
Rochester,"" was made up of interviews with
Dr. Henion himself, who confirmed all said in
his card, and also with Mr. II. H. Warner.
The latter gentleman did not regard Dr. HenÂ­
ion's ease as particularly exceptional, because
i he had known of very many such cures by the
same means in all parts of ""the land. Kidney
diseases, he said, are carrying off tens of
thousands every year, while Bright's disease
is increasing 250 per cent, a decade, and yet
the people do not realize it or seek to check it

until too late. He related how a New Orleans
medical professor, lecturing on this disease,
thinking to show his class what healthy fluids
were, subjected some of his own to a chemical
test, and although he had no suspicion of it
before, discovered that he. too, had the dreadÂ­
ed disease, which proved fatal in less than a
year. There was also an interview with the
celebrated chemist of the New York State
Board of Health, Dr. S. A. Lattiinore, who
Slid he had analyzed the remedy which cured
Dr. Henion, and found that it was "" entirely
free from any poisonous or deleterious subÂ­
stances.""
We have made these condensations in order
that all the material facts may be set before
our readers. Since the publication of the-e
two article-, having been besieged with letÂ­
ters of inquiry, we sent a communication to
Dr. Henion and also o;ie to H. H. Warner &
Co., asking if any additional proof could be
given us as to the validity of the statements
published. In answer thereto we have reÂ­
ceived the following letters, which add interÂ­
est to the entire subject and wholly verify
every statement hitherto male:
R ochester , N. Y., Feb. 2. 1SS3.
G entlemen : Your favor is received. The
published statement, over my signature, to
which you refer, is true in every respect, and I
owe my life and present health wholly to the
power of Warner's Safe Kidney and Liver
Cure. It is not surprising that people should
question the statement I made, for my recovÂ­
ery was as great a iuarvel to myself as to my
physicians and friends. * ""* *

S irs : Acknowledging your favor dulv reÂ­
ceived. we would say: The best proof wÃ« can
give you that the statements made by Dr.
Henion are entirely true, and would not have
been published unless strictly so, is the folÂ­
lowing testimonial from the best citizens of
Rochester, and a card published by Rev. Dr.
Foote, which you are at liberty to use if you
wish. II. H. W arner & Co.

To Whom it may Concern:
In the Rochester, N. Y., Democrat and Chron
icle of December 31, 1881, there appeared a
statement in the form of a card from Dr. J. B.
Henion, of this city, recounting his reÂ­
markable recovery from Bright's disease of
the kidneys, after several doctors of promiÂ­
nence had given him up, by the use of a prepÂ­
aration manufactured in this city and known
as Warner's Â£afe Kidney and Liver Cure.
We are personally or by reputation acquaintÂ­
ed with Dr. lienion, and we believe he would
publish no statement uot. literally true. We
are also personally or h j reputation well acÂ­
quainted with H. H. Warner & Co., proprieÂ­
tors of this remedy, whose commercial and
Eersonal standing in this community is of the
ig h est order, and we believe that they would
not publish any statements, which were not
literally and strictly true in every particular.

To the Editor of the Living Church, Chicago, 111.;
Will you allow the following card, personal
to myself, to appear in your widely-circulated
paper?
There was published in the Rochester DemoÂ­
crat and Chronicle of the 31st of December
last, a statement made by J. B. Henion. M.
D., narrating how he had been cured of
Bright's disease of the kidneys, almost in its
last stages, by the use of Warner's Safe KidÂ­
ney and Liver Cure. I was referred to in that
statement as having recommended and urged
Dr. Henion to try the remedy, which he did,
and was cured.
Now the republishing of his statement in
many of the leading journals of the day has
been the cause of an incessant flow of letters
to me making many inquiries, but chiefly
whether the statement is true, or a mere adÂ­
vertising dodge, etc., etc.
I beg, therefore, to anticipate any further
inquiries and save time and labor, and some
postage, by faying that the statement of Dr.
Henion is true, so far as it concerns myself,
and I believe it to be true in all other reÂ­
spects. He is a parishioner of mine and I
visited him in his sickness. I urged him to
take the medicine and would do the same
again to any one who was troubled with a disÂ­
ease of the kidneys and liver.

The Chicago Tribune draws particular atÂ­
tention to a prescription which has been
printed by the Scientific American, which
is said to have proved a practical and effiÂ­
cient remedy for the chronic love of strong
drink. It is described as follows: There
is a prescription in use in England for the
cure of drunkenness, by which thousands
are said to have been assisted in recoverÂ­
ing themselves. The receipt came into
notoriety through the efforts of John Vine
Hall, commander of the f-eat Eastern
steamship. He had fallen into such habit.
ual drunkenness that his most earnest
efforts to reclaim himself proved unavailing.
At length he sought the advice of an emiÂ­
nenr physician, who gave him a prescription
-which he followed seven months, and
at the end of that time had lost all desire
for liquor, although he had for many years
been lead captive--which he afterwards
published, and by which so many drunkards
have been assisted to reform, as follows:
"" Sulphate of iron, 5 grains; peppermint.
Iwater, eleven draehms;s pirit of nutmeg, one
drachm; twice a day."" This preparation
acts as a stimulant and a tonic, and partialÂ­
ly supplies the place of the accustomed
liquor, and prevents that absolute physical
and moral prostration that follows a sudden
breaking off from the use of stimulating
drinks.
We can scarcely conceive, Fays the TriÂ­
bune, that the Scientific American would
have printed this without being satisfied
of its efficiency. We commend it, thereÂ­
fore, to the co ,sideration of our physicians
and druggists. Thero are many men ad
dieted to strong drink, who are worthy
objects of conmmisseration, lost beyond their
own mental and moral powers of recuperÂ­
ation and reform. If there is anything in
the world that can help them out of the
Slough of Despond in which they find
themselves, it is a blessing which ought to

Washington, Jan.. 28.-The President
a to-day sent to Congressa the following
special message on. the financial quesÂ­
tion:
e ""To the Senate and House of' RepreÂ­
""
sentatives: In my last annual message
I commended to the serious'coneoderaÂ­
Stinn of the Congress the condlition of
nour atflonal Ilnances, and in -:conÂ­
nection with the subject endorsed
the plan of currency legislation
which at that time seemed to furÂ­
nish protection against impending'
l
danger. This plan has not been ap=
Sproved by the Congress. In the meanÂ­
time the situation has so changed. and
the emergency now appears so threatÂ­
ening,; that I deem it my duty to ask
at the hands of the legislative branch
of the government such prompt and efÂ­
fectlye action as will restore confidence
in our financial soundness and avert
e business disaster and universal distress
S'among our people.
`Whaitever may be the merits! of the
plan outlined' in my annual' message
nas aremedy for lls then existing, and
as a"" safeguard against the depletion
of the gold reserve then in the TreaÂ­
sury. I am now cOnvinced that its reÂ­
a coption by the Congress land our presÂ­
ent advanced stage of financial perÂ­
Splexty nsecesstales additional or difÂ­
ferent legislation
S ""WÂ·lth natural resourceis unlimited In
v ariety and productive strength, and
with a people whose activity and enterÂ­
prise seek only a fair opportunity to
achieve national success and greatness,
ourpprogress should not be checked by
Safaise
financial policy and a heedless
disregard of sound monetary laws,Â­ nor
should the timidity and fear which they
engender stand in the Way of our prosÂ­
perity. d
' I""t Ism hardly disputed that this preÂ­
dicament confronts us to-day. ThereÂ­
fore, no one 'in any degree responsible
lfor the making and, execution of ouT
laws should fail'to seeoa patriotic duty
in honestly and sincerely attempting to

effort will not succeed unless It is made
untrammelled by the prejudice of parÂ­
I tisanshlp and with a steadfast deterÂ­
rnination to resist the temptation to acÂ­
complish party, advantage.' We may
w waell remember that if we are threatenÂ­
Sed with financial dilficultleso all our

t cerned; and saurely those who suffer

STHE -LACK OF CONFIDENCEI.
""The real trouble which confronts
us consists in a lack of confidence; wideÂ­
Sspread and constantly increasing, in the
- continuing ability or disposition of the
government to pay its obligations In
gold. This tack of confidence grows to
some extent out of the palpable and
Sapparent embarrassment attending the
efforts 'of the government under existÂ­
ing laws ton'ldocure gold, and to a
greater extent opt oft 'the impossibility
of either keeping it in the Treasury or
cancelling obligations by its expendiÂ­
ture after it is obtained.
S""The only'way left open to the govÂ­
ernment for procuring gold is by the
I issue and sale of Its bonds. The only
bonds that can be so issued were auÂ­
tthorized
nearly twenty-five years ago,
and are not well calculated to meet
our present needs. Among other disÂ­
advantages they are made payable In
coin Instead of specifically In gold.
which In existing conditions detracts
i
largely and In an iqereaslng ratio from
their desirability as investments. It is
by no means certain that bonds of this
description can much longer be disposÂ­
ed of at a prlcecreditable to the finanÂ­
clal character of our government. The
most dangerous and Irritating feature
of the situation, however, remains to
be mentioned. It Is found in the means
by which the Treasury is despoiled o;
the gold thus obtained without cancelÂ­
ling a single government obligation, and
solely for the benefit of those who find
profit In shipping it abroad or whose
fears induce them to hoard It at home.
We have outstanding about five hunÂ­
dred millions of currency notes of the I
government, for which gold may-be deÂ­
manded; and, curiously enough, the law I
requires that when presented, and in
fact redeemed, paid In gold, they shall
be reissued.
'Thus the same notes may.do duty
many times In drawing gold from the
Treasury; nor can the process be arÂ­
rested as long as private parties for
profit or otherwise see an advantage in
repeating the operation. More than
three hundred millions of dollars In
these notes have already been redeemed <
In gold, and notwithstanding such reÂ­ I
demptlon they are all still outstanding.
THE BOND I.9SUES.
""Since the 17th day of January, 1894,.
our bonded Interest-bearing debt has
been increased $100.000.000 for the purÂ­
pose of obtaining gold to replenish ourr
coin reserve. Two Issues were made
amounting to fifty millions each-one I
In January and the other in November.
As a result of the first Issue there was I
realized something more than fiftyÂ­
eight millions of dollars In gold. BeÂ­
twten that issue and the succeeding
one in November, comprising a period
of abopt ten months, nearly one hunÂ­
dred and three millions of dollars in
gold were drawn from the Treasury.
This made the second issue necessary,0
and upon'that more than $8,.000,000
In gold was again realized. Between n
the date of this second issue and the
present time, covering a period of only
about two months, more than sixtyÂ­
nine millions of dollars in gold have ti
been drawn from the Treasury. These
large sums of gold were expended withÂ­ a
out any cancellation of government obliÂ­ i
gations or in any permanent way beneÂ­ n
fitling our people or Improving our peÂ­
cuniary situation.
""The financial events of the past year
suggest facts and conditions which
should certainly arrest attention. More
than one hundred and seventy-two mllÂ­ a
lions of dollars In gold hove been drawn p
out of the Treasury during the year
for the purpose of shipment abrolo or i
hoarding at home., While nearly oneI
hundred and three millions of this
amount was drawn out during the first ti
ten months of the year. a sum aggreÂ­
gating more than two-thirds bf that
amount, being about sixty-nine milÂ­
lions, was drawn out during the followÂ­
Ing two months, thus indicating a markÂ­
ed acceleration of the depleting process
with the lapse of time.
""The obligations upon which this gold
has been drawn from the Treasury are B
still outstanding, and are available for
use In repeating the exhausting operaÂ­ el
tion with shorter intervals as our perÂ­ L
plexities accumulate. Conditions are
certainly supervenlng tending to make p

AN ADEQUATE GOLD RESERVE.'
S""'An. adequate gold .reserve is' itn all
clrcumstances absolutely essential to
th4'ppholdlng of our publIc credit and
to the maintenance of our high national
character. Our gold reserve has again
reached sucha stage of' dimlnution as to
requjre its speedy, reiforcelient. The
aggravations that must inevitably folÂ­
low present conditions and methodswill
certainly. lead to misfortune and .lose
not only . to' our natotal ' credit' and

but to those. ofl. ur people who seek

""It'will hardlyt do to say that a simple
dnreaseeof revenue wll. cure our trouÂ­

orhwrongfully acquired, as a basis of
natonsal credit, a necessity In the honÂ­
orabledistharge.of our obligations payÂ­
able in. gold and a badge of solvency.
I do not ulderstand that the reai'friends
of' sliver. deslire' a condition that might
follow Inaction or neglect to appreciate
the meaning ot the present exigency If
It'should result in the entire banishÂ­
ment of gold. from our financial and.
currency arrangements.
S""Besides.. the, Treasury notes, which
certalnly shbould be paid , in gold,
amounting .to neary $500,000,000, there

Shall, the payment of these obligations

.tlonal solvency demands, we should not
destroy.:or.even imperil our ability, to

to.such an extent as Is consistent with

crease of the circulating medium
through the agency of national or State
banks, ssice they can easily be adjusted
to such a scheme. Objection has beent
made to the Issuance of interest-bearing
obligations for. the purpose of retiring
the non-interest-bearlng legal tender
notes.. In-point of fact, however. these
notes have burdened us with a large
load of interest, and it Is still accumuÂ­
lating. The aggregate Interest on the
original issue of bhodo, the proceeds of
which in gold contituted the reserve
for the' payment of these notes, amountÂ­
'ml to $T0,.320,20 on-January 1. 1895, and
the annual.charge for interest on these

these figures are given by way of sugÂ­
gesting that their existence has not
been free from Interest charges, and
that the longer they are outstanding,
judging from the experience of the last
year, the more expensive they will beÂ­

ats! and execution of our international obligaÂ­

ought to possess, without question, all the
reasonable and proper means of maintainÂ­

I regret that it is not in my power to
make known to you an equally satisfactory
conclusion in the case of the Caroline
hoe
steamer, with, the circumstances connectÂ­
of ed with the destruction of which, in DeÂ­
g. cember, 1837, by an aimed force fitted out
in the Province of Upper Canada, you are
already made acquainted. No suchatoneÂ­
,"" ment as was due for the public wrong done
to. the United States by this invasion of her.
t. territory, so wholly irreconeible with her
e, rights as an independent power, has yet
been made. In the view taken by this.
Government, the inquiry whether the vesÂ­
W eel was in the employment of those who
i were prosecuiung
an unauthorized war
against that Province, or was engaged by
the owner in the business of transporting
le passengers to and front Navy Island in
as
hopes of private gain, which was most
ma probably the case, in no degree alters the
t. real question at issue between the twogovÂ­
ernments. This Government can never
Sconcede to any foreign Governinet. the
power, except in a case of the rmost-urgent
r"" and extreme necessity, of invadingits terÂ­
o ritory, either to arrest ilihe persoiisor deÂ­
1.
stroy the property of those who may:have.
violated the municipal laws of such fIreign





G::,ii:;1.:
, or basV disregarded their
oiAgations arising under theÂ­ law of naÂ­ df
tiotis. The territory of the United States i
must be regarded as sacredly secure against is
all such invasions, until they shall voluntaÂ­ is
rily acknowledge their inability to acquit
i
themselves of their duties to others. And
in announcing this sentiment, I do but afÂ­
firm a principle which no nation on earth ti
would be more ready to vindicate, at all tv
hazards, than the peop!e and Government of
of Great Britain. ol
If. upon a full investigation of all the ti
facts, it shall appear that the owner of the to
Caroline was governed by a hostile intent, ct
or had made common cause with those who ai
were in the occupancy of Navy Island,
,
then, so far as he is concerned, there can be
w
no claim to indemnity for the destruction of n
his boat, which this Government would feel
itself bound to prosecute-since lie would B
have acted not only in derogation of the tc
rights of Great Britain, but in clear violaÂ­ S
tion of the laws of the United States; but
that is a question which, however settled, b
in no manner involves the higher considÂ­ ?
oration of'the violation of territorial soveÂ­
reignty and j irisdiction. To recognize it ft
as an admissible practice that each governÂ­ n
Ient, inl its turn, upon any sudden and unÂ­ r;
authorized outbreak, which, on a frontier, t'
the extent of which renders it impossible P
for either to have an efficient force on eveÂ­ tI
ry mile of it, and which out break, thereÂ­
fore, neither may be able to suppress in a o
day, may take vengeance info its own p
hands, and without. even a remonstrance,
and in the absence of'any pressing or overÂ­ w
ruling necessity, may invade the territory t
of the. otlier, would inevitably lead to re. b
suits equally to be deplored by both.
When border collisions come to receive a
the sanction, or to be made on the authoriÂ­ tl
ty of either Government, general war di
must be the inevitable result. While it is ai
the ardent desire of the United States to c
cultivate the relations of peace with all naÂ­ at
tions, and to fulfil all the duties of good
neighbothood.towards those who possess ti
territories adjoining their own, that very g
desire would lead them to deny the -right g
of any foreign power to invade their bounÂ­
dary with an armed force. The corresÂ­
pondence between the two Governments tl
on this subject, will, at a future day of at
your session, be submitted to your considÂ­ t,
eration; and in the mean time, I cannot n
but indulge the hope !hat the British GovÂ­ ti
ernment willsee the propriety of renounÂ­ t
cing, as a rule of future action, the preceÂ­ Lo
dent which has been set in the affair at ti
Schlosser.
I herewith submit the correspondence
which has recently taken place between tl
the American Minister at the Court of St. o
James, MIr. Stevens, and tie Minister of cl
Foreign Affairs of that Government,on the s
right claimed by that Government to visit tL
and detain vessels sailing under the AmerÂ­
ican flag and engaged in prosecuting lawÂ­
a
ful commnerce in the African seas. Our n
commercial interests in that region have tl
experienced considerable increase, and o
have become an object of much importance, p
and it is the duty of this government to ti
protect them against all improper and vexÂ­ a
atious interruption. Howeverdesirousthe c
United States may be for the suppression re
of the slave trade, they, cannot consent to
interpolations into thie maratime code, at
the mere will and pleasure of other gov i
ernments. We deny the right of any such t
interpolation to any one, or all the nations
a
of the Earth, without our consent. We
claim to have a voice in all atendments'or p
""alterations of that code-and When we are e
girven to undeista dj, as in _this_ instance,
:by.a foreign Government, that its treaties t
with other nations cannot be executed i
without the establishment and enforcement
of new principlesof maratime police, tobe
applied without our consent, we muist emÂ­
ploy a language neilher of equivocal imÂ­
port, or susceptible of misconstruction.
American citizens prosecuting a lawful
commerce in the African seas, under the I
flag of their country, are not responsible
foIbr the abuse or utnlawfnl use of that flag
by otlhete; nor can they 'iifighlfuly on acÂ­
count of any nuch alleged abuses, be interÂ­
rttpted, molested or ldetainedi while on the
ocean; and if thus molested and idetlained,
while pursuing honest voyages, in the t
usual way, andi viola;ing no law thenmselves,
they are uinquestionably entitled to indemnÂ­
nity. This Government has manifesteed
its repuIgnaneee to ite slaV ItraIe, in
a


mianoer wrucn cannot o nmlsunuersloou. 1
By its fundamental law, it prescribed limÂ­ a
its in point of time to its continuance; and
against its own citizens; who might so far
forget the rights of humanity as to engage
in that wicked traffic, it has long since, by
jts municipal laws, denounced the most
condign punishment.
Many of the States composing thisUnion,
had made appeals to the civilized world for
its suppression, long before the moral sense
of other nations had become shocked by
the' iniquities of the traffic. Whether this
Governmrnt should. now enter into treaties
containing mutual stipulations upon this
subject, is a question bor its mature deliberÂ­
ation. Certain it is, that if the right to deÂ­
tain American ships on the high seas can
be justified oti the plea of a necessity for
such detention, arising out of the existence
of treaties between other nations, the samiie
plea nmav be extended and enlarged by the
new stipulations of new treaties, to which
the United States may not bte a party.
This Government will not cease to urge upon
that of Great Britain, full and ample remuneraÂ­
tion for all losses, whether arising from detenÂ­
tion or otherwise, 'to Which American citizens
have heretofore been, or may liereafter.be subÂ­
jected, by 'tie exer,.ise of rights which this GovÂ­
ernment cannot recognise as..legitimate and
proper. Nor will I indulge a doubt but that the
sense of justice of Great Britain will constrain
her to make retribution for any wrong, or loss, I
which any American citizen, 'engaged in the
prosecution of lawful commerce, may have exÂ­
perienced at the hand of her cruisers, or other
public. authorities. This government, at the
same time, will. relax no effort to prevent its
citizens, if there be any so disposed, from proseÂ­
eating a traffic so revolting to the feelings of
humanity. It seeks to do no more than to pro.
teet the fair and honest trader, from molestation
and injury; but while the enterprising mariner,
engaged in the pursuit of an honorable trade, is
entitled to its protection, it will visit with conÂ­
dign punishment, others of an opposite characÂ­
ter.
Iinvite your attention to existing laws for the
suppression of the African slave-trade, and recomÂ­
mend all such alterations,as may give to them greater
fdrceandefficacy. That the American.flag tsgrossÂ­
ly abused by the abandoned and profligate of: other
nations, is but.too. probable. Congress has, not,
long since, had this subject under its consideration,
and its importance well justifies renewed and anxÂ­
ions attention.
Ialso communicate herewith the copy of a corÂ­
respondence between Mr. Stevenson and Lord PalÂ­
merston, upon the subject so interesting to several
of the Southern States, of the rice duties, which reÂ­
sulted honorably to the justice of Great Britain,and
advantageously to the Utiited:States.
At the opening of the tst an nual session, the PresÂ­
ident informed Uongresaof the progress which had
then been made i negotiating a convention between
this Governmeut and that of England, with a view
to the final settlement of the'question of the bounÂ­
dary between the territorial limits of the two counÂ­
tries. I regret to say, that little further advanceÂ­
ment oftheobject has ben. accomplished since last
year; but this is owing to circumstances no way inÂ­
dicativeof'any abatement of the'desire of both parÂ­
ties to hasten the negotiation to its conclusion, and
Sto.settle';the qunetionn dispute, as early as possible.
In-the'courseof-the sessin, it.is my hope to be able
to announce some further degtee of'progress, to.
Wards the accomplishment of. the higujy desitable
end.

 The commission appointed by this. Government r,
for the exploration and survey of the line of bounÂ­ d
dary separating the States of Maine and New
Hdampshire front the can terminous British Provinces
is, it is believed, about to close its field labors, and '
is expected sobon to report the results of its examiÂ­
nations to the Department of State. The report, I
when received, will be laid before Congress. n
The failure on the part of Spain to pay, with
punctuality, the interest due under the Conven n
tion of 1834, for the settlement of claims beÂ­ c
tween the two countries, has made it the duty -
of the Executive to call the particular attention h
of that Government to the subject. A disliosiÂ­ ti
tion has been manifested by it, which is believed sI
to be entirely sincere, to fulfil its obligations, in P
this respect, so soonas its internal condition, tI
and the state of its finances will permit. An n
arrangement is in progress, from the result of a
which, it is trusted, that those of our citizens ""
who have claims under this convention, will, at i
no distant day, receive the stipulated payments. t
A treaty of commerce and navigation with t
Belgium was concluded and signed at WashingÂ­ a
ton on the 29th of March 1840, and was duly It
sanctioned by the Senate of the United States. P
The treaty was ratified by his Belgion Majesty,
but did not receive the approbation of the BelÂ­ t
gian Chasinbers within the time limited by its c
terms, and has, therefore, become void. P
This occurrence assumes the graver aspect I
from the consideration that, in 1833, a treaty
c
negotiated between the two Governments, and il
ratified on the part of the United States, failed r
to be ratified on the part of Belgium. The u
Representative of that Government at WashingÂ­ c
ton, informs the Department of State, that lie
has been instructed to give explanations of the I
causes which occasioned delay in the'approval 9
of the late treaty by the Legislature, and to exÂ­
press the regret of the King at the occurrence.
The joint commission under the convention
ivith Texas, to ascertain the true boundary be. a
tween the two countries, has concluded its laÂ­ d
bors; but the final report of the commissioners n
of the United States has not been received. It S
is understood, however, that the meridian line, p
as traced by the commission, lies somewhat furÂ­ n
ther cast than the position hitherto generally as.
signed to it, and, consequently, includes in TexÂ­ g
as, some part of the territory which had been
considered as belonging to the States of Louisi. c
ana and Arkansas. g
The United States cannot but take a deep inÂ­ 1
terest in whatever relates to this young, but t
growing Republic. Settled principally by cmiÂ­ P
grants from the United States, we have the hapÂ­
piness to know, that the great principles of civil
liberty are there destined to flourish, under wise v
institutions and wholesome laws: and that, ti
through its example, another evidence is to be 11
afforded of the capacity of popular institutions, e
to advance the prosperity, happiness and permaÂ­ G
nent glory of the human race. The great truth, C
that government was made for the people,and not c
the people for government, has altready been es b
tablished in the practice and by the example of
a
these United States; and we can do no other d
than contemplate its further exemplification by a
a sister Republic, with the deepest interest. ti
Our relations with the independeut States of ii
Sthis hemisphere, formerly under the dominion
of Spain, have not undergone any material t'
change within the past year. The incessant a
sanguinary conflicts in, or between those counÂ­ S
tries, are to be greatly deplored, as necessarily c
tending to disable them from performing their r
duties as members of the community of nations, P
and rising to the destiny which the position and -c
natural resources of many of them might lead a
them justly to anticipate, as constantly giving n
I occasion, also, directly or indirectly, to comÂ­ t
plaints on the part of our citizens who resort d
thither for purposes of commercial Intercourse, a
and as a retarding reparation for wrongs already t
committed, some of which are by no means of 1
recent date. t
The failure of the Congress of Ecuador to hold
a session, at the time appointed for that purpose,
in January last, will probably render abortive a
treaty of commerce with that Rebublic, vithich
was signed at Quito on the 13th of June, 1839,
and had been duly ratified on our part, but
v
which required the approbation of that body,
r
prior to its ratification by the Ecuadorian ExÂ­
ecutive.

t
The claims of our citizens against the BrazilÂ­ a
_ ian government, originating from captures, and t
other causes, are still unsatisfied. The United
States have, however, so uniformly shown a disÂ­
Sposition to cultivate relations of amity with that
V
Empire, that it is hoped the unequivocal tokens I
e
of. the same spirit towards us, lwhich aot adjustÂ­

, paign was resolved upon, as the best mode 1
- of bringing it to a close. Our brave offiÂ­

a
that service, have suffered toils and privaÂ­


tto10ns, ant XtllDItedil an energy, wmi!o, Il
. any other war, would have won for them
ud
nfading laurels. In despite of the sickÂ­
r ness incident to the climate, they have
e penetrated the fastnesses of the Indians,
broken up their encampments, and har.
rassed.them unceasingly. Numbers have
been captured, and still greater numbers
have surrendered, andi have been transÂ­
r ported to join their brethren on the lands
elsewhere alhotted to them by the GovernÂ­
tnent,-and a strong hope is entertained
that, under the conduct of the gallant offiÂ­
cer at the head of the troops in. Florida,
that troublesome and expensive war is desÂ­
r: tined to a speedy termination. With all
the other Indian tribes, we are enjoying
a the blessings of peace. Our duty, as well
r as our best interests, prompt us to observe,
in all ourintercourse with them, fidelity in
fulfilling our engagements, the practice of
o strict justice, as well as the constant exÂ­

The Government, under which it is our happiÂ­ m
ness to live, owes its existence to the spirit of m
compromise which prevailed among its framers of
-jarring and discordant opinions could only of
have beeon reconciled by that noble spirit of paÂ­ CO
triotism, which prompted conciliation, and re. t
suited in harmony. In the same spirit the comÂ­ sh
promise bill, as it is commonly called, was adopÂ­ th
ted at the session of 1833. While the people of th
no portion of the Union will ever hesitate to pay at
all necessary taxes for the support of Govern or
ment, yet an innate repugnance exists, to the pr
imposition of burthens not really necessary for th
that object. In imposing duties, however, for sil
the purposes of revenue, a right to discrimiriate CS
as to the articles on which the duty shall be tb
laid, as well as the amount,necessarily and most t,
properly exists. ba
Ctherwise the Government would be placed in ru
the condition of having to levy the same duties upÂ­ m
s on all articles, the productive, as well as the unoÂ­ 1
productive. The slightest duty upon some, might E'
h:!re the effect of causing their importation to di
cease, whereas others entering extensively into the th
consumption of the country, might bear the heav.
d
iest, without any sensible diminution in theaÂ­ it
d mount imported. So also the Government may be 1o'
c
ujstified in so discriminating, by reference to other a
considerations of domestic policy connected with fu
e our manufactures. So fong as the duties shall be 10
c
laid with distinct reference to the wants of the in
I Treasury, no well founded objection can exist aÂ­ St
gainst them. It might be esteemed desirable that ill
no such augmentation of the taxes should .take no
.placeas would have theeffect of ansnullifig'the lafid 1s
' proceeds distribution act of the last session, which t'
act is declared to be inoperative the moment the gt
duties are increased beyond 20 per cent.: the maxiÂ­ ba
s mum rate established by the Compromise act.Â­ It.
tSome of the provisions of the compromise act, la
which will go into effect on the 30th day of June to
next, may, however, be found exceedingly inconÂ­ OP
venient in practice, under any regulations that ConÂ­ us
gress may adopt. I refer more particularly to that nc
relating to the home valuation. A difference in ph
value of the same articles to some extent, will, neÂ­ er
cessarily, exist at different ports-but that is altoÂ­ of
gether insignificant, when compared with the conÂ­ pe
flicts in valuation; which are likely to arise, from of
the differences of opinion among the numerous apÂ­ m
praisers of merchandize. In many instances the to
estimates of value must be conjectural, and thus ti(
as many different rates of value may be establishÂ­
ed as there are appraisers. These differences in at
c
valuation may also be increased by the inclinaÂ­ pa
tion, which, without the slightest imputation on nc
e their honesty, may arise on the part of the appraisÂ­ fu
ers in favor of their respective ports of entry. I reÂ­ to
commend this whole subject to the consideration of of
Congress, with a single additional remark. CerÂ­ gc
tainty and permanency in any system of governÂ­ in
mental policy are, in all respects, eminently desiraÂ­ T
ble, but more particularly is this true in all that er
affects trade and commerce, the operations of which at
depend much more on the certainty of their returns, 01
and calculations which embrace distant periods of re
time, than on high bounties, or duties, which are tic
f liable to constant fluctuations. to
At your late session, I invited your attention i m
to the condition of the currency and exchanges, gt
and urged the necessity of adopting such meaÂ­
sures as were consistent with the constitutional iv
competency of the Government, in order to corÂ­ at
r rect the unsoundness of the one, and as far as ai
practicable the inequalities of the other. No ai
S-couutry can be in the enjoyment of its full meaÂ­ S
sure of prosperity, without the presence of a p
medium of exchange, approximating to uniformiÂ­ c,
ty of value. What is necessary as between the st
different nations of the earth, is also important it
as between the inhabitants of different parts of v.
the same country; with the first the precious li
,f
metals constitute the chief medium of citculaÂ­ p
tion, and such also would be the case as to the a
d last, but for inventions comparatively modern, '1
which have furnished, in place of gold and silver, b
a paper circulation. I do not propose to enter B
into a eomparative analysis of the merits of the c,
two systems. Such belonged more properly to ti
t the period of the introduction of the paper sys. y
tom. The speculative philosopher might find L
indu:ements to prosecute the inquiry, but his $
researchbs could only lead him to conclude, that
Jthe pa ora yztom-hard-ftrrtably better never been ii
introduced,' and that society might have been d
much happier without it. ti
Td he praetical statesman has a very different tl
task to perform. He has to -look at things as e
they are-to take them-to supply deficiences, o
and to prune excesses as far as in him lies. The ri
d task of furnishing a corrective for derangements s,
d of the paper medium with us, is almost inexpres. a
sÂ­ ibly great. The power exerted by the States ii
It to charter banking corporations, and which, si
S having been carried to a great excess, has filled d
Sthe country with, in most of the States, an irreÂ­ v
deemable paper medium, is an evil which, in d
some way or another, requires a corrective. Tihe p
Srates at which bills of exchange :are negotiated
t between different parts of the country, furnish a
an index of the value of the local substitute for a
gold and silver, which is, in many parts, so far
depreciated, as not to be received, except at a
Slarre discount, in payment of debts, or in the
purchase of produce. It could earnestly be deÂ­ j
0 sired that every batik, not possessing the means a
- of resamption, should follow the esxampte of S


n ta Itare unitea otistes nant 01 ltennsyianla, g

and go into liquidation, rather than by refusing a
to do so to continue embarrassments in the way d
.e
of solvent institutions, thereby augmenting the a
difficulties incident to the present condition of Q
, things Whether this Government, with due s
r' regard to the rights of the States, has any powÂ­ f
re
or to constrain the banks, cither to resume speÂ­ I
s :ie payments, or to force them into liquidation, h
sÂ­
is an inquiry which will not fail to claim your a
is
consideration. In view of the great advantages v
1Â­ which are allowed the corporators, not among t
, the least of which is the authority contained in r
the most of their charters, to make loans to three c
times the amount of their capital, thereby often s
, deriving three times as much interest on the t
same amount of money as any individual is perÂ­
ill
mitted by law to receive, no suffic.ient apology r
ig
can be urged for a long continued suspension of
tIl
specie payments.-Such suspension is producÂ­
e, tive of the greatest detriment to the public, c
i
by expelling from circulation the precious met-,
of als, and seriously hazarding the success of any
effort that this Government can mwihc, to inÂ­ I
xÂ­ crease commercial facilities, and to advance the
'.
public interest.
lÂ­
This is the more to be regrettted, and the indisÂ­
e, pensable necessity for a sound currency becomes the
n_
more manifest, whenwe reflect on the vast amount
of the internal commerce of the country. Of this
we have no statistics, nor just data for forming adeÂ­
[ie
quate opinions. But there can be no dout, but that
of the amout of transportation coastwise, by sea, and
oi the transportation inland by railroads and canals,
and by steamboats and other modes of conveyance,
over the surface of our vast rivers and immense
trt
lakes, and the value of property carried and interÂ­
k. changed by these means,[form agieneral aggregate, to
IÂ­ which the foreign commerce ot the country, large
as it is, makes but a distant approach.
In the absence of any controlling power over this
subj'ct, which by forcing a general resumption of
rid
specie payments would at once have the eflect of reÂ­
21 storing a sound medium of exchange, and would
leave to the country but little to desire, what measÂ­
ure of relief, falling within the limits of ourconstiÂ­
e tutional competency, does i. become this GovernÂ­
nÂ­ ment to adopt? It was my painful duty at your
Ite last session, under the weight of most solemn obliÂ­
sa
gations, to differ with Congress on the measures
which it proposed for my approval, anid which it
he oubtless regarded as corrective of-.existing evils.
xÂ­ Subsequent reflection, and events since occurring,
reÂ­
have only served to confirm me in the opinions then
rst
entertained, and frankly expressel.
I must be permitted to add, that no scheme of go.
vernmentalpolicy, unaided by individual exertions,
ti-can be available for amelioatiung the present condiÂ­
,nt
tion of things. Commercial nodesofexchangeatd
0,Â­
a good currency, are but the necessary mains of
in commerce and intercourse, not the direct productive
sources of wealth. Wealth can only be accumulaÂ­
st ted by the earnings of industry, and the sayings of
he frugality; and nothing can. le more ill-judged than
to to look to facilities in. borrowing, or to a redundant
lie circulation, for the power of discharginc pecuniary
to obligations. The country is full of resources, and
the people full of energy, and the great and perniaÂ­
of nent remedy for present embnaarrassments mniust be
to sought in industry, economy, the observance of
sy good faith, and the favorable influence of time.
In pursuance of a pledge given to you in my last
message to Congress, which pledge I urge as an apolÂ­
orÂ­ ogy for adventuring to presentyou tile details of any
32, plan, the Secretary of the i''resury will be ready to
ess submit to you, should you require it, a plan of fÂ­
no nance which, while it throws around the public treaÂ­
be. sure reasonableguards for its protection, and rests
me on powers acknowledged in prnatice'to exist from
the origin of the government, will, at the same time,
furnish to the country a sound paper medium, and
500 afford all reasonable facilities for regulating the exÂ­
to; changes. When submitted, you will perceive in it
not a plan, amendatory of the existing laws in relation
hat to the Treasury department--subordinate in all res-.

 pects to the will of Congress directlyv, and the will
of the people indirectly-sellisustaiuin.g: should it
be found in practice to realize its promise in theory,
and repealablle at the pleasure of Congress. It proÂ­
poses by effectual restraints, and by invoking the
true spirit of our institutions, to separate the purse
from the sword; or moreproperly to spea k, denies any.
other control to the President over the agents lho
may be selected to carry it into eXecution, but what
may be indispensably necessary to secure the fidelity
ofsuch agents; & by wiseregulations, keeps plainly
apart from each other, private and public funds. It t
contemplates the establishment ofai Board of Control
at the seat of government, with agencies at prominÂ­
ent commercial points, or wherever else Congress
shall direct, for the safe keeping & disbursement of
thepublic moneys, &a substiturionaat the option of
the public creditor, of Treasury notes, in lieu of gold
and silver. It proposes to limit the issues to an
amount not to exceed $15,000,000-without the exÂ­
press sanction of the Legislative power. It also auÂ­
thorizes the receipt of individual deposits of gold and
silver to a limited amount, and the granting certifiÂ­
cates ofdeposit, divided into such sums as may be
called for by the depositors. It proceeds a step furÂ­
ther,and authorizes the purchase and sale of DomesÂ­
tic Bills and drafts, restingon a real and substantial
basis, payable at sight, or having bata short time to
run, and drawn on places not less than one hundred
miles apart-which authority, except in so far as
may be necessary for Government purposes excluÂ­
sively, is only to be exerted upon the express conÂ­
dition, that its exerciseÂ­ shall not be prohibited by
the State in which the agency is situated.
In order to cover the expenses incident to the plan,
it will be authorized to. receive moderate premiums
for certificates issued on deposits,and on bills bought
and sold, and thus, as far as its dealings extend, to
furnish facilities to commercial intercourse at the
lowesi possible rates, and to subduct from the earnÂ­
ings cfindustry, the least possiblesum. It uses the
State Banks at a distance from the agencies, as auxÂ­
illiaries, without impartingony pqwgr to trade in its
name. It is sfibjected-to sachl gusagrand restraints
as have aplieared to be necessary,. Itis the creaÂ­
ture oflaw, and exists only at the pleasure of theleÂ­
gislature. It is made'to rest on an actual specie
basis, in order to redeem, the notes at.the places. of
issue-produces na dangerous redundancy of circuÂ­
lation-affords no temptatiob to spsculation-is atÂ­
tended by no inflation. ofprices-ts equitable in its
operation--makes the Treasury Notes, which it may
use along with the certificates of deposit, and the
notes of specie paying banks-convertible at the
place where collected, xeceivable in payment of GovÂ­
ernment dues-and, without violating any principle
of the Constitution, affords the Government and the
people such facilities as are called for by the wants
of both. Such, it has appeared to me, areitsrecomÂ­
mendations, and irnview of them it will be submit.
ted, whenever you may require it to your consideraÂ­
tion.
I am not able to perceive that any fair and candid
objection can be urged against the plan, the princiÂ­
pal outlines of which I have thus presented. I canÂ­
not doubt but that the notes whichfit proposes to
furnish, at the voluntary option of the public erediÂ­
tor, issued in lieu of the revenue and its certificates
of deposit, will be maintained at an equality with
gold and silver every where. They ire redeemable
in gold and silver ondemand at the places of issue.
They are receivable every where in payment of GovÂ­
ernment dues.. The Treasury rdtes are limited to
an amount of one-burth less than the estimated anÂ­
nual receipts of the Treasury; and in addition they
rest upon the itif of the Government for their reÂ­
demption. Ifu all these assurances are not sufficient
to make them available, then the idea, as it seems to
me, of furnishing a sound paper medium of exchanÂ­
ges, may be entirely abandoned.
If a fear be indulged that thd Government
may be tempted to run into excess in its issues,
at any future day, it seems to me that no sucb
I apprehension can reasonably be. entertained,
until allconfidence in the representatives of the
States and of the people, as well as of the peoÂ­
ple themselves, shall be lost. The weightiest
considerations of policy require that the reÂ­
straints now proposed to be thrown around the
measure should not, for light causes, be rernoÂ­
ved. Toarguei against any proposed plan its
liability to possible abuse, is to reject every cxÂ­
pedieut, since every thing dependent on human
action is liable to abuse. Fifteen millions of
Treasury notes may be issued as the tmaximum,
but a discretionary.power is to be given to the
Board of Control, under that sum, and every
consideration willunite in leading them to feel
their way with caution. For the eight first
years of the existence of the late Bank of the
United States, its circulation barely exceeded
S8$4,000,000;
and for five of' itprtrgst prosperous

I
thermore, the authority given to ieteive private
i
deposites to a; limited amount, and to issue cer.
tificates in such sums as may be called for by
Sthe depositors, may so far fill up the channels of
t
circulation as greatly to diminish the necessity
of any considerable issue of Tieasury notes. A
restraint upon the amount of private deposits has
a
seemed to be indispensably necessary, from an
- apprehension thought to bem wellfounded, that
in any emergency of trade, confidence might be
so far shaken in the banks as to induce a withÂ­
I drawal from them of private deposits, with a
- view to insure theirunquestionalile safety when
deposited with the Government, which might
prove eminently disastrous to the State Banks.
I s it objected that it is proposed to authorize the
agencies to deal in Bills of Exchange? It is anÂ­
swered, that sucir dealings are to be carried on
at the lowest possible premnium-are made to
rest on an unquestionably sound basis-are deÂ­
signed to re-imburse merely the exspenses which
- would otherwise devolve upon the Treasury, and
tare in strict subordination to the decision of the
1Supr:ame
Court, in the case of the Bank of Au.

I diction, which I hold to be indispensaby requiÂ­
a site. It leaves the banking. privileges of the
f States without interference-looks to the TreaÂ­
a sury and the Union; and, while furnishing every
- facility to the first is careful of tlihe interests of the
last. Above all, it iscreated bylaw, isamendable
by law, and is repealable by law;and wedded as I
r amn to no theory, but looking solely to the adÂ­
s vancemnent of the public good,rI shall be amongst
: the very first to urge its repeal; if it be found
a not to subserve the purposes and objects for
a which it may be created. Nor will the plan be
a submitted in any overweening confidence, in
e the stifficiency of my own' judgment, but with
muebh greater reliance on the wisdom and patÂ­
p riotism of Congress. I cannot abandon this sub.
f ject without urging upon' you, in the most emÂ­
phatic manner, whatever may be your action
, on the suggestions which J have felt it be my
duty to submit, to relieve tle Chief Executive
y Magistrate by any and all constitutional means,
i"" from a controlling power over the public Trea.
e sury. If, in the plan proposed, should you deem
it worthy of your consideration, that separation
rÂ­
is not as complete as you may desire, you will,
0e doubtless, amend it in that particular. For myÂ­
!t self, I disclaim all desire to have any control
is
over the public moneys, otherlthan what is inÂ­
dispensably necessary, to execute the la hic4i h
id you-iay pass.
, Por can I fail to advert, in .thi connection, to
e,
the debts which many of the States of theUnion
te have contracted abroad,and under which they conÂ­
rÂ­ tinue to labor. That indebtedness amounts to a
to sum not less than -$200,000,000, and which has been
oe retrilited to them,for the most part in works ofinporÂ­
nal improvement,which are destined to prove 6f vast
is importance in ultimately advancing thetr prosperity
of
and wealth. For the debts thus coitracted,the States
e. are alone responsible. I can do no more than exÂ­
Id
press the belief that each State will feel itself bound
s. by every consideration of honor, as well as of interÂ­
i. est, to meet its engagements with punctuality.Â­
a. The failure, however, of any one State to doso,
or should in no degree affect the credit of the rest; and
p the foreign capitalists will have no just cause to exÂ­
es
perience alarm as to all other State stocks, because
it any one or more of the States may neglect to pro.
v~ilde with punctuality the means of redeemingtheir
engagements. Even such States, should their be
any. considering the great rapidity with which their
resources are developing themselves; will not fail to
have the means, at no very distant day, to redeem
a their oAligations to'the utmost farthing; nor will I
+ doubt but that in view'of that honorable donduct
which has ever more governed the States, and the
SP-'eohle of this Union, they will each and all resort
:o everylegitimate expedient, before they will furÂ­
Ve
go a tithtful
compliance-ith their obligations.
From the report of the Secretary of War, and othÂ­
rn reports accompanying it, you will ba informed of
the progress whice has been made in the fortificaÂ­
tions designed for the protection of our principle ciÂ­
ud ties, roadsteads, and inland frontier, during the
aÂ­ present year; together with their true state and
be condition. They will be prosecuted to completion
of with all the expedition which the means placed by
Congress at the disposal of the Executive will alÂ­
st low.
>lÂ­
I recommend particularly to your consideraÂ­
sy tion, that portion of the Secretary's report which
to proposes the establishment of a chain of military
fiÂ­ posts, front Council Bluffs to some point on the
aÂ­ Pacific Ocean, within our limits,. The benefit
its thereby destined to accrue to our citizens engaÂ­
m ged in.the fur trade, over that wildernessregion,
e, added to the importance of cultivating friendly
ad relations with savage tribes inhabiting it, and at
it the same time of giving protection to our fronÂ­
on
tier settlements, and of establishing the means
s-. ofsafe intercourse between the American settleÂ­




 ments at the mouth of the Columbia river, and I
those on this side of the Rocky Mountaibs, f
would seem to suggest the importance of carryÂ­ f
g
ing to effect the recommendations upon this a
head with as little delay as may Le practicable.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy, will p
place you in possession. of the present condition of
that importantarmn of the national defenec. Every1
effort will bemade to add to its efficiency, aud I canÂ­
not too strongly urge upon you, liberal apppropriÂ­ a
tions to that branch of the public service. InduceÂ­ -
mTents of the-weightiest character exist for the adopÂ­ t
tion of this course of policy. Our extended and it
otherwise exposed maritime frontier, calls for proÂ­ b
tection, to the furnishin of which an efficient naval n
force is indispensable. We look to no foreign conÂ­ n
quests, nor do we propose to enter into competition
n
with any other nation for tupramacy on the Ocean,
-but it is due not only to the honor, bhut to'the seÂ­
curity of the people of the United States, that no
nation should be permitted to invade our waters at t
pleasure. and subject our towns and villages to conÂ­ t
flagrtion or pillage. Economy in all branches of '
the public service, is due from all the public agents a
to the people-but parsimony alone would suggest o
the withholding of the necessary means, for the proÂ­ t
tection of our domestic firesides from invasion, and
our national honor from disgrace. I would most
earnestly recommend to congress, to abstain fiom all
appropriation, for objects not absolutely necessary;
but I takeupon myself, without a moment of hesiÂ­
tancy, all the responsibility of recommending the i
increase and prompt equipment of that gallant NaÂ­
vy, which has lighted up every sea with its victories, I
and spread an imperishable glory over the country. a
The report of the Postmaster General will claim c
your particular attention, not only because of the
valuable suggestions which it contains, but because
of the great importance which,at all times, attaches
to that interesting branch of the public service. The
increased expense of transporting the mail along the
principal routes, necessarily claims the public attenÂ­
tion, and has awa kened a corresponding solicitude s
on the part of the Goveriinemnt. The transmission e
of the mail must keep pace with, those facilities of a
intercom:nunication which are every day becoming t
greater through the building of railroads, and the C
application of steam power-hut it cannot be disÂ­ F
guised, that, in order to do so, the Post Office DeÂ­ S
partment is subjected to heavy exactions. The t
lines of communication between distant parts of a
the Union. are, to a great extent; occupied by railÂ­ s
roads, which, in the nature of things, possess a comÂ­
plete monopoly, and the Department is therefore liÂ­
able to heavy and unreasonable charges. This evil a
is destined to great increase in future, and some
timely measure may become necessary to guard s
against it.
I feel it my duty to bring under your considÂ­
oration a practice which has grown up in the adÂ­
ministration of the Government, and which, I
am deeply convinced, ought to be corrected. I
allude to the exertise of the power, which usage, t
rather than reason, has vested in the Presidents, I
of removing incumbents from office, ir. order to I
substitute others more in favor with the domi.
nant party. My own conduct, in this respect,
has been governed by a conscientious purpose to
exercise the removing power, only .in cases of
unfaitithfulness or inability, or in those in which
its exercise appeared necessary, in order to disÂ­
countenance and suppress that spirit of active
partisanship on the part of holders of office,
which not only withdraws them from the steady
and impartial discharge of their official duties,
but exerts an undue and injurious influence ovÂ­
er elections and degrades the character of the
Government itself, inasmuch as it exhibits the
Chief Magistrate, as being a party, through his
agents, in the secret plots or open workings of
political parties.
In respect to the exorcise of this power, noÂ­
thing should be left to discretion, which may
safely be regulated by law; and it is of high imÂ­
portance to restrain, as far as possible, the stimÂ­
ulus of personal interests in public elections.
Considering the great increase which has been
made in public offices, in the last quarter of-a
century, and the probability of further increase,
we incur the hazard of witnessing violent politiÂ­
cal contests, directed too often to thesiug le object
of retaining office. by those who are in, or obÂ­
taining it, by those who are out, Under the in
fluence of these convictions, I shall cordially
concur in any constitutional measures for reguÂ­
lating, and by regulating, restraining the power I
of removal.
I su~ggest for your consideration, the propriety
of making, without further delay, some specific
application of the fuondr derived unddr tle swill
of Mr. Smithson, of England, for the diffusion
of knowledge, and which have, heretofore, been
vested in public stocks, until such time as ConÂ­
gress should think proper to give them a specific
direction. Nor will you, I feel confident, perÂ­
mit any abatementof the principal of the legacy
to be made, should it turn out that the stocks,
in vwhich the investments have been made, have
undergone a depreciation.
In conclusion, I commend to your care the
interests of the District, for which you are the
exclusive legislators. Considering that this city
is the residence of the Government, and, for a
large part of the year, of Congress, and, considÂ­
ering, also, the great cost of the Public BuildÂ­
ings, and the propriety of affording them at all
times careful protection, it seems.not unrcasonaÂ­
ble that Congress should contribute towards the
expense of an cflicient police.

This plain question comes home to |

Miger a question that all the cheaper, ]a

ither alum, lime or phosphatic acid. As
jath as we may bo to admit so much
gainst what may have been some of ?i

ree from some one of tliese objectiona- Qf
le ingredients except the Royal, and 8J1
liut they report as chemically pure. We a,
nd some of the baking powders adver- t
ised as pure, to contain, under the testa c'u
f Professors Chandler, Ilabirslmw and
there, nearly twelve per cent of te
inie, while others aro made from alum
ritli no cream of tartar. This, we pre- jc
ume, accounts for their lack of leaven- n(
eg power as sometimes complained of cf
iy the cook, and for the bitter taste cj
ound in the biscuits so frequently com- yj
ilained of by ourselves.
But aside from the inferiority of the V1
pork done by these powders, the phy- ln
icians assure us that lime and alum o]
aken into the system in such quantities
s this aro injurious. Their physiologial
effects aro indigestion, dyspepsia, or tj
roree evils. "" t(1
The question naturally arises, why do
heso cheap baking powder makers use j)(
hese things? Alum is three cents a tj
)ound, lime is still cheaper, while cream g(,
>f tartar costs thirty-live or forty. The jg
easons for the chemical purity of the
loyal Baking Powder were recently Jte
fiven in the New York Times in an ineresting
descri]>tion of a new method
or refining argols, or crude cream of tar- e,
ar. It seems that it is only under this ^
roccss that cream of tartar can be freed UJ

Umbrella Flirtation.
To place your umbrella in a rack inÂ­
dicates that it is about to change ownÂ­
ers.
To open it quickly in the street means
that somebody's eye is going to be put
out.
To shut it, that a hat or two is to be
knocked off.
An umbrella carried over the woman,
the man getting nothing but the dripÂ­
pings of the rain, signifies courtship.
When the man has the umbrella
and the woman the drippings, it indiÂ­
cates marriage.
To punch your umbrella into a person
and then open it, means, "" I dislike
you."" *
To swing your umbrella over your
head signifies, ""I am making a nuisance
of myself.""

TRENT AFlFAIR.
l The following are the despatches in which the
British and Federal American governments have
treated diplomatically of the Trent affair:
Ilt. SEWARD TO MB. ADfAMS.
IS Department of State, Washington, Nov. 30, 1861. .
r-Charles Francis Adams, Esq.,&c.-Sir,-Your confidential
ia note of the 15th of November, not marked as a despatch,
3. has been submitted to the President and I hasten to reply
to it in time for the Wednesday's mail.
No minister ever spoke or acted more wisely in a crisis
whichbexcited deep public solicitude than you did on the
occasion of the Lord Mayor's dinner.
-We are impressed very favourably by Lord Palmerston's
conversation with you. You spoke the simple fact when you
told him that the life of this insurrection is sustained by its t
hopes of recognition in Great Britain and France. It would
perish in ninety days if those hopes should cease. I have
never for a moment believed that such a recognition could
take place without producing immediately a war between
the United States and all the recognising powers.
t I have not supposed it possible that the British governÂ­
ment could fail Do see this, and at the same time I ha veo
sincerely believed the British government must, in its In. -
most heart, be as averse to such a war as I know this goÂ­ q
vernment is. a
I am sure that this government has carefully avoided a
giving any cause of offence or irritation to Great Britain. a
a
But it has seemed to me that the British government has S'
been inattentive to the currents that seemed to be bringing a
I the two countries into collision. . . . . . .I
I infer from Lord Palmerston's remarks that the British
government is now awake to the importance of averting b
possible conflict, and disposed to confer, and act with I
earnestness to that end. If so, we are d posed to meetA
them in the same spirit, as a nation chiefyof British lineage, T
sentiments and sympathies, a civilised and humane nation, a
Christian people.
Since that conversation was held, Captain Wilkes, in the tI
steamer San Jacinto, has boarded a British colonial steamer El
and taken from her deck two insurgents who were proceedÂ­ Sl
ing to Europe on an errand of treason against their own
country. This is a new incident, unknown to and unforeÂ­ W
seen, at least in its circumstances, by Lord Palmerston. It di
is to be met and disposed of by the two governments, if at
possible, in the spirit to which I have adverted.
Lord Lyons has prudently refrained from opening the d
subject to me, as, I presume, wuiting instructions from PI
home. We have done nothing on the subject to anticipate |
the discussion, and we have not furnished you with any m
explanations. We adhere to that course now, because we an
think it more prudent that the ground taken by the British th
government should be first made known to us here, and m,
that the discussion, if there must be one, shall be had here.
It is proper, however, that you should know one fact in 0
the case, without indicating that we attach importance to as
it, namely, that in the capture of Messrs. Mason and Slidell aMX
on board a British vessel, Captain Wilkes having acte a
without any instructions from the government; the subject r
is therefore free from the embarrassment whichSmight aveI
resulted if the act had been specially directed by us
I trust that the British government will consider the sub. to
l eet in a friendly temper, and it may expect the best disÂ­ gm
positions on the part of this government. b d I
Although this is a confidential note, I shall not object to
your reading it to Earl Russell and Lord Palmerston, if '
y
ou deem it expedient.-I am, sir, your obedieiit servant,

Mfy Lord,-Intelligence of a veryr grave nature has U
reached her Manjesty's govemnrasit. this intelligence was (I
conveyed officially to the knowledge of the Admrlty by of
lCommander Willbams, agent for mails on hoard the o wn-.p

It appears from the letter of Commander Willias, dated Diei i
1.
P I




 Royal Mail Contract Packet Trent, at sea, November 9th,
that the Trent left Havannal on the 7th inst. with her
Majesty's mails for England, having on board numerous
passengers. Commander Williams states that shortly after
.noon on the 8th' a steamer, having the appearance of a manÂ­
of-war, but not showing colours, was observed a-head. On
er nearing her at a quarter past 1 p.m., she fired around shot
h from her pivot gun aceoss the Treat and showed American
tc Xolours. While the Trent was approaching her slowly the
American vessel discharged a shell across the bows of the
in Trent,exploding half acable's lengtha-headof her. The Treat
ad then stopped, and an officer with a large armed guard of
marines boarded her. The officer demanded a list of the pasÂ­
s engers, and compliance with this demand beingrefused, the
officer said he had orders to arrest Messrs. Mason, Slidell,
of M'Farland, and Eustie, and that he had sure information of
ge their being passengers in the Trent. While some parley
was going on upon this matter, tr. Sidell stepped forward
and told the American officer that the four persons he had
n
Iamed were then standing before him.
The commander of the Trent andCommauder Williams
to protestedagainstthe act of taking by force,out of the
Treat, thiesef our passengers, then under the protection of the
ieÂ­ Britisb~flag. But the San Jacinto was at that time only
lie hundred yards from the Trent, her ship's company at
ad quarters, her ports open, and tompions out. Resistance was
'of therefore out of the question, and the four gentlemen before
rtÂ­ namedwereforcibly takenout oft teship. A furtherdemand
was made that the commander of the Trent should proceed
y on board the San Jacinto, but he said he would not go unÂ­
he less forcibly compelled likewise, and this demand was not
viÂ­ insisted upon.
3IÂ­ It thus appears that certain individuals have been forcibly
:s. taken from on board a British vessel, the ship of a neutral
re power, while such vessel was pursuing a lawful and innocent
voyage, an act of violence which was an affront to the BriÂ­
lat tishHlag and a violation of international law.
Mt Her Majesty's government having in mind the friendly
iar relations which have long subsisted between Great Britain
nd, and the United States, are willing to believe that the
United States naval officer who committed this aggression
was not acting in compliance with any authority from his
rig government, or that if be conceived himself to be so authoÂ­
she rised, he greatly misunderstood the instructions which he
to had received.
of FLIr the government of the United States must he fully
aware that the British government could not allow such an
affront to the national honour to pass without full reparaÂ­
ral tion, and her Majesty's government are unwslling to believe
rnd that it could be the deliberate intention of the government
IdÂ­ of the United States unnecessarily to force into discussion
:ed between the twogoveruments a question of so grave a chaÂ­
racter, and with regard to which the whole British nation
would be sure to entertain such unanimity of feeling.
Lus Her Majesty's government, therefore, trust that, when
1ie the matter shall have been brought under the consideration
InÂ­ of the government of the United States, that government

aÂ­ will propose them to him.

ess Department of State, Washington, Dec. 26, 1861.
belMy Lord,-Earl Russell's desPatch of' November the
e 30th, a copy of which you have left with me at my request,
i.h is of the following effect-namely, that a letter of ComÂ­
mander Williams, dated Royal Mail contract boat Trent, at
ail sea, Nov. 9, states that that vessel left Havannah on the
7th of November, with her Majesty's mails for England,
arÂ­ having on board numerous passengers.
Igo Shortly afternoon on the 8th of November, the United
States war steamer San Jacinto, Captain Wilkes, not showing
xvel colours, was observed ahead. That steamer, on being neared
ist. by the Trent, at one o'clock fifteen minutes in the afterÂ­
bhle noon, fired a round shot from a ivot gun across her bows
ish and showed American colours. While the Trent was apÂ­
proaching slowly towards the San Jacinto, she discharged a
shell across the Trent's bows, which exploded at half a
eo. cable's length before her. The Trent then stopped, and an
officer with a large armed guard of marines boarded her.
ec. The officer said he had orders to arrest Messrs. Mason,
key Slidell, McFarland and Eustis, andlhad sure information that
a they were passengers in the Trent. While some parley was
goingon upon this matter,Mr. Slidellsteppedforward andsaid
to the American officer that the four persons he had named
toÂ­ were standing before him. The commander of the Treat
'in and Commander Williams protested against the act of
m | taking these four passengers out of the Trent, theythen being
under the protection of the 'British flag But the San
Jacinto was at this time only 200 yards distant, her ship's
wnÂ­
company at quarters, her ports open and tompions out, and
reIso resistance was out of the question.
r. The four persons bifore-named were tbken fWAibly taken
vas out of the ship. A farther dhimaid was made theat the
of commander of the Trent should proceed on board the San
Jacinto. but he said he would not go unless forcibly comÂ­
In c likewise, and this demand was not insisted upon.
01Â­ | *Ipon this statement Earl Russell remarks that it thus
)er appears that certain individuals have been forcibly taken
*a | from on board a British vessel, the ship of a neutral power,
,at whwe that ve asel was pursuing a lawfu and innocent voyage
a-an act of violence which was an affront to the British flag
en and a violation of international law.
Earl Russell next says that her Majesty's government,
iat bearin mind the friendly relations which have long subÂ­
40 sisted between Great Britain tand the United States, are
ilt willing to believe that the naval ofcer who committed this
la | aggression was not acting in compliance with any anehority
tlfrom his government, or that if he conceived himself to be
to authorsed he greatly misunderstood the instructions
which he received.
rn Earl Russell argues that the United States must be fully
aware that the British government could not alow such an
affront on the national honour to pass without full reparaÂ­
tion, and they are willing to believe that it could not be the
deliberate intention of the government of the United States
lee unnecessarily to force into discussion between the two
Dr, governments a question of so grave a character, and with
1a regard to which the whole British nation would be sure to
entertain such unanimity of feelingn
.| Earl Russell, resting upon the statement and the arguÂ­
le ment which I have thus recited, closes with saying that
her Majesty's government trust that when this matter
shal have been brought under the consideration of the
government of the United States, it will, of its own accord,
LE offer to the British government such redress as alone could
satisfy the British nation, namely, the liberation of the
four prisoners taken from the Trent, and their delivery to
your lordship, in order that they may again be placed under
be British protecdion, and a suitable apology for the aggression
ve which has been committed. Earl Russell finally instructs
you to propose these terms to me, if I should not first offer
them on the part of this government. This despatch has
been submitted to the President.
The British government has rightly conjectured, what it
ial is my duty to state, that Captain Wilkes, in conceiving and
h, executing the proceeding in question, acted upon his own
ly suggestions of duty, without any direction, or instruction, or
even fore-knowledge of it, on the part of this government.
3isNo directions had been given to him, or any other naval
he officer, to arrest the four persons named, or any of them,
on the Trent, or on any other British vessel, at the place
i where it occurred or elsewhere.
on The British government will justly infer from these facts
that the United States not only have bad no purpose,
Id but even no thought, of forcing into discussion the question
which has arisen, or any other which could affect in any
Id way the sensibilities of the British nation.
m It is true that a round shot was fired by the San Jacinto
from her pivot gun when the Trent was approaching; but
as the facts have been reported to this government, the
. shot was, nevertheless, intentionally fired in a direction so
- obviously divergent from the course of the Trent as to he
a quite as harmless as a blank shot, while it should be reÂ­
garded as a signal. So also we learn that the Treat was noti
d approaching the San Jacinto lowlv when the shell was fired
a across her s ows; but, on the contrary, the Treat was, or
.iseemed to be, moving under a full head of steam, as if with I
la purpose to pass the San Jacinto.
g We are informed also that the hoarding officer (Lieutenant i
h Fairfax) did not board the Treat with a large armed guard,
but he left his marines in his host when he entered the l
Treat. Hestated his instructions fron Captain Wilke to 1
isearch for the four persons named in a respectful and cour-l
teous though decided manner, and he aked the catain of the
Trent to show his passenger listwhich was refued. ThelieuÂ­
tenant, as we are informed, did not employ absolute fores ine
e transferring the passengers, but he used uet so much as was
necessary to satisfy the parties concern that refusal or re-I
sistance would be unavailing. So, also, we are informed'
that the captain of the Trent was not at any time, or in any I
way, required to go on board the San Jacinto. These o-.
tdificatuoas of the case as presented by Commander Williams mm
fare based upon our official reports. 3
I have now to remind your lordship of some facto, which p
doubtlessly were omitted by Earl Russell, with the very
proper and becoming motive of allowing them to be brought h
into the case on the part of the United States, in the wayo
most satisfactory to this government, n
IThesefacts are, that, at the time the transaction occurred, b
an insurrection was existing in the United States, which ti
this government was engaged in suppressing by the employÂ­ mi
ment fland and naval forces; thatÂ½ in regard to this
domestic stife, the United States considered Great Britain oc
as a friendly power, while she has assumed for herself the si
atitude of a neutral; and that Spain was considered in theÂ­ i
samne light, and had assumed the same attitude as Great am
It had been settled by correspondence that the United
States and Great Britain mutually recognised as applicable of
to this local strife these two articles of the declaration gi
made by the Congress of Paris in 1858, namely :-That the TI
neutral or friendly flag should cover enemy's goods not conÂ­ h)
trabead of war, and that neutral goods, not contraband of he
wrar, are not liable to capture under an enemy's fag. re
These exceptions of contraband frono favonr were a aeÂ­ Nr
gaive acceptance by the parties of the rule hitherto everyÂ­
were recognised as a par of the law of nations, thbat wrhatÂ­ as
ever ie Â¢ontrabanidis liable to capture and confiscaton in sei
SU OWNe. tem
James IL Mason and - MFarland are citizens of the Oil
United Sttes and residents of Virginia. John Shdell and be

inÂ­ John Slideil, in similar circumstances, wHe going to Paris as
on a pretended minister to the Emperor of the French, and
iot George Eustis was the chosen Secretory of Legation for that
an simulated mission.
hs The fact that these persons had assumed sueo characters
1he has been since avowed by the same Jefferson Davis in a preÂ­
sat tended message to an unlawful and insurrectionary Con.
of gress. It was, as we think, rightly presumed that these
asÂ­ ministers bore pretended credentials and inetructions, and
fhe such papers are, in the law, known as despatches. We are inÂ­
al, formed by our consul at Paris that these despatches, having
of escaped the search of the Trent, were actually conveyed and
ley delivered to emissaries of the insurrection in England.
irdAlthough it is not essential, yet it is proper to state, as I
lad doalso upon information and belief, that the owner and
agent and all the oficers of the Trent, including the ComÂ­
na nimander Williams, had, knowledge of the assumed characters
he and purposes ofh e e persons before named whea they emÂ­
he barked on that vessel.
nly Your lordship will now perceive that the case before us,
at instead of presenting a merely flagrant act of violence on the
vae part of Captain Wilkes, as might well be inferred from the
are incomplete statement of it that went up to the British goÂ­
md vernment, was undertaken as a simple, legal, customary,
Bed and belligerent proceeding by Captain Wilkes to arrest and
inÂ­ capture a neutral vessel engaged in carrying contraband of
lot war for the use and benefit of the insurgents.
The question before us is whether this proceeding was
blyauthorised by, and conducted according to the law of nations.
ati It involves the following inquiries :-I. Were the persons
ant named and their supposed despatches contraband of war?
IiÂ­ 2. Might Captain Wilkes lawfully Stop and search the Trent
for these c;Ltraband persons and despatches? 3. Did he
ily exercise that right in a lawful and proper manner? 4.
in Having found the contraband persons on board and in preÂ­
the sumed possession of the contraband despatches, had he a
ion right to capture the persons? I`. Did he exercise that right
his of capture in the manner allowed and recognised by the law
boÂ­ of nations ?
he If all these inquiries shall be resolved in the affirmative,
the British government will have no claim for reparation.
ily I address myself to the first inquiry, namely :-Were the
an four persons mentioned, and ,their supposed despatehes,
IraÂ­ contraband? Maritime law so generally deals, as its proÂ­
eve fessors say, in ren, that is, with property, and so seldom
eant with persons, that it seems a straining of the term contraÂ­
iion band to apply it to them. But persons as well as property
heÂ­ may become contraband, since the word means, broadly:
ion "" contrary to proclamation, prohibited, illegal, unlawful.'
All writers and judges pronounce naval or military persons
len in the sen-ice of the enemy contraband.
ion Vattal says: War allows us to cut off from an enemy all
ont his resources, and to hinder him from sending ministers to
snt solicit assistance, And Sir William Scott says : You may
on, stop the embassador of your enemy on his passage. DeÂ­
spatohes are not less clearly contraband, and the bearers or
ery couriers who undertake to carry them fall under the same
cedcondemnation.
the A subtlety might be raised whether pretended ministers
of an usurping power, not reeognised as legal by either the
tou belligerent or the neutral, could be held to be contraband.
But it would disappear on being subjected to what is the
ary true'test in all cases, namely : the spirit of the law. Sir
py William Scott, speaking of civil magistrates who were
arrested and detained as contraband, says:-"" It appears to
me on principle to be but reasonable that, when it is of
sufficient importance to the enemy that such persons should
be sent out on the public service, at the public expense, it
should afford equal ground of forfeiture against the vessel
that may be let out for a purpose so intimately connected
the with the hostile operations.""
est, I trust that I have shown that the four persons who were
smÂ­ taken from the Trent by Captain Wilkes, and their des.
at patches, were contraband of war.
the The second inquiryis, whether Captain Wilkes had a right
ad, by the law of nations to detain and search the Trent. The
Trent, though she carried mails, was a contract or merchant
ted vessel, a common carrier, for here maritime law knows only
ring three classes of vessels-vessels of war, revenue vessels,
red and merchant vessels. The Trent falls within the latter
terÂ­ clas. Whatever disputes have existed concerning a right
DWs of visitation or search in time of peace, none, it is supposed,
ap-has existediumodern times about therights of a belligerentin
d a timeof war tocapturecontraband inneutral rndeven friendly
if a merchant vessels, and the right of visitation and search, in
an order to determine whether they are neutral and are docuÂ­
mented as such according to the law of nations. I assume
on, in the present case what, as I read in the British authoriÂ­
hat ties, is regarded by Great Britain herself as true maritime
was law, that the circumstance that the Trent was proceeding
laid fromia neutral portto another neutral port doesnot mo.
ned dify the rights of the belligerent power.
-nt The t hird question is, whether Captain Wilkes exercised
of the right of search in a lawful and proper manner. If sany
ing doubt hung over this point, as the case was presented in
San the statement of it adopted by the British government, I
ip's think it must havealready passed away before the mediftÂ­
and cations of that sitatement which I have already submitted.
I proceed to the fourth inquiry, namely: Having found~
ken the auep/ectd coatrtlrabisd Of war on board the Trent, band
the O1aptelntllkM a rglshto aptjure hissamet ,G~uch a capÂ­
9an ture is the ebieft if not the only recognised object of the
SmÂ­ permitted visiitation and search. The principle of' the law
on. as, that the belligerent exposed to danger may prevent the
buscontraband persons or things from applying themselves, or
ken beiog applied to the hostile uses or purposes designed. The
per, law is SO very liberal in this respect, that when contraband
age is found on board a neutral vessel, not only is the contraÂ­
lag band forfeited, but the vessel which is the vehicle of its
passage or transportation,, being tainted, also becomes conÂ­
[nt, traband, and is subjected to capture and confisication.
ibÂ­ Only the fifth question remains-namely: Djd Captain
areWillkes exercise the right of capturing the contraband in
his conformity with the law of nations ? It is jusft here that
ity the difficultiess of the case begin. What is the manner
be whichs the law of nations prescribes for disposing of the
ins contraband when you have found sand seized it on board of
the neutral vessel ?
fly The answer would be easily f ound if the question were
anbWat shall you do with the contraband vessel? . You must
raÂ­ take or send her into a convenient port and subject her to
she a judicial prosecution there in admiralty, which will try and
leasecide the questions of belligerency, neutrality, contraband,
wo and capture. So, again, you wrill promptly find the same
ith answer if the question were, What Is the manner of proceed.
to ing prescribed by the lawa of nations in regard to the conÂ­
traband, if it be property or things of matierial or peen.
toÂ­ niary value?9
it Bu the question here concerns the mode of procedure in
te eard not to the vessel that was carrying the contraband,
she noryst to the contraband things which worked the forfeiture
rd. of the vessel, hot to contraband parsons.
ld The books of law are dumb. Yet the question is as imÂ­
he peortent an it is difficult.. First, the belligerent captior has a
to right too prevent the contraband offier, soldier, sailor, miÂ­
ler nistier, messenger or carrier, from proceeding on his unlawful
on voyage, and reaching the destined scene of his injurious
t srice. But on the other hand, the person captured may
!er be innocent, that is, he may not be contraband.
ins He therefore has a right to a fair trial of the acÂ­
cusation against him. The neutral stats that; has taken
it hime under its flag its bound 1xo protect him if he
ad isnot contraband, and is therefore entitled to be
vnsatisfied upon that important question. The faith of
or that state is pledged to his safety, if innocent, ast its
It. justice is pledged to his surrender, if he is really conÂ­
al traband.
ms, Hers are conflicting claims involving personal liberty
ce life, honour, and duty. Here rare conflict~ing national
claims, involving welfare, safety, honour, and empire.
its They require a tribunal and a trial. The captors and the
le. captured are equals; the neutral and the belligerent state
in are equals. U1
sy While the law authorities were found silent, it was sugÂ­
gested at an early day by this government that you shouldn
to take the captured persons into a convenient port and instiÂ­
a t tute judicial proceedings there to try the controversy. But
he only courts of Admirality have jurisdiction in maritimei
so cases, end thesce courts have formulas to try only clam
be to contraband chattels, but none to try claims concerning
eÂ­ contraband persons. The courts can entertain no proceadÂ­
it ings and render nO judgment in favour or against the i
idalleged contraband men.
ar It was replied, all this is true; but you can reach in
hi these courts a decision which will have the moral weight t
of a judicial one, by a circuitous proceeding. Convey the
it suspelcted anon together with the siuspected vessel, into port, Vd
1, and try there the question whether the vessel is contraÂ­ C
is band. You can prove it to be so by proving the suspected
so men to be contraband, and the courti must then determine 5l
rÂ­ the vessel to be contraband. fl
sleIfthe men are not contraband the vessel will escape conÂ­ si
iÂ­ demnation. Still is there no judgment for or against the s
n captured persons. But it was assumed that there would S
Is result from the detersuinatiosi of the court conceraing the a
nvessel a legal certainty concerning the character of the men.
d This course of proceedn Semed open to many objections.
y It elevates the incidental inferior private interest into the fe
p. roper place of the main paramount public one, and possibly4'i
a at may make the fortunes, the safety, or the existence of a pa
nation depend on the accident of a merely personal anod
pecuniary litigation.
M Ioreover, when the judgment of the prize court upon the 51
tlawfulness of the capture of the vessels is rendered, it reallyw
concludes nothing, and binds neither the belligerent state p1
nor the neutral upon the great question of the disposition to ui
,be made of the captured contraband persons. That quesÂ­
tion is still to be really deterinued, If at all, by diplomatic e'
arrangement or by war, at
.One may wall express his surprise when told that the law fr
lof nations has furnished no more reasonable, practicable,
and oerfectmo~de than thisi of determining qletionsofeiucl I
grav import between sovereign powers. The regret we II
many feel on the occasion is nevertheless modifed by the reÂ­ re
fection that the difficulty is not altogether anomalous
I Similar and equal deficiencies are found in every system di
of municipal law, especially in the system which exists in the an
greater portions of Great Britain and the United States. ch
The title to personal prcierty can hardly ever be resolved lax
by a court without resorting to the fiction that the claimant tih
has lost, and the possessor has found it; and the title of th
real estate is disputed by real'litigants under the names of sic
imaginary persons. de
it most belconfessed, however that while all aggrieved
nations demand and al ruparti3l ones concede the need of IM
some form of judicial process in determining the characÂ­ TI
ters of contraband persons, no form than the ilogical and Ot
crcuitous one thus described exists, nor has eny other yet
been uggested. Pracatlly therefore, the choie. is beÂ­ p]
tween that. judicial remedy or no judicial remedy whatÂ­ lee
ever. wa
If there beÂ­ no judiial remedy, the result is that the nsU
question must be determined by the captor himself on the PI
deck of the prize vesseL Very grave objections are against
,





ea such a course, The captor is armed, the nieutral is
ed unarmed. The captor is interested, prejudiced, and
,Ai perhap violent, the neutral, if truly neutral, is disintebÂ­
rested, subdued, and helpless.
as The tribunal is irresponsible while its judgment is carried
nd into instant execution. The captured party is compelled to
unt Submit, though bound by no legal, moral, or treaty obligaÂ­
tion'to acquiesce. Reparation is distant and problematical,
rs. an dpnds at last on the justice, inagnsuitoxty, or weakÂ­
i's easso the state in whose behalf and by whose authority
in. the capture was made.
mes Out of these disputes, reprisals and wars necessarily arise,
nd and these sre so frequent and destructive that it may well
in. be doubted whether this form of remedy is not a greater
ngsocial evil than all that could follow if the belligerent right
nd of search were universally renounced and abolished for ever.
id. But carry the case onie step further.
I What if the State that lasa made the capture unreasonably
nd refuses to hear the complaint of the neutral or to redress
mnÂ­ it? In that case the verv act of capture would be an act
srs of war, of war begun without notice, and possibly entirely
mÂ­ without provocation.
I think all unprejudiced minds will agree that, imperfect
a e, as the existing judicial remedy may be supposed to be, it
ihe would be, as a general practice, better to follow it than to
he adopt the Summary one of leaving the decision with the
InÂ­ captor, and relying upon diploinatic drebates to review his
ry, decision. Practically it is a question of choice between law,
ndWith its imperfections and delays, and war, with its evilsi
of asnd desolations.
Nor is it ever to be forgotten that neutrality, honestly
ras and justly preserved, is always the harbinger of peace, and is
is. therefore the common interests of nations, which is only,
ins saying that it if; the interest of humanity itself.
r? At the same time it is not to he denied that it may someÂ­
Mt times happen that the judicisl remedy will become impossiÂ­
he hls-as by the shipwreck of the prize vessel, or other cirÂ­
4. cumsetances, which excuse the captor from sending or takin
reÂ­ her into port for confiscation. In such a case the right of
e a, the captor to the custody of the captured persons, and to
1hit dis ef them, if they are really contraband,Â­ so as to
cospdel their unlawful purposes, cannot reasonably be denied.
What rule shall be applied in such a case ? Clearly the
ye, captor ought to he required to show that the failure of the
judicial remedy results from circumstances beyond his conÂ­
the trol and without his fault. Otherwise he would be allowed
LOS, to derive advantage from a wrongful act of his own.
in-. In the present case, Captain Wilkes, after capturing the
Ora contraband persons and making prize of the Trent in what
s.seensa to us a perfectly lawful mnanner, instead of sending
rty her into port, released her from the capture, and permitted
.11her to proceed with her whole cargo upon her voyage..ti,
H. le thus effectually prevented the judicial examinto
iswhich might otherwise have occurred. lf now the capture
of the contraband persons and the capture of the contra.
all band vessel are to be regarded, not as two separable or
to distinct transactions, 'under the law of nations, but as one
iaY transaction, one capture only, then it follows that the
)eÂ­ ea ture in this case was left unfinished or was abandoned.
io hether the United States have a, right to retain the
me chief publio benefits of it, namely, the custody of the capÂ­
tured persons, on proving them to he contraband, will deÂ­
ere pond upon the preliminary question whether the leaving of
bbs he transaction unfinished was necessary, or whether it
ad. was unnecessary, and therefore voluntary. If it was necesÂ­
lbs sary, Great Britais, as wye suppose, must, of course, waive
Sir the defect, and the consequent failure of the judicial
erne remedy.
Ito On the other hand, it is not seen how the United States
I Of can insist upon her waiver of that judicial remedy, if the
aid defect of the capture resulted from an act of Captain
it Wilkes, which would be a fault on their own side.
sel Capt~ain Wilkes has presented to this government his retÂ­
ted sons for releasing the Trent :-"" I forbore to seize her,"" he
says, "" in consequence of my being so reduced in officers
ere and crew, and the derangement it would cause innocent
lea. persons, there being a large number of pasaiengrs who
would have been put to great loss and inconvenience, as
ght well as disappointment, from the interruption it would have
['he caused them in not being able to join the steamer from St.
ant Thomas to Europe. I therefore concluded to sacrifice the
nly interests of my officers and crew in the prize, and suffered
OlN her to proceed, after the detention necessary to effect the
Lter transfer of these commissioners, considering I had obtained
ght the important end I had in view, and which affected the inÂ­
ed, terests nf our country and interrupted the action of that of
tnthe Confederates.""
d~ I shall consider, firest how these ressons ought to affect
In the action of this government; and secondly, how they
noÂ­ ought to be expected to affect the action of Great Britain.
m~e The reasons are satisfactory to this goernment, so faii as
~r-Captain Wilkes its concerned. It could net desire that the
Pne San Jacinto, her officers, and crew, should b.'exposed to
Ing danger and loss by weakening their number to detach a6
no prize crew to go on board the Trout. still loes could it
disavow the humane motive of preventing inconveniences,
ssd losses, and perhaps disasters, to the several hundred innoÂ­
ii*y cent; passengers found on board the prize vessel.
in Nor could this government perceive any ground for ques.

mdo position of the captured persons.
This government cannot censure him for this oversight. It
'ra confesses that the whole subject came unforeseen upon the
its governmentas doubtlessit did upon him. Its present conÂ­
n.victions on the point inquestionuarethe results of delibeÂ­
*rate examination and deductions now made, and of not any
&i"" impressions previously formed.
in Nevertheless, the question now is, not whether Captain
iat Wllkes is justified in what he did, ubu what is the present
ser view of the government as to the effect of what he has done.
;he Assuinarg now, for argument's sake only', that the release of
of the Trent, if voluntary, involved a waiver of the claim of
the government to hold the captured paerans, tbe United
ire States could, in that case, have no hesitation in saying

id, It is of the very nature of a gift or a charity that the giver
di cannot, after the exercise of hins benevolence is pest, recall

M. We are thus brought directly to the question whether
i we are entitled to regard the release of the Linent as involunÂ­
tary, or whether we are obliged to consider that it was
in Vol Clearly, the release would have been involunÂ­
a an itbeen made solely upon the first ground assigned
Lie for it by Captain Wilkies-inamely, a want of sufficient
inforce to send the prize vessel into port for adjudication.
MlIt is not the duty of a captor to harard his own vessel in
'~order to secure a judicial exanidnation to the captured
~jparty. No large prize crew, however, is legally necessary,
!dfor it is the duty of the captured party to auisend g
us wolln ybefore the tribunal to whose juidction it appeal.
plIf gecaptured party indicated proposes to employ mesas
ofresistance which the captor cannot, with probable safety
'~to himself, overcome, he may properly leave the vessel to
eng owrand neither she nor the salte she represents can
he evratrards justly objet that the captor deprived her of
bethe judicial remedy to which she was entitled.
Of But th scnd rpeason assigned by Captain Wilkes for
its releasing the Trent aiffea from the first. At heat, thereÂ­
n-fore, it must be hold that Captain Wilkes, as he explains
himself, acted from combined sentiments of prudence and
generosity, and so that the release of the prize vessel was
2not strictly necessary or involuntary.
,e Secondly,-How migt we to expect these explanations
he byCpanWle f his own reasons for leaving the capÂ­
tu tre incomplete to affect the action of the British governÂ­
ment? The obeervation upon this point which first occurs
is, that Captain Wilkes's explanations ware not made to
dthe authoraties of the captured vessel.
If made known to them they might have approved and
at taken the release, upon thne condition of waiving a judicial
as snveatajation of the whole transaction, or they migh have
refusedcto accept the release uponithat condition.

shown by us to her, of the value of which favours on both
a sides we ourselves shall be the judge. Of course the United
I States could have no thought of raising such a question in:
Dany case.
I trust I have shown, to the satisfaction of the British
gvernment, by a very simple and natural statement of the
Dfacts and analysis of the law applicable to them that this
rgovernment has neither meditated, nor practise, nor apÂ­
i, proved any deliberate wrong in the transaction to which

I have not been unaware, that in examining this; question
I have fallen into an argument for what seems to be the
British side of it against my own country. But I am
relieved from all embarrassment on that subject.
I had hardly fallen into that line of argument, when I
discovered that I was really defending and maintaining not
an exclusive British interest, but an old, honoured, and
cherished American cause, not upon British authorities, but
upon principles that constitute a large portion of the disÂ­
tinctive policy by which the United States have developed
the resources of a eontinent, and thus, becoming a conÂ­
siderable maritime power, have won the respect and confiÂ­
deuce of many nations.
These principles were laid down for us in 1804 by James
Madison, when Secretary of State in the administration of
Thoma Jefferson, in instructions given to James Monroe,
our minister to Eingland.
Although the cas before him concerned a description of
.persons different front these who. are incidentally the subÂ­
Jects of the present discussion, the ground he assumed then
was the sameI now occupy, and the arguments by which he
sustaine hisl uoithave been an inspiretion to me in
Whenee"" hesa ""property found in a neatral, ia





oapposed to be liable, on any ground, to capture and conÂ­
deninvtion, the rule in all cases is, that the question shall
act be decided by the captor, but be carried before a legal
tribunal, where a regular trial may be had, and whers the
captor himself is liable to damages for an abuse of his
C io t be reasonable, then, or just, that abelligerentooin
mnander who is thus restricted and thus responsible in a case
of mnere property, of trivial amount, should be permitted,
without recurringto any tribunal whatever, to examine
tbe crev of a neutral vessel, to decide the important quesÂ­
tion of their respective allegiances, and to carry that deÂ­
cision into execution by forcingevery individual he may
ehoose into a service abhorrent to his feelings, outting him
<>f ironi his most'teuderconnexions, exposing his mind and
ia uaersoo to the most humiliating discipline, and his life
itself to the greatest danger? Reason, justice, and
humauoity unite in protesting against so extravagant a proÂ­
ceedins.
If I decide this case in favour of my own government I
joust disallow its moat cherished priciples, and reverse and
for eve r abandou its essential policy. The country canqot
afford the saorifice. If I maintain those prinÂ­
ciples and adhere to that policy, I must surrender
the case itself, It will be seen, therefore, that this
governlient could not deny the justice of the claim
presented to us in this respect upon its merits.
We are asked to do to the British nation just what e have
alwavs insisted all nations ought to do to us. The claim
of the British government is not made in a discourteous
manner. This government, since its first orgauiation, has
never used more guarded language in a similar case.
In coming to my conclusion, I have not forgotten that if
the safety of this Union required the detentii of the cap
t*ued persons, it would he the right and duty of this goven
asent t(' detain them. But the effectmal cheek and waning
proportions cf the existing insurrection, as well as the cornÂ­
prastive unimportance of the captured persons themselves,
when dispassionately weighed, happiy forbid me from reÂ­
sorting to that defence.
Nor am I unaware that American citizens are not in any
asueto he unnecessarily surrendered for uny purpose into
the keeping of a foreign state. Only the captured persons,
however, or other who are interested in them, could justly
rase a question on that ground.
Nor have I been tempted at all by suggestions that cases
might be found in history where Great Britain refused to
yield to other nations, and even to ourselves, dlaims like,
that which is now before us. Those cases occurred -when
Great Britain, sa well as the United States, was the home'
of generations which, with all their peculiar interests and
passions, have passed away. She obuld in no other way so
effectually disavow any such inquiries, as we think she
does now, by assumingas her own the grounds upon which
we stood.
It would tell little for our claims to the eharacter of a
mut and magnunimonos 'people if we should so far consent to
=e guided by the law of retaliation as to lift up buried inÂ­
juries from their graves to oppose against What national conÂ­
sistency and the national conscience compel us to regard asra
elaim intrinsically right.
Putting behind me all suggestions of this kind, I prefer to
express my satisfaction that by the adjustment of the preÂ­
sent case upon principles confessed by America, and yet, as
I trust, mutually satisfactorv to both of the nations odnÂ­
earned, a question is finally aid rightly'gettled between them
which heretofore, exhausting not only aill forms of peaceful
discussion, but also the arbitrament of war itself, for more
Uhan half a century, alienated the two countries from each.

-Mr. Henry Mercier, &c.,-Sr,-I have submnitted to the
President the copy you wefe so good 'as to gibe me of a
deepatch addressed to you on the 3rd of December instatit,
concerning the recent proceedings of Captain Wilkes, in
arresting certain persons on board of the British contract
mail steamer Trent.
Before receiving the paper, however, the President had
decided upon the disposition to be made -of the subject
which has caused so much aixiety in Europe. That die.
position of the subject, I think, readers uipuecessary any
discussion' of it, iii reply to the commpents of !. Thouvene].
I am permitted, however, to say, that Mff. Thouvenel has
amt been in error in supposing-first, that the government
of the:United States has:not aeted in any spirit of diste.
gard of the rights or of the Sensibilities of the British naÂ­ '
tion, and that he is equally just in assuming that the 1United
States would consistently vindicate, by their practice oni
bis occasion, the character they have so long maintained
as an advocate of the most liberal principles of neutral states
in maritime war.
.When the French government shall come to see at large
the views of this goverement and those of the government
of Grbat Britain on the subject now in question, and to l
*amepare them with the views expressed by M. Thouvenel
on the part of France, it will probably perceive that while
it moust be admitted that these Ahreepowers are equally imÂ­
pressed with the same desire for the establishment of priu-.
siples favourable to neutral rights, there is, at the 'samen
time, no; such an entire agreenseat concerniuk the applica-I
tion of those principles as is desirable to secure that im-'
:portaist object.
* The government of the 'United States will be happy.
if the occasion which has elicited this correspondÂ­
ense can be improved so asto secureca more definite agreeÂ­
Maent upon the 'wbole'subject by the maritime po leers.i
You will assure M. Thouvebel that this government appreÂ­
iates as well the frankness of his explanations as the spiit'
of friendship and good-will towards the United States in.
which theyare expressed: .
It is a sincere pleasure for the United States to exchange

during a period of twenty-five
years, the opinion thus entertained has
been unreservedly expressed. I declared
it in the Legislature of my native Stale.?

me. In the Senate Chamber, in the pre*

affirmed and reaffirmed, in speeches and
reports there made, and by vutes there
recorded. In popular assemblies I have
unhesitatingly announced it; and the last

justly subject me to the ridicule and scum
of all virtuous men.
I deem it entirely unnecessary at this
time to enter upon the reasons which have
brought my mind to the convictions I feel1
and entertain on this subject. They have j
heen over and orer again repeated. If!
some of those who have preceded me in,
this high office have entertained and avowed
different opinions, I yield all confidence
that their convictions were sincere.
I claim only to have the same measure
meted out to myself. Without going further
into the argument, I will say that
in looking to the powers of this government
to culiect, safely keep, and disburse
the public revenue, and incidentally to
regulate the commerce and exchanges, 1
have not been able to satisfy mvsetf that
the establishment by this Government of
u Bunk of discount, in the ordinary acccpÂ­
taiiou of that term, was & necessary
means, or one demanded by propriety, to
execute those powers. What can the local
discounts of the bank have to do with
the collecting, safe keeping, and disbursing
of the revenue? So far as the mere
j discounting of paper is concerned, it is
j quite immaterial to this question whether
11lie discount is obtained as a State Bank or
a United Slates bank. They are both
j equally local?both beginning and both
| ending in a local accommodation. What
I influence have local discounts, granted by
any formofa bank, in the regulating of the
, currency and the exchanges? Let the his
lory of the late United Slates Bank aid us
in answering this inquiry:
For several years after the establish'
ment of that institution, it dealt almost
1 exclusively in local discounts, and during
that period the country was, for the most
part, disappointed in the consequences
f anticipated from its incorporation. A
r uniform currency was not provided, exÂ­

1 changes were not reguiaieu, arid utile or
r nothing was added to the general circula8
linn; and in 1820 its embarrassments had

able every where in payment of the pubn
lie dues. It had, tip to that period, dealt
h to hut a vt-ry small extent in exchanges,
? eitlter foreign or domestic, and as late as
io 1823 its operations in that line amounted
- to a little more than seven 'millions of
it dfliHars j?er annum. A very rapid atigÂ­

i| mentation soon after occurred, and inj
r 1833 its dealings in exchanges amounted
to upwards of one hundred millions of
dollars, including the sales of its own
drafts; and all these immense transactions
were effected without the employment ofi
extraordinary means. The currency of
f the country became sound, and the negji
ciations in the exchanges were carried on
, at the lowest possible rates, The circui
lation was increased to more than $22,000,i
000, and the notes of the bank were re
i garded as equal to specie all over the
I country; thus showing almost conclusive
ly that it was the capacity to deal in ex
changes, and not in local discounts,
' which furnished these facilities and advani
tages. It may be remarked, too, that

of the hank In the purchase of exchange,
the losses sustained were merely nominal;
while in the line of <liscounts the suspended
debt was enormous, and proved most
disastrous, to thp bank and the country.
Its power of local discount has, in fact,
proved to be a fruitful source of favoritism
and corruption, alike destructive to the
general weal. J J ' ' '
The capital invested in banks of dis- ;
count in the United States, created by i
the States, at this time exceeds $350,000.- i

the reverse is lamentadly the fact. J
Is the measure now under considerera- i
tinn of the objectionable character to >
which 1 have alluded? It is clearly so, I
unlpss by the 16th fundamental article of <
the 11 tit section it is made otherwise.? i
That article is in the following words; I
' The directors of the said corporation i
shall establish one competent office of |
discount and deposiie in any Slate in I
which two thousand shares shall have i
been subscribed, or* may be held, when- i
ever, upon application of the Legislature
of such. State, Congress may by law re- <
quiFe the same, And the said directors i
may also establish one or more competent I
offices of discount and deposite in any ter- ?
rilory or district of the United States, and |
in any State, with the assent of such State; s
and when established, the said office or i
offices shall be only withdrawn or removed i
by the said directors prior to the expira- t
tion of this charier, with the previous t
assent of Congress: Provided, In respect 1
to any State which shall not, at the first ?
session of the Legislature thereof, held <
after the passage of this act, by resolu- I
lion, or other usual legislative proceed- i
ing, unconditionally assent or dissent to s
the establishment of such office or offices r

within it, such assent of the said State I h
shall be thereafter presumed: And provid-,
ed nevertheless, uTliat whenever it shall l<
become necessary of proper for enrrying! a
into execution any of the powers granted t
by the Constitution, to establish an office t
or offices in any of the States whatever, ?
and the establishment thereof, shall he di- f
reeled by law, it shall be the duty of the f
i said officers to establish such offices accor- i
i ditigly."" c
I It wi'l be seen by this clause, the direc- a
tors are invested with the fullest power to i
establish a branch in any State which has t
yielded its assent; and having once estah- t
lished such branch, it shall not afterwards a
be withdrawn, except by order of Con- a
gress. Such assent is to be implied, and g
to have the force and sanction of an actu- r
ally expressed assent, ""provided, in re- \
spect to any State which shall not, at the i
first session of the legislature thereof, ?
held after the passage of this act, by reso c
lution. or other usual legislative proceed- v
ing, unconditionally assent or dissent to c
the establishment of such office or offices i
within it, such assent of said Slate shall c
thereafter be presumed."" The assent or i
dissent is to be expressed, unconditional- j

ly> at the first session of the legislelnre,
by some formal legislative act, and if not
so expressed, its assent is to be implied,
and the directors are thereupon invested
with power, at such time thereafter as they
may please, to establish branches, which
cannot afterwards be wildrawn, except r
by resolve of Congress. No matter what ^
may bo the cause which may operate with i
the legislature, which either prevents it I
from speaking, or addresses itself toils,!
wisdom, to induce delay, its assent is toll
bcynplied. This iron rule is to givewuylr
to no circumstances?it Is unbending and ill
inflexible. It is the language of the mas-' r
ter to the vassal?an unconditional answer [ tl
is claimed forthwith; and delay, postpone- a
ment, or incapacity to answer, produces I
an implied assent, which is ever after ir- 'f
revocable. Many of the State elections h
have already taken place, without any1
knowledge on the part of the people, that ! v
such a question was to come up. The! a
Representatives may desire a submission I
of the question to their constituents, pre- 1
paratoryto final action upon it; but this L
high privilege is denied; whatever may be i
the motives and views entertained by the

representatives ol tnc people, to induce t
delay, their assent is to be presumed, and \
is ever afterwards binding, unless their t
dissent shall be unconditionally expressed i ^
at their first session after the passage of! i
this bill into a Inw. They may, by for-'(
mul resolution, declare the question of as* v
sent or dissent to be undecided and post- \
poned; and yet, in oposition to their express
declaration to the contrary, their
assent is to be implied. Cases innumerable
might be cited to manifest the iriationality
to such an inference. Let one or f
two in addition suflice. f

issent from circumstances at war with Ei
nteresl, 1 caunot but regard as calcula*
ed to excite a feeling at fatal enmity with
lie peace and harmony of the country.
: must, therefore, regard this Clause as thi
isserting the power to be in Congress to au
establish officers of discount in a State, at
nit not only without its assent, but against ca
ts dissent; and so regarding it, I cannot th
auction it. On general principles, the th
ight in Congress to prescribe terms to
iny Slate, implies a superiority of pow- pci
:r and control, deprives the transaction nn
if all pretence to compact, between them, Ci
ind terminates, as we have seen, in the Cc

Money at a Parity.
Washington, Aug. 18. As preÂ­
dicted yesterday, tne senate committee
on finance this uioriiing reported a bill
for tbe repeal of the purchasing clause
of the Sherman act, accompanying it
he a declaration in favor of bimetalism
The committee was in session only an
-hour and the only point of contention
was the overwording of the bill, the
committee having reached a con
clusion yesterday that they would
take dual action today. A bill has
been drawn by Senator Voorhees and
put before the committee this mornÂ­
ing in printed form, the text being in
accordance with the suggestion of
yesterday. The bill thus comes as an
original measure favorably reported,
and will probably be known aa the
Voorhees bill. The votes by which it
was reported are those of Votrhees,
McPherfon, Morrill. ShermaD, Allison
and Aldricb, the latt four named be
lng Republicans.
The full text of the bill is as follows:
Thit bo much of the act approved
July 14, 18'JO, entitled ""an act directÂ­
ing the purchasing of bullion and the
issue of treasury notes thereon, and
for other purposes,"" as directs the sec
retary of the treasury to purchase
from time to time silver bullion to the
aggregate amount of 4,500,000 ounces,
or so much thereof as may be offered
in mnh month at market prices there
of, not exceeding $1 for 871 25-100
grains or pure silver, ana 10 issue in
tiRvuieiit for such purchases treasury
notes of the United States be and the
same is hereby repealed. Ana it Is
hereby declared the policy of the
TJnitedJStatts to continue the use of
both gold and silver as standard money
and coin both gold and silver
into money of equal intrinsic and
exchangeable value. Such equality to
be secured through international agreeÂ­
ment or by such safeguards of legislaÂ­
tion as will insure the maintenance of
a parity in the value of coins of the
two metals and the equal power of
every dollar at all times in the market
inpayment of debts, and it is hereby
declared that the efforts of the governÂ­
ment should be Pteadily directed to the
establishment of such a safe system of
bimetallism as will maintain at all times
the equal power of every dollar coined
or issued by the United States in the
markets and in payment of debts.""
Senator Voorhees will not as he origÂ­
inally intended, ask the senate to tlx a
day for a vote on the bill. He said
this morning that he did not think a
vote would tie had on it for some time
as there appeared to be a disposition
on the part of senators to debate the
measure for an indefinite time. He
will call it up next Tuesday, at which
time he will make a speech on the
financial question generally.

WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, March 4.-General
Grant wis inaugurated as President of the
United States shortly after noon .o-day, in
the presence of one of the most immense
assemblages ever gathered in the national
capital.
The display was magnificent. The proces?
sion which escorted the President elect from
bis headquarters to the capitol was tbe grand?
est ever seen here. The whole city was gaily
decorated with flags, and the accession of the
sew President was welcomed by salvos of ar?
tillery both at the spot and at all the military
pos* in the neighborhood. 4*
The weather was bad, but not enough so to
interrupt the ceremonies. Early in the morning
& build of thieves attempted to rob the street
cars, but after a severe fight they were dis?
persed by the police, several being captured.
Otherwise perfect order was maintained.
The ceremony of swearing in General Grant
took place on a large raised platform on the
east front of the capitol, where thousands
could see, but few could hear what was said.
Here Grant delivered his inaugural in a /
rather low voice, as follows : 1
INAUGURAL ADDRESS.
CUizens oj the ruted ?ta?es-Your suffrages i
ha fing elected me to the office of President of
the United States, I have, in conformity with
the constitution of oar country, taken the
oath of office prescribed therein. I have taken
this oath without mental reservation and with
tbe determination to do, to the best of my abilÂ­
itv, all that it require*, of me.
The responsibilities of the position I feel, but
accept them without fear. The office has como
to me unsought. I commence its duties un?
trammelled. I orin? to it a conscientious de?
sire and determination to fill it to the best of
my ability to tbe satisfaction of the people. On
all leading questions agitating the public mind,
I will always express my views to Congress,
and urge them according to my judgment, and
when I think ic advisable, will exercise the con?
stitutional privilege of interposing a veto to
defeat measures which I oppose; but all laws
will be faithfully executed, whether they meet
my approval or not.
I shall on all subjects have a policy io re?
commend, bat none to enforce against the wil^
of the people. Laws aro to govern all alike,
those opposed to, as well as those who favor
them. 1 know no method to secure the repeal
of bad or obnoxious laws so effective as their
stringent execution.
The country having just emerged from a
great rebellion, many questions will come be?
fore it for settlement iu the next four years
which preceding administrations bave never
had to deal with. In meet mg theso, it is de?
sirable that they should be approached calmly,
without prejudice, hate or sectional prido- re?
membering; that the greatest goud of tho
greatest number is the object to bo attained,
of person, property and for re?gious and poiitÂ­
cal opinion iu every part of our common coun?
try, without regard to local prejudices. Laws
to secure theso ends will receive my host ef?
forts for their enforcement.
A great debt has been contracted in securing
to us and our posterity the Union. The ptyÂ­
ment of this principal and interest, as well as
the return to a specie basis as soon as it can
be accomplished without material detriment to
the debtor class or lo tho country at large,
must be provided for. To protect the national
honor, every dollar of government indebted?
ness should be paid in gold, unless otherwise
expressly stipulated m the contract.
Let it be understood that no repudiator of
one farthing of our public dobt will be trusted
in public place, and it will go tar towards
strengthening a credit which ought to be tho
best in the world, and will ultimately enable us
to replace the debt with bonds bearing less
interest than we now pay. To this should be
added a faithful collection of tho revenue, a
striot accountability to the treasury for every
dol!ar co'leoted, and tho greatest practica?
ble retrenchment in expenditure iu every
department of the government. When
we compare '.ho paying capacity of
the country now with ten States still
in poverty from tho effects of wai, but
soon to cmcrfio, 1 trust, in greater prosperity
than ever beforo, with its paying capacity
twenty-five years ago, and calc?lalo what it
probably will be tweuty-five years hence, who
can doubt tho feasibility of paying every
dollar then with more ease than we
now pay for useless luxuries. Why,
it looks as though Providence had
Viestowed upon us a strong box; the precious
metals locked up in the sterile mountains of
tho far West, which we aro now forging the
key 'o unlock io meet the very contingency
that is now upon us.
Ultimately it may be necessary to increase
ti|e facilities to reach these riches, and it may
be necessary also that the general government
should give its aid to secure tho access. But
that sbonld only be when a dollar of oblig-a
tion to pay secures thc dollar to us now, and
not belore. Whilst Ibo question of specie

payments is in abeyance, the prudont b
ness man is careful about contracting de
payable in tue distant future, and the na
should follow the same rule.
A prostrate commerce is to be rebuilt
all industries encouraged. The young me
tue country, those who from their ago mus
its rulers twenty-five years hence, ban
greater interest in maintaining thc natic
honor. A moment's reflection as to wbat
be our commanding influence among the
tions of thc earth in their day, if they
only true to themselves, should inspire tl
with national pride. All divisions, geograj
cal, politica.1 and religious, can join in t
coinniou sentiment.
How the public debt is to be paid or ape
payments resumed is not so important as t
a policy should bc adopted and acquiesced
The determination to do is worth more tl
divided councils upon the metbod of doi
Legislation upon this subject may not bo
cessary now, nor even advisable; but it will
when the civil law is more fully restored in
parts of tho country, and trade resumes
wonted channels.
It will be my endeavor to execute all Ia
in good faith, to collect all revenues asscssi
and to have them properly accounted for a
economically disbursed.
I will, to thc b;st of my abilily, appoint
offieo only those who will carry out thin (
si sro.
In regard to foreign policy. I would di
with nations as equitable law requires indiv
uals to deal with each other, and I would p'
tee i tho law abiding citizon, who I her of nati
or of foreign birth, wherever his rights a
jeopardized or the fl ig of our country thats,
would respect the rights of all natioi
demanding equal respect for our own.
others depart from thi? mle in their dealin
with ns, we may be compelled to follow thi
precedent.
Tbe proper treatment of the original occ
pants of this land, the Indian, is one deserv?;
of careful e t udy. I will favor any course to war
thuin which tends to their civilization, cur:
tiamzation and ultimate citizenship.
The question of suffrage is one which is like
to agitate the public so long as a portion
their people'ia to bc excluded fro m its privileg
in any State. It seems to me very destral
that this question should be settled now, anc
entertain the hope and express the desire th
it maj be by the ratification of the Fifteen
article of amendment to the constitution.
In conclusion, I ask patient forbearance, on
towards another, throughout the land, and
determine J effort on the part of every citizt
to do his anare towards cementing a happ
union; and I ask the pr ayers of the nation t

President Johnson's Veto of the
Civil Rights Bill. ?
To the Sen ate of the United States :
I regret that the bill which has passed
both Houses of Congress, entitled "" An
act to protect all persons in the United
States m their civil rights, and furnish
.the means for their vindication,"" conÂ­
tains provisions which I cannot approve,
consistently with my sense of duty to the
whole people, and my obligations to the
Constitution of the United States. . I
am therefore constrained to return it to
the Seuate, the House in which it oriÂ­
ginated, with my objections to its beÂ­
coming a law. - -' -
By the first section of the bill, all
persons born in the United States, and
not subject to any foreign power, excluÂ­
ding Indians not taxed, are declared to
be citizens of the United States.: This
provision comprehends the Chinese of
the Pacific States, Indians subject to
taxation, the people called Gypsies, as
well as the entire race designated as
blacks, people of color, negroes, mulatÂ­
toes, and persons of African blood.
Every individual of these races, born in
the United States, is by the bill made
a citizen of the United States. It does
not purport to declare or to confer any
other right of citizenship than Federal
citizensiiip. It docs not purport to give
these classes of persons any status as
citizens of States, except that which
may result from their status as citizens
of the United States. The power to
confer the right of State citizenship is
just as exclusively with the several
States as the po-srer to confer the right
of Federal citizenship is with Congress.
The right of Federal citizenship thus
to be conferred on the several excepted
races before mentioned is now, for the
first time, proposed to be given by law.
If; as is claimed by many, all persons
who are native-born already are, by vir-
tue of the Constitution, citizens of the
United States, the passage of the pendÂ­
ing bill cannot be necessary to make
them such. If, on the other hand, such
persons are not citizens, as may be asÂ­
sumed from the proposed legislation to
make them such, the grave question
presents itself, whether, when eleven of
the thirty-six States are unrepresented
in Congress, at this time it is sound polÂ­
icy to make our entire colored populaÂ­
tion and all other excepted classes citiÂ­
zens of the United States ? Four milÂ­
lions of them have just emerged from
slavery into freedom. Can it be reasonÂ­
ably supposed that they possess the reÂ­
quisite qualifications to entitle them to
all the privileges and immunities of citÂ­
izens 01 the United States ? Have the
people of the several States expressed
such a conviction ? It may also be asked
whether it is necessary that they should
be declared citizens, in order that they
mav be secured in the enjoyment of
civil rights Those rights proposed to
be conferred by the bill are, by Federal
as well as State laws, secured to all
domiciled aliens and foreisners even be
fore the completion of the process of
iiauirauzauon ; ana it may saiely oe asÂ­
sumed that the same enactments are
sufficient to give like protection and
benefits to those, for whom this bill
provides special legislation. Besides,
the policy of the Government, from its
origin to the present time, seems ' to
have been that persons who are strangÂ­
ers to, and unfamiliar with, our instituÂ­
tions and, laws should pass through
a certain probation, at the end of which.
before ?ttaining.thc covetcd prize, they
must give evidence of .their . fitness to
receive and to exercise the rights of cit
izens, as contemplated by the ConstituÂ­
tion of the United States. f. "" j
-;. The bill, in effect, proposes adiscrimÂ­
nation against large numbers of intelÂ­
ligent, worthy, and patriotic foreigners,
aud in favor of the negro, to whom, afÂ­
ter long years of bondage, the avenues
to freedom and intelligence,, have now
been suddenly -opened. He must, of

necessity from his previous unfortunate
condition of servitude, be less informed
as to the nature and character of our

institutions than he who, coming from
abroad, las to some extent at least fa-5
miliarized iimself with the principle
of a Government to which he volunta-.
rily entrusts "" life, liberty, and the pur- X
suit of happiness."" Yet it is now pro- 4
posed, by a single legislative enactment,
to corner the Tights 01 citizens upon all
persons of African descent born within
the extended limits of the United States,
while persons of foreign birth, who
make our land their home, must underÂ­
go a probation of five years, and can
only then, become citizens upon proof
that they are of ''good moral characÂ­
ter, attached to the principles of the
Constitution of the United States, aud
well disposed to. the good order and
happiness of the same."" .') '
The first section of the bill also conÂ­
tains an enumeration of the rights to
be enjoyed by these classes, so made,
citizens, "" in every Stgte and Territory
in the United States."" . These rights
are : ""To make and enforce contracts, to
sue, be parties, and give evidence, to
inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and
convey real and personal property,"" and
to have "" full and equal benefit of all
laws and proceedings for the security
of person and property as is enjqyed by
white citizens."" : So, too, they are made
subject to the same punishment, pains,
and penalties , in common with white
citizens, and to none others. Thus, a
perfect equality of the white and black
races is attempted to be fixed by FedÂ­
eral law, in every State of the Union,
over the vast field of State jurisdiction
covered by these enumerated rights.
In no one of these' can any State ever
exercise any power of discrimination
betwcea the different races.
In the exercise of State policy over
matters exclusively affecting the people
of ach State, ""it has frequently been
thought expedient to discriminate beÂ­
tween the two races. By the statutes
of some of the States, Northern as well
as Southern, it is enacted, for instance,
that no white person shall intermarry
with a negro or mulatto. Chancellor
Kent says, speaking of the blacks, that
"" marriages between them and the
whites are forbidden in some of the
States where slavery does not exist, and
they are prohibited in all the slaveholdÂ­
ing States, and when not absolutely
contrary to law, they are revolting and
regarded as an offence against public
decorum."" ' -
I do not say this bill repeals State
laws on the subject of marriage between
the two races, for as the whites are forÂ­
bidden to intermarry with the blacks,
the blacks can only make such contracts
as the whites themselves are allowed to
make, and therefore cannot, under this
bill, enter into the marriage contract
with the whites. I cite this discrimiÂ­
nation, however, as an instance of the
State policy as to discrimination, and
to inquire whether, if Congress can
abrogate all State laws'of discriminaÂ­
tion between the two races, in the matÂ­
ter of real estate, of suits, and of conÂ­
trats generally, Congress may not also
repeal the State laws as to the contract
of marriage between the two races ?
Hitherto, every subject embraced in the
enumeration of rights contained in this
bill has been considered as exclusively
belonging to the States. , They all reÂ­
late to the internal policy and economy
of the respective States. They are matÂ­
ters which in each State concern the
domestic condition of its people, varyÂ­
ing in each according to its own pecuÂ­
liar circumstances, and the safety and
well-being of its own citizens. I do
not mean to say that Upon all these
subjects there are not Federal restraints,
as, for instance in the State power 01
legislation over contracts, there is a
Federal limitation that no State shall
pass a. law impairing the obligations of
contracts; and as to
crimes, that no
State shall 'pass an ex post facto law ;
and as to money, that no State shall
make anything but gold and silver a
legal tender. But where can we find. a
Federal prohibition against the power
of any State to discriminate, as do most
of them, between aliens and citizens,
between artificial persons called corpoÂ­
rations, and natural persons, in the
right to hold real estate? ,
If it be granted that Congress can reÂ­
peal all State laws discriminating beÂ­
tween whites and blacks in the subjects
covered by this bill, why, it may be
asked, may not Congress repeal in the
same way all State laws discriminating
T)etweenthe two races on the subjects
of suffrage and oflice ? - If Congress can
declare"" by"" law1 ' who shall hold lands,
who shall testify,, who shall have caÂ­
pacity to make a contract: in a State,
then Congress can by law also declare
who, without regard to color or race,
shall have the right to sit as a juror or
as a' judge, to hold any oflice, and,
finally to vote "" in every State and
Territory of the United States."" As
respects the Territories, they come withÂ­
in the power of Congress, for as to them
the law-making power is the Federal
power; but as to the States no similar
provision"" exists, vesting in Congress
the power ""to make rules and regulaÂ­
tions"" for them.
. The object of. thesecond section of
the bill is to afford discriminating proÂ­
tection to colored pessons in the full
enjoyment of all the! rights secured to
them by the preceding section. It deÂ­
clares ""that any person who, under
color of any law,', statute, . ordinance,
regulation, or custom; shall subiect: or
causc.tobe subjected, any inhabitant of
any State or Territory to the deprivaÂ­
; tion of any right 'secured or protected
i by this act, or. to'different punishment.
pains, or penalties on account of 4sueh
person having at any time been held in
a condition .of slavery or involuntary
servitude, except as a punishment for

crime whereof the party shall have been
duly convicted, or by reason of his color
or . race, ; than., is prescribed -for .. the
punishment of white persons, shail. be
deemed guilty of a"" misdemeanor, and,
on conviction, shall be punished by fine
not exceeding one thousand dollars, or
imprisonment not exceeding one year,
or both, in the discretion of the court.""
"";This section seems to be designed to
apply to some existing or future law of
a State or Territory which may conflict
""with the provisions of the bill now un

der consideration. It provides for coun-r
teracting such forbidden legislation by
imposing fine and imprisonment upon
the legislators who may pass such conÂ­
flicting laws, or upon I the officers or
agents who shall put, or attempt to put,
them into execution. It means an ofiv
cial offence, net a common crime comÂ­
mitted against law upon the persons or
property of the black race. Such an
act may deprive the black man of his'
property, but not of his rig ht to hold
property.: It means a . depviv atjon of
the right itself, either by the 'State ju-'
diciary or the State legislature. It is
therefore assumed that un der this secÂ­
tion members of State legislatures, who
should vote for laws conflicting with the
provisions of the bill, that j ud ges of the
State courts who should reider judgÂ­
ments in antagonism with its ';erms, and
that marshals and sheriffs w ho should,
as ministerial officers, exec ute processes
sanctioned by State laws and. issued by
State Judges in execution of their
judgments, could be brou ght before
other tribunals and there s ubjected to
fine and imprisonment for t he performÂ­
ance ofhe duties which su ch State laws
migni impose. ,
The legislation thus provo sed invades
the judicial power of the .tf ite. It says
to every State Court or Ji ldge, if you
decide that this act is unconi ititutional
if you refuse, under the pTO hibition of a
State law, to allow a negro to testify
if you hold that , over uuc.h a subject-
inatter the state law is pa ramount, and
"" under color"" of a State Law refuse the
exercise of the right to the negro your
error of judgment, )iowever conscienÂ­
tious, shall subiect y ou to fine and im
prisonment ! I do m tt apprehend that
the conflicting legislation, which the
bill seems to contemp? ater is so likely to
occur as to render it neoessary at this
time to adopt a measure of such doubt
ful constitutionality.
i - In the next place, ti'iis provision of
;the bill seems to be unnec essary, as adÂ­
equate judicial remedies c iuld be adopt
ed to seenre the desired end without
invading the immunities c if legislators,
always important to bn preserved in
the interests of public libeity ; without
assailing the independence of the judiÂ­
ciary, always essential to the preserva
tion 01 individual right! ) : - and without
impairing the efficiency - of ministerial
officers, always necessa ry for the main
tenance 01 public peace -rm d order. 1 he
remedy proposed by thi s section seems
to be, m this respect, not only anoma
lous but unconstitutional, for the Con
stitution guarantees 1101 J ing with cerÂ­
tainty, if it does not insu re to the several
States the right of inak tr .g and execu
ting laws in regard to a il matters ans-
ing
within their jurisd t 3tion, subject
only to the restriction i Y sit in cases of
conflict with the Constil u tion and con
stitutional laws of the Uni ted States, the
latter should be held to b& the supreme
law 01 tiifi land. . , '

stands, therefore, clear Oi "" doubt that the

second section are intend edfor the State
judge, who, in the cleii exercise of his
functions as a Judge,no-ir ting ministeriÂ­

clusion that the State' law is valid and

ci. . 1 . . . .. it . . r .1..
otaie legislation, so lac as me same is
not inconsistent with the Constitution
and : laws of the United States."" -; So
that. over this vast domain of criminal
jurisprudence provided by each State
tor the protection ot its own citizens,
andior"" the punshment et an persons
who violate its criminal "" laws, Federal
law, wherever it can be made to apply,
displaces State law. . . .
The question here naturally arises,
from what source Congress derives the
power to transfer to Federal tribunals
certain classes of cases embraced in this
section? The Constitution expressly
declares that the judicial power of the
United States "" shall extend to all caÂ­
ses in law and equity arising under this
Constitution, the laws of the United
States, and treaties made, or which shall
be made, under their authority : to all
cases affecting ambassadors, other pubÂ­
lic ministers and consuls : to all cases of
admiralty aud maritime jurisdiction; to
controversies to which the United States
shall be a party ; to controversies beÂ­
tween two or more States, between a
State and citizens of another State, beÂ­
tween' citizens of different States, ""beÂ­
tween citizens of the same State claimÂ­
ing land under grants of different States,
anil between a State, orcitizeDS thereof,
and foreign States, : citizens, or subÂ­
jects."" . .
. Here the judicial power of the United
States is expressly set forth and definÂ­
ed; and the act of September 24, 1789,
establishing the judicial courts of the
United States, in conferring upon the
Federal courts iurisdiction over ' cases
originating in State tribunals, is careful
to coufine them to the classes enumeraÂ­
ted in the above recited clause of the
Constitution. This section of the bill
undoubtedly comprehends cases, and
authorizes the exercise of powers that
are not, by the Constitution, within the
jurisdiction of the courts of the United
States. To transfer them to those courts
would be an exercise of authority well
calculated to excite distrust and alarm
on the part of all. the States, for the
bill applies alike to all of them as well
to those that have not as to those that
have been engaged in rebellion.
It may be assumed that this authority
is incident to the power granted to
Con jress by the Constitution, as recentÂ­
ly auiended, to enforce, by appropriate
legislation, the article declaring that
""neither slavery nor involuntary serviÂ­
tude, except as a punishment for crime,
wh sreof the party shall have been duly
convicted, shall exist within the United
States, or any place subject to their juÂ­
risdiction."" It cannot, however, be
ju stly claimed that, with a view to the
CP.force;ncnt of this article of the ConÂ­
stitution, there is at present any necesÂ­
svty for the exercise of all the powers
Avhich this bill confers. - .
Slavery has been abolished and at
present nowhere exists within the jurisÂ­
diction of the United States ; nor has
there been, nor is it likely there will be
any attempt to revive it by the people
' of the States. If, however, any such
attempt shall be made, it will tueii beÂ­
come the duty of the General GovernÂ­
ment to exercise any and all incidental
powers necessary and proper to mainÂ­
tain inviolate this great constitutional
law of freedom.
The fourth section of the bill provides
that officers and agf nts of the FreedÂ­
nien's Bureau shall be empowered to
make arrests, and aTso that other offiÂ­
cers may be specially, commissioned for
that purpose by the President of the
United States. It also authorizes cir-'
euit courts of the United States, and
h the superior courts of the Territories,
ll . i a 1; ;...!
to appoint, without limitation, commisÂ­
sioners, who are to be charged with the
performance of quasi judicial duties.
The fifth section empowers the commis-;
sioners so to be selected by the court s
to appoint in wilting, under their hands,
one or more suitable persons, from time
to time, to execute warrants and other
processes described by the bill. These
numerous official agents are made to '
constitute a sort of police, in addition.;
to the military, and are authorized toÂ­
summon a posse comitatus, aud eyen toÂ­
call to their aid such portion of the
land' and naval forces of the United
States, or of the militia, "" as may be
necessary to the performance of the
duty with which they are charged."" ,
' This extraordinary power is to be
conferred upon agents irresponsible to
the Government and to the people, to
whoso number the discretion of the comÂ­
missioners is the only .limit,' and in
whose hands such authority might be
made a terrible . engine of wrong, opÂ­
pression, and fraud. The general statues
regulating the land and naval forces o
the United States, the militia, and Sba
execution of the laws, are. believed to
le adequate for every emergency wKda
can occur in time of peace. ' If it should
prove otherwise, Congress can at Jiny
time amend those laws in such marnier.
as while subserving the public weJJare,

liberties of the people. ' 1 - : ,: i ,""

: that under the , influence of such temp
tations bad men might convert any law,
however beneficent, into an instrument
. of persecution and fraud. '
by the eighth section 01 the bill the
United States courts,"" which sit only in
one place for white citizens,' must miÂ­
grate, with the marshal aud district atÂ­
torney, (and necessarily with the clerk,

a violation ot this act; and there the
jjudge and the officers of the court must .
remain, upon the order 01 the tresi-
dent,
'for the time therein
designa
ted."" -. . ' . :
The ninth section authorizes the
President,- Or such person as he may
empower for that purpose, ."" to employ
such: part of the land and naval forces
of the United States, or of the militia,
as shall Tte necessary to. prevent, the
violation and enforce the due execution
of this act."" This language seems to
imply a permanent military force, that
is to be always at hand, and whose only
bnsiuess is to be the enforcement of this
measure over the vast region where it is
intended to operate. .
' I do cot propose to consider the policy
of this bill To me the details of the
bill seem fraught with eviL The white
race and the black race of the South
have hitherto lived together under the
relations ol master and slave capital
owning labor. Now, suddenly, that reÂ­
lation is changed, and, as to ownership,
capital and labor are divorced. They
stand now each master of itself. In this
new relation, one being necessary to the
other, there will be a new adjustment,
which both are deeply interested in
making harmonious. Each has equal
power iu settling the terms, 'and if left
to the laws that regulate capital and
labor it is confidently believed that
they will satisfactorily work out the
problem. . Capital, it is true, has more
intelligence; but labor is never so ignorÂ­
aut asnot to understand its own interÂ­
ests, not to know its own value, and not
to see that capital must pay that value.
This bill frustrates this adjustment. It
intervenes between capital and labor,
and attempts to settle questions of po
litical economy through the ageucy of
numerous omcials. whose interests it
will be to foment discord between the
two races: for' as the breach widens
their employment will continue,"" and
when it is closed their occupation will
"" terminate.
, In all our histoiy, in all our experience
p,s a people living under Federal aud
State law, no such system as that con
templated by the details of this hill has
ever before been proposed or adopted.
They establish, for the security of the
colored race, safeguards which go inÂ­
finitely beyond any that the General
Government lias ever provided for the
white race. In fact, the distinction of
race and color is bv the bill made to
operate in favor of the colored and
against the white race. They interfere
with the municipal legislation of the
States, with the relations existing ex
clusively between a State and its citi
zens, or between inhabitants of the
same State-an absorption aud assump-'
tion 01 power by the fcrenerai GovernÂ­
ment which, if acquiesced in, must sap
and destroy our federative system of
limited powers, and break' down the
barriers which preserve the rights of the
States. . It is another step, or rather
stride, towards centralization and the
concentration of all legislative powers
in the National Government."" The ten
dency of the bill m ust bo to resuscitate
the spirit of the re bellion, and to arrest
'the progress of those influences which
jire more closely drawing around the
States the bonds of union and peace.
My lamented predecessor, in his proÂ­
clamation of the first of January, 1S63,
ordered and declared that all . persons
held as slaves within certain States and
parts of States therein designated were
and thenceforward should be free; aud,
further, that the executive, government
of the United States, including the mil
itary and . naval authorities thereof,
would recognize and maintain the free
dom of such persons. This guaranty
has been rendered especially obligatory
and sacred by the amendment of the
Constitution abolishing slavery through
out the United States. I therefore fully
recognize the obligation to protect and
defend that class of our people; when-
ever arid, wherever it shall become nec
essary, and to the full extent compatible

Tennant, of Kings College, to the London and

Middlesex Arelinological Society, July 7, 1858].

The Imperial State Crown of Her Majesty

Queen Victoria was made by Messrs. Rundell

and Bridge in the year 1838, with jewels taken

from old Crowns, and others furnished by coin-

mand of her Majesty. It consists of diainondis,

pearls, rubies, sapphires, and emeralds, set in

silver and gold; it has a crimson velvet cap with

ermine border, and is lined with white silk. Its

gross weight is 39 oz. 2 dwts. Troy. The lo~ver

part of the band, above the ermine border, con-

sists of a row of one hundred and twenty-nine

pearls, and the upper part of the band a

row of one hundred and twelve pearls, be-

tween which, in front of the Crown, is a

large sapphire (partly drilled,) purchased for

the Crown by his Majesty King George the

Fourth. At the back is a sapphire of smaller

size, and six other sapphires (thr~e on each

side), between which are eight emertdds. Above

and below the seven sapphires are fourteen dia-

monds, and around the eight emeralds one hun-

dred and twenty-eight diamonds. Between the

emeralds and sapphires are sixteen trefoil orna-

inents, containing one hundred and sixty dia-

monds. Above the band are eight sapphires

surmounted by eight diamonds, between which

are eight festoons consisting of one hundred and

forty-eight diamonds. In the front of the

Crown, and in the centre of a diamond Maltese

cross, is the famous ruby said to have been given

to Edward Prince of Wales, son of Edward the

Third, called the Black Prince, by Don Pedro,

King of Castile, after the battle of Najera, near

Vittoria, AD. 1367. This ruby was worn in the

helmet of Henry the Fifth at the battle of Agin-

court, S.D. 1415. It is pierced. quite through

after the Eastern custom, the upper part of the

piercing being filled up by a small ruhy. Around

this ruby, to form the cross, are seventy.fivo

brilliant diamonds. Three other Maltese crosses,

forming the two sides and back of the Crown,

have emerald centres, and contain respectively

one hundred and thirty-two, one hundred and

twenty-four, and one hundred and thirty brilliant

diamonds. Between the four Maltese crosses

are four ornaments in the form of the French

fleur-de-lis, with four rubies in the centres, and

surrounded by rose diamonds, containing res-

pectively eighty-five, eighty-six, eighty-six, and

eighty-seven rose diamonds. From the Majtese

crosses issue four imperial arches composed of

oak leaves and acorns; the leaves containing

seven hundred and twenty-eight rose, table, and

brilliant diamonds; thirty-two pearls forming

the acorns, set in cups containing fifty-four rose

diamonds and one table diamond. The total

number of diamonds in the arches and acorns is

one hundred and eight brilliant, one hundred

and sixteen table, and five hundred and fifty-

nine rose diamonds. From the upper part of the

arches are suspended four large pendant pear-

shaped pearls, with rose diamond caps, contain-

ing twelve rose diamonds, and stems containing

twenty-four very small rose diamonds. Above

the arch stands the mound, containing in the

lower hemisphere three hundred and four bril-

liants, and in the upper two hundred and forty-

four brilliants; the zone and arc being compos~d

of thirty-three rose diamonds. The cross on the

summit has a rose-cut sapphire in the centre,

surrounded by four large brilliants, aild one

hundred and eight smaller brilhiants. Summary

of jewels comprised in the Crown: I large ruby

irregularly polished, 1 large broad-spread sap-

phire, 16 sapphires, 1/ emeralds, 4 rubies, 1,363

brilliant diamonds, 1,273 rose diamonds, 147

table diamonds, 4 drop-shaped pearls, 273 pearls.

Although only nineteen members fifteen

monious display of partisan feeling. During
the io' ht of the excitement the Jie waa
passed between Mr. Brumm ( rep. , Pa. ) and
Mr. Bartlett ( dem. . Ga. ) , and a disgraceful
scene followed that almost descended to the
level of a free fight. Mr. Bartlett hurled a
book at bis adversary , and in a minute halt,
-hundred members were fighting like
fiends. j
Order wee finally restored , and later tbe
two members found the altercation had *
arisen out of a mieudenrstanding , whereÂ­
upon there were mutual apologies.
later in the proceedings the jk ker was

mcastrating agaiost whet he termed ""the ;

Only forty mtautei were given for debate,
and a special rule was required to get the
resolution before the house.
The minority resolution , which declares
for the recognition of the existing govern-

The Secret

of Health
The health of the whole body depends
upon the blood and nerves. Therefore the
medicine that expels impurities from the
blood and supplies the necessary materials
for rapidly rebuilding wasted nerve tissues,
reaches the root of many serious diseases.
It is these virtues that have given

their wonderful power to conquer dis

ease, and caused the miraculous cures that
have startled the scientific world. Thousands

of cases have demonstrated that this remedy is
an unfailing specific for such diseases as locomotor

ataxia, partial paralysis, St. Vitus' dance, sciatica, neuralgia, rheumatism,
nervous headache, the after-effects of the grip, palpitation cf the heart, pale
and sallow complexions, all forms of weakness either in male or female.

As Submitted to the Lawmakers of the Nation in Congress

/ WASHINGTON. Dec. s.â€”The President
""swot to Congress the following message:
To the Senate and House Of Represents,Â­
fives: Notwithstanding the added burdens
rendered uecessury by the war, our people
rejoice iv a very satisfactory and steadily inÂ­
creasing degree of prosperity, evidenced by
the largest volume of business ever recordÂ­
ed. Every manufacture has been productive,
agricultural pursuits have yielded abundant
returns, labor in the fields of industry is betÂ­
ter rewarded, revenue legislation passed by
the present Congress has increased the treasÂ­
ury's receipts to the amoiinl estimated by
its authorities, the finances of the governÂ­
ment have been successfully administered
nnd its credit advanced to the first rank,
while its currency has been at tho world's
highest standard.
Military service under a common flag and
for a righteous cause has strengthened the
national spirit and served to cement more
closoly than ever the fraternal bonds beÂ­
tween every section of the country. A reÂ­
view of the relations of the I'nited States
to other powers, always appropriate, is in
this year of primary importance, in view of
the momentous issues which have arisen, deÂ­
manding in one instance the ultimate deÂ­
termination by arms and involving far reachÂ­
ing consequences which require the earÂ­
nest attention of the Congress.
WAR WITH SPAIN
A Brief Resume of Its Causes and
Effects
In my last annual message very full considÂ­
eration was given to the question of the
duty of the government of the United States
towarel Spain and the Cuban insurrection,
as being by far the most important probÂ­
lem with which we were culled upon to
deal. The considerations then advanced,
and the exposition of the views therein
expressed, disclosed my sense of the extreme
gravity of the situation. Setting aside, as
logically unfounded, or practically inadmisÂ­
sible, the recognition of the Cuban insurÂ­
gents as belligerents, the recognition of the
independence of Cuba, neutral intervention
to end the war by imposing a ratified comÂ­
promise between the conn-itii'its, tntervi nÂ­
tion in favor of one or the other party and
the forcible annexation ol the inland. I con
eluded it was honestly due to our friendly
relations with Spain that she should be

Assembled at Washington

| given a reasonable chance to realize her ex-
I pectatious of reform to which she had be-
I come irrevocably committed. Withiita few
weeks previously she had announced comÂ­
| prchensivc plans which, it was conlidcntlv
asserted. would be efficacious to remedy the
evil so deeply affecting our own country, so
injurious to the true interests of the mother
country, as well as to those of Cuba, und
so repugnant to the universal sentiment of
humanity.
The ensuing months brought little sign of
real progress toward the pacification of CuÂ­
ba. Ihe autonomist administration set up
in the capital and sonic of the principal citÂ­
ies appeared not to gain the favor of the inÂ­
habitants, nor. to be able to extend their inÂ­
llueiice to the large extent of territory held
by the insurgents, while the military arm
Obviously unable to cope with the still active
rebellion, continued many of the most obÂ­
jectionable and offensive policies of the govÂ­
ernment that had preceded it. No tangible
relief was afforded the vast numbers of unÂ­
happy reconoentrndos, despite the reiterated
professions maris in that regard, and the
amount appropriated by Spain to that end.
Ihe proffered expedient of zones of cultiÂ­
vation proved illusory indeed. No less pracÂ­
tical nor mpre.delusive promises of succor
could well have been tendered to the exÂ­
hausted and destitute people, stripped of all
that made life and home dear and herded in
a strange region among unsympathetic stranÂ­
gers hardly less necessitous than themselves.
By the end of December the mortality
among them had frightfully increased ConÂ­
servative estimates from Spanish sources
placed the deaths among these di-trosed
peop.c at over fo per cent from the time
of General \\ eyler s decree of reconcentraÂ­
tion was enforced. With the acquiescence
of the Spanish authorities a scheme was
adopted for relief by charitable contribuÂ­
tions raised in (his country and distributed
under direction of the Consul-General and
the several Consuls, by noble and earnest
individual effort through the organized
agencies of the lied Cross.
Thousands of lives were thus saved, but
many thousand more were inaccessible to
such forms of aid.
The war contir.iutd on the old footing
without comprehensive plan, developing
only the same spasmodic encounters, barren
of strategic result, that had marked the
courses of the earlier ten-years' rebellion
as well ns the present insurrection from its
istart. No alternative save physical exÂ­

haushon of either combatants and there-
Witha the practical ruin of the island, latÂ­
in sight, but how far distant no one could
venture to conjecture.

DESTRUCTION OE THE MAIN X
At this juncture, on the 15th of FebruÂ­
ary last, occurred the destructioÃŸ of the
battleship Maine, while rightfully lying in
the harbor ot Havana, on a mission of inÂ­
ternational courtesy and good will, a cataÂ­
strophe the suspicious nature and horror
| of which stirred the nation's heart profoundÂ­
| ly. It is a striking evidence of the poise
| and sturdy good sense distinguishing our
! national character that this shocking blow
j falling upon a generous people, already deepÂ­
ly touched by preceding event.- in* Cuba,
| did not move them to a desperate resolve
Ito tolerate no longer the existence of a conÂ­
dition of danger and disorder at our doors
that made possible such a deed by whomsoÂ­
ever wrought. Yet, the instinct of justice
prevailed, and the nation anxiously awaited
the result of the searching investigation at
once set on foot. The finding of the naval
board of inquiry established that the origin
Of the explosion was external, by a mbÂ­
roarine mine, and only halted through lack
of positive testimony to fix the responsibilÂ­
ity of its authorship.
All those things carried conviction to
the most thoughtful, even before the findÂ­
ing of the naval court, that a cri-i.. in our
affairs with Spain and toward Cuba was at
hand. So strong was the belief, that it
needed but a brief executive suggestion to
Congress for it, to give immediate answer
lo the duty of making in.-tant provision for
the possible and perhaps speedily probable
emergency of war, and the remarkable, alÂ­
most unique, spectacle was presented of a
unanimous vole of both Houses on the 9th
of March, appropriating fifty million dolÂ­
lars, ""for the national defense and lor each
and every purpose connected therewith, to
be expended at the discretion of the PresiÂ­
llfiril ""

That this act of provision came not too
soon was disclosed when the application of
the fund was undertaken. Our forts were
pinotically undefended. Our navy needed
large provision for increased ammunition
and supplies and even numbers, to cope
with any sudden attack from the navy of
Spain, which comprised modern vessels of
the highest type of continental perfection.
Our army also required enlargement of
men and munitions. The details of the hurÂ­
ried preparation for the dread contingency
is told in the reports of the secretaries of
war and of the navy and need not be reÂ­
peated here. Jt is sufficient to say that
the outbreak of war, when it did come,
found cur nation not unprepared to meet
the conflict.
Nor was the apprehension of coming strife
confined to our own country. It war. felt
by the continental powers, who, on April
6th, through their ambassadors and envoys,
addressed to the executive an expression of
hope that humanity and moderation might
mark the course of this government and
people, and that further negotiations would
lead to an attempt, which, while securing
the maintenance of peace, would affirm all
necessary guarantees for the re-establishÂ­
ment of order in Cuba. In responding to
that presentation, I also shared the hope
that the envoys had expressed, that peace
might be preserved in a manner to termiÂ­
nate the chronic condition of disturbance in
Cuba, so injurious and menacing to our inÂ­
terests and tranquillity, as well as shocking
to our sentiments of humanity; and, while
appreciating the humanitarian and disinÂ­
terested character of the communication
they had made on behalf of the bowers, I
stated ihe confidence of this government on
its part, that equal appreciation would be
shown for its earnest and unselfish endeavÂ­
ors to ftillfill a duty of humanity by ending a
situation the indefinite prolongation of
which had become insufferable.
NEGOTIATION FAIEB
Still animated by the hoi c of a peaceful
solution and obeying the dictates of duty,
no effort was relaxed to bring about a
speedy ending of the Cuban struggle. NeÂ­
gotiations to this effect continued actively
with the government of Spain looking to
the immediate conclusion of a six months
armistice in Cuba with a view to effecting
the recognition of her people's right to in""
dependence. Besides this, the instant reÂ­
version of the order of reconsideration was

asked, so that the suffering returning to
their homes antf aided by united American
and Spanish effort, might be put iv a wav
to support themselves and, by orderly reÂ­
sumption of the well nigh destroyed'proÂ­
ductive energies of the island, contribute to
the restoration of its tranquillity and well
being. Negotiations continued for some litÂ­
tle time at Madrid, resulting in oilers by the
Spanish government which could not but l-e
regarded as inadequate, it was proposed to I
confide the preparation of peace to the inÂ­
sular parliament jet to be convened under
the autonomous decrees ol November, 1807
but without impairment in any wise of the
constitutional powers of the Madrid gov- 1
eminent, which to that end would grant an
armistice, if solicited by the insurgents, for '
such time as the general in chief might sec
fit to fix. How and with what scope of div
cretionary powers the insular parliament
was expected to set about the ""preparation""
of peace, did not appear. If it was to be by ;
negotiations with insurgents, the issue
seemed to rest on the one side with a body
chosen by that faction Of tin electors m
the districts, under Spanish control, and
on the other with the insurgent population '
holding the interior country, until repre- j
Mined in the so-called parliament and deÂ­
fiant at tin1 suggestion of sueing for peace.
Grieved aud disappointed at this barren '
outcome of my sine-ere endeavors to reach
a practicable solution ,1 felt it my duty to !
remit the whole question to tin- t'ongi'ess. ,
In the message of April 11,1898, I announced
that with this last overture in the direction
of immediate peace in Cuba and it- disapÂ­
pointing reception by Spain, the effort of !
the Executive was brought to an end. 1 again
reviewed the alternative pourse ot action '
which 1 had prepared, concluding that the i
only consonant with international policy a:.(|
computable with our firmest set historical I j
traditions was intervention as a neutraltol]
stop the war and check the hopeless saori-j!
lice of life, even though that resort involved j '
""hostile constraint upon both the parti-s to â€¢
the contract, as well as to enforce a truce' '
as to guide the eventual settlement.""
Tha grounds justifying thai step were the '
interest's of humanity; the duty to protect [
life and property of our < itizens in Cuba;the 11
right to protect our commerce, and, nnâ€ž;
important, the need of removing at once and '
forever the constant menace and tlie burÂ­
dens entailed upon our government by the

PRESIDENT WILLIAM M'KINLEY

uncertainties and perils of the situation
caused by the unendurable disturbance in
Cuba. I said:
""The long trial has proved that the obÂ­
ject for which Spain has waged the war
cannot be attained. The fire of insurrecÂ­
tion may flame or may smoulder with varyÂ­
ing seasons, but it has not been and it is plain
it cannot be extinguished by the present
methods. The only hope of relief and reÂ­
pose from a situation which can no longer
be endured is the enforced pacification of
Cuba. In the name of humanity, in the
name of civilization, in behalf of endangered
American interests, which give us tlie right
and duly to speak and to act, the war in
Cuba must stop.""
In view of all this, the Congress was asked
to authorize pad empower the President to
take measures to secure a full and final terÂ­
mination of hostilities between Spain and
the people of Cuba, and to secure in the isÂ­
land the establishment of a stable governÂ­
ment, capable of maintaining order and
observing its international obligations,""inÂ­
suring peace and tranquillity anil
proper treatment of its citizens as
well as our own, and for the
accomplishment of those ends to authorÂ­
ize the military and naval forces of the UnitÂ­
ed States, as might be necessary, with added
authority to continue generous relief to the
starving people of Cuba.
ACTION OF CONGRESS

The response of the Congress, after nine
days of earnest deliberation, during which
the almost unanimous sentiment of your
body was developed on every point save as
to the expediency of coupling the prepared
action with a formal recognition of the reÂ­
public of Cuba as the true and lawful govÂ­
ernment of that islandâ€”a proposition which
failed o, adoptionâ€”the Congress, after conÂ­
ference, on the 10th of April, by a votcof
42 to 35 in the Semite and .'lll to 6 in the
House of Representatives, passed the memÂ­
orable joint resolution saying:
""Firstâ€”That the people of the island of
Cuba, are, and by right, ought lo be free
and independent.
""Secondâ€”That it is the duty of the I'nited
States and the government of the United
States hereby demand that the government
of Spain at once relinquish its authority in
the island of Cuba and withdraw its land
and naval forces from Cuban and Cuban
waters.
""Thirdâ€”That the President ofthe United
States be and is hereby directed and emÂ­
powered to use the entire land and naval,

forces of the United States, the miJitia of
the several States to such extent as may he
necessary to carry thÂ».ie resolutions into
effect.
""Fourthâ€”That the United States hereby
disclaims any disposition or intention to exÂ­
ercise sovereignty, jurisdiction or control
over said island, except for the pacification
thereof and asserted its determination lhat
when that is accomplished, to leave the
government and control of the island to its
people.""
This resolution was approved","unknown"
"616","1417000","was carried in the following form :-"" Until Parliament otherwise provides, the qualification of the electors of members of the House of Representatives shall be in each State that which is prescribed by the law of the State as the qualification for the electors of the more numerous House of Parliament of the State, provided that in the choosing of such members no elector shall vote more than once."" The proposal to adopt an adult suffrage was defeated by 19 to 4, and one man one vote was lost by 15 to 8. The intervening clauses having been postponed, the committee considered the provision dealing with electoral divisions. It was eventually agreed to thus :-"" Until Parliament otherwise provides, the electoral divisions of the several States for the purpose of returning members of the House, of Representatives and the number of members to be chosen for the electoral division shall be determined from time to time by the Parliaments of the several States, and until so determined each State shall constitute an electoral division."" The Governor-General's salary was fixed at Â£10,000 per annum. A discussion then took place as to the qualifications of the members of the House of Representatives. The clause provides that he must be of the full age of 21 years, and must when elected be an elector entitled to vote in some State, or a person qualified to become such elector at the election of members of the House of Representatives, and must have been for three years at least resident within the limits of the Commonwealth as existing at the time when he is elected. He must be either a. natural-boru subject of the Queen or a subject of the Queen naturalised.

to the rights belonging to his rank and station. In ti
view
of these important principles, it is with deep morÂ­ w
lification
and regret I announce to you that, during the gi
axcitement
growing cut of the executions at Havana, 8
the
office of her Catholic majesty's consul at New OrÂ­
leans
was assailed by a mob, his property destroyed,
the
Spanish flag found in the office carried off and torn T
in
pieces, and he himselfinduced to flee for his personÂ­
il safety, which he supposed to be in danger. On reÂ­ O
ceiving
intelligence of these events, I forthwith directed T
the attorney of the United States residing at New OrÂ­ O
leans
to inquire into the facts and the extent of the peÂ­
,uniary loss sustained by the consul, with the intention F
f laying them before you, that you might make provisÂ­ S
on for such indemnity to him as a just regard for the
honor
of the nation and the respect which is due to a
rriendly power might, in your judgment, seem to reÂ­ or
aire. The correspondence upon this subject between ai
he Secretary of State and her Catholic majesty's tt
,inister plenipotentiary is herewith transmited. a
The occurrence at New Orleans has led me to give 2
my
attention to the state of oeotiwu ie resard to foreign
ambassadors,
ministers, and consuls. 1 think the legis. is
lation
of the country is deficient in not providing aiufÂ­ c
ciently either for the protection or the punishment of
consuls.
I therefore recommendthe subject to the conÂ­ at
ideration of Congress.
Your attention is again invited to the question of reciÂ­
procal
trade between the United States and Canada and $


other British possessions near our aronter. uverures
for a convention upon this subject have been received g
from her Britannic Majesty's Minister Plenipotentiary, si
but it seems to be in many respects preferable that the
matter should be regulated by reciprocal legislation. p
Documents are laid before you showing the terms which fi
the British government is willing to offer, and the meaÂ­ sl
sures which it may adopt, if some arrangement upon ti
this subject shall not be mada. o
From the accompanying copy of a note from theBritÂ­
ish Legation at Washington, and the reply of the DeÂ­ ti
partment of State thereto, it will appear that her BriÂ­ f1
tannic Majesty's government is desirous that a part of 11
the boundary line between Oregon and the British posÂ­ ti
sessions should be authoritatively marked out, and that p
an intention wrb expressed to apply to Congress for an p
appropriation to defray the expense thereof on the part '
of the United States. Your attention to this subject is (
accordingly invited, and a proper appropriation recomÂ­ a
mended.
A convention for the adjustment of claims of citizens e
of the United States against Portugal has been concludÂ­ r:
ed, and the ratifications have been exchanged. The a
first instalment of the amount to be paid by Portugal tl
fell due on the 30th of September last, and has been b
paid. $
The President of the French republic, according to p
the provisions of the convention, has been selected as (
arbiter in the case of the General Armstrong; and has r
signified that be accepts the trust and the high satisfacÂ­
tion he feels in acting as the common friend of two na. a
tions, with which France is united by sentiments of sinÂ­ t
cere and lasting amity.
The Turkish government has expressed its thanks for v
the kind reception given to the Sultan's agent, Amin F
Boy, on the occasion of his recent visit to the United a
States. On the 28th of February last a despatch was t
addressed by the Secretary of State to Mr. Marsh, the
American Minister at Constantinople, instructing him to y
ask of the Turkish government permission for the Hun. -
garians, then. imprisoned within the dominions of the c
Sublime Porte, to remove to this country. On the Sd t
of March last both Houses of Congress passed a resolaÂ­
tion requesting the President to authorize the employÂ­
ment of a public vessel to convey to this country Louis
Kossath and his associates in captivity.
The instruction above referred to was complied with, t
and the Turkish government having released Governor I
Kossuth and his companions from prison, on the IOth
of September last they embarked on board of the UnÂ­ i
ited States steam-frigate Mississippi, which was selected
to carry into effect the resolution of Congress. GoverÂ­ I
nor Kossuth left the Mississippi at Gibraltar, for the
purpose of making a visit to England, and may shortly I
be expected in New York. By communications to the c
Department of State he has expressed his grateful acÂ­
knowledgments for the interposition of this Government
in behalf of himself and his associates. This country f
has been justly regarded as a safe asylum for those I
whom polical events have exiled from their own homes
in Europe; and it is recommended to Congress to conÂ­ r
eider in what manner Governor Kossath and his comÂ­
panions, brought hither by its authority, shall be receiv.
ed and treated.
It is earnestly to be hoped that the differences which r
have for some time past been pending between the gaovÂ­
ernment of the French republic and that of the SandÂ­ r
wich Islands, may be peaceably and durably adjusted,
so as to secure the independence of those islands.
Long before the events which have of late imparted so t
much Importance to the possessions of the United States t
on the Pacific, we acknowledged the independence of F
the Hawaiian government. This Government was first
in taking that step, and several of the leading powers of a
Europe immediately followed. We were influenced n f
this measure by the existing and prospective importance
of the islands as a place of refuge and refreshment for f
our vessels engaged in the whale fishery, and by the
consideration that they lie in the course of the great t
trade which must, at no distant day, be carried on beÂ­ f
tween the western coast of North America and Eastern t
Asia. t
We were also influenced by a desire that those isÂ­ g
lands should not pass under the control of any other F
great maritime State, but should remain in an indepenÂ­ a
dent condition, and so be accessibleand useful to the comÂ­ c
merce of all nations. I need not say that the imporÂ­ 1i
tance of these considerations has been greatly enhanced t
by the sudden and vast development which the interests t
of the United States have attained in California and I
Oregon; and the policy heretofore adopted in regard to I
those islands will be steadily pursued.
It is gratifying not only to those who consider the a
commercial interests of nations, but also to all who faÂ­ c
vor the progress of knowledge and the diffusion of reÂ­ c
ligion, to see a community emerge from a savage state
and attain such a degree of civilization in those distant c
geas. e
It is much to be deplored that the internal tranquiliÂ­
ty of the Mexican republic should again be seriously c
disturbed; for, since the peace between that republic f
and the United States, it had enjoyed such.comparaÂ­
tive repose that the most favorable anticipations for the I
future might, with a degree of confidence, have been
indulged. These, however, have been thwarted by
the recent outbreak in the State of' Tamaulipae, on the
right bank of the Rio Bravo. Having received inforÂ­
mation that persons from the United States hlad taken
part in the insurrection, and apprehending that their
example might be followed by Qthers, I caused orders I
to be tusued for the purpose of preventing any hostile
expeditions against Mexico from being set on footin viÂ­
olation of the laws of the United States.
â€¢ I likewise is.
sned a proclamation upon theeunbject, a copy of which
is herewith laid before you. This appeared to be renÂ­
dered imperative by the obligations of treatie and the
*general4atije. ofgood neighbborhood.
In my last annual messga l iformed Congress tht
citizens of the United States had undertaken the conÂ­
uniou of the two ocaD5 by meana of a railroad aczrog

 the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, under a grant of the, MexÂ­
ican government to a citizen of that republic; and that
this enterprise would probably be prosecuted with enÂ­
ergy whenever Mexico should consent to such stipulaÂ­
tions with the government of the United Stales as
should impart a feeling of security to those who should
invest their property in the enterprise.
A convention between the two governments for the
accomplishment of that end, has been ratified bylthis
Government, and only awaits the decision of the ConÂ­
gress and the Executive of that republic.
Some unexpected difficulties and delays have arisen
in the ratification of that convention by Mexico, but it
is to be presumed that her decision will be governed by
just and enlightened views, as well of the general
importance of the object, as of her own interests and
obligations.
In negotiating noon this important subject, this
Government has had in view one, and only one,
object. That object has been, and is, the construcÂ­
tion or attainment of a passage from ocean to ocean,
the shortest and the best for travellers and merÂ­
chandize, and equally open to all the world. It
has sought to obtain no territorial acquisition, nor any
advantages peculiar to itself; and it would see, with
the greatest regret, that Mexico should oppose any obÂ­
stacle to the accomplishment of an enterprise which
promises so much convenience to the whole commerÂ­
cial world, and such eminent advantages to Mexico
herself. Impressed with these sentiments and these
convictions, the Government will continue to exert all
proper efforts to bring about the necessary arrangeÂ­
ment with the republic of Mexico for the speedy comÂ­
pletion of the work.
For some months past, the republic of Nicaragua has
been the theatre of one of those civil convulsions, from
which the causepgf free institutions, and the general
prosperity aundsocial progress of the States of Central
America, have so often and so severely suffered. Until
quiet shall have been restored, and a government appaÂ­
rently stable shall have been organized, no advance can
prudently be made in disposing of the questions pendÂ­
ing between the two countries.
I am happy to announce that an inter-oceanic comÂ­
munication from the month of the St. John to the PaÂ­
cific has been so far accomplished, as that passengers
have actually traversed it, and merchandise has been
transported over it; and when the ca-al shall have been
completed, according to the original plan, the means of
communication will be further improved.
It is understood that a considerable part of the railÂ­
road across the Isthmus of Panama has been comÂ­
preted, and that the mail and passengers will in future
be conveyed thereon. f
Whichever of the several routes between the two
oceans may ultimately prove most eligible for travellers
to and from the different States on the Atlantic and
Gulf of Mexico and our coast on the Pacific, there is
little reason to doubt that all of them will be useful to
the public, and will liberally reward that individual enÂ­ r
terprise by which alone they have been or are expected t
to be carried into effect.
Peace has been concluded between the contending e
parties in the island of St. Domingo, and it is hoped,
upon a durable basis. Such is the extent of our comÂ­
mercial relations with that island, that the United c
states cannot fail to feel a strong interest in its tranÂ­ c
quility.
The office of Commissioner to China remains unfilled; u
several persons have been appointed, and the place has t
been offered to others, all of whom have declined its a
acceptance, on the ground of the inadequacy of the t
compensation. The annual allowance by law is six a
thousand dollars, and there is no provision for any outÂ­ t
fit. I earnestly recommend the consideration of this t
subject to Congress. Our commerce with China is highÂ­ a
ly important, and is becoming more and more so, in v
consequence of the increasing intercourse between our (
ports on the Pacific coast and Eastern Asia. China is d
understood to be a country in which living is very exÂ­ r
pensive, and I know of no reason why the American n
Commissioner sent thither should not be placed, in reÂ­ p
gard to compensation, on an equal footing with minisÂ­ v
ters who represent this country at the courts of EuÂ­ ii
rope. t.
By reference to the Report of the Secretary of the f
Treasury,
it will be seen that the aggregate receipts for a
the
last fiscal year amounted to $52,312,979 87; which, a
with the balance in the Treasury on the 1st July, 1850,
gave, as the available means for the year, the sum of a
$58,917,524 36. d
The total expenditures for the same period were d
$48,005,878 68.

were........... ...... .... ... 215,725,995 r

Since the 1st of December last the payments in cash (
on
account of the public debt, exclusive of interest, have s
amounted
to $7,501,456 56; which, however, includes
ithe
sum of $8,242,400 paid under the 12th article of a
the treaty with tvexico, and the further sum of $2591.
213 45, being.the amount of a,,a.
,, American ciiÂ­ I
zens under tue late treaty with Mexico, for which the
iseagobf stock was authorized, but which was paid in
cash hrom the Treasury.
Tiie public debt on the 20th ultimo, exclusive of the
stock authorized to be issued to Texas by the act of 9th
September, 1850, was $62,560,395 26.
The receipts for the next fiscal year are estimated at
$51,800,000, which, with the probable unappropriated


u n1 aI UG u ill u rnl I[ i Ol U ty , V u L W .V 44 d u "" ' .
give, as the probable available means for that year, the
sum of $63,258,743 09.
It has been deemed proper, in view of the large exÂ­
penditures consequent upon the acquisition of territory t
from Mexico, that the estimates for the next fiscal year
should be laid before Congress in such manner as to disÂ­
tinguish the expenditures so required from the otherwise
ordinary demands upon the Treasury.
The total expenditures for the next fiscal year are esÂ­
timated at $42,892,299 19, of which there is required a
for the ordinary purposes of the Government, other than
those consequent upon the acquisition of our new TerriÂ­ t
tories, and deducting the payments on account of the
public debt, the sum of $33,843,198 08; and for the i
purposes connected directly or indirectly with those
Territories, and in the fulfilment of the obligations of the
I
Government, contracted in consequence of their acquiÂ­ I
sitlon, the sum of $9,549,101 11
If the views of the Secretary of the Treasury in refÂ­
erence to the expenditures required for these TerritoÂ­
ries shall be met by corresponding action on the part
of Congress, and appropriations made in accordance
therewith, there will be an estimated unappropriated t
balance in the Treasury on the 30th June, 1853, of
,
$20,866,443 90, wherewith to meet that portion of the
!
public debt due on the 1st July following, amounting to
$6,237,931 35, as well as any appropriations which
may be made beyond the estimates.
In thus referring to the estimated expenditures on I
account of our newly acquired territories, I may express t
the hope that Congress will concur with me in the deÂ­
j
sire that a liberal course of policy may be pursued toÂ­
wards them, and that every obligation, express or imÂ­ F
plied, entered into in consequence of their acquisition, t
shall be fulfilled by the most liberal appropriations for
that purpose. t
The values of our domestic exports for the last fiscal
j
year, as compared with those of the previous year, exÂ­ t
hibit an increase of $48,646,322. At first view this
condition of our trade with foreign nations would seem
to present the most flattering hopes of its future prosÂ­
perity. An examination of the details of our exports,
however, will show that the increased value of our exÂ­
ports for the last fiscal Jyear, is to be found in the high t
price of cotton which prevailed during the first half of t
that year, which price has since declined about oneÂ­
half.
The value of our exports of breadstuffs and provisÂ­
ions, which it was supposed the incentive of a low tarÂ­
iffand large importations from abroad would have
greatly augmented, has fallen from $68,701,921, in
1847, to $26,051,373 in 1850, and to $21,948,653 in
1851, with a strong probability, amounting almost to a
certainty, of a still further reduction in the current
year.
The aggregate values of rice exported during the last
fiscal year, as compared with the previous year, also exÂ­ I
hibit a decrease amounting to $460,917, which, with a
decline in the values of the exports of tobacco for the
same period, make an aggregate decrease in these two
articles of $1,156,751.
The policy which dictated a low rate of duties on
foreign merchandise, it was thought by those who proÂ­
moted and established it, would tend to benefit the farÂ­
ming population of this country, by increasing the deÂ­
mand and raising the price of agricultural products in
foreign markets.
The foregoing facts, however, seem to show inconÂ­
testibly that no such result hasfollowed the adoption of
this policy. On the contrary, notwithstanding the reÂ­
peal of the restrictive corn laws in England, the foreign
demand for the products of the American farmer has
steadily declined, since the short crops and consequent
famine in a portion of Europe have been happily reÂ­
placed by full crops and comparative abundance of
food.
It will be seen by recurring to the commercial statisÂ­
tics for the past year, that the value of our domesticexÂ­
ports has been increased in the single item of raw cotÂ­
ton by $40,000,000 over the value of that export for
the year preceding. This is not due to any increased
general demand for that article,but to the short crop of the
preceding year, which created an increased demand and
an augmented price for the crop of last year. Should the
cotton crop now going forward to market be only equal
In xuantity to that of the year preceding, and be sold at
the present prices, then there would be a falling off in
the value of our exports for the present fiscal year of at
least $40,000,000, compared with the amount exported
for the year ending 30th Jane, 1851.
The production of gold in California for the past year
seems to promise a large supply of that metal from that
quarter for some time to come. This large annual increase
of the currency of the world most be attended with its
usual results, These have been already partially. disÂ­
closed in the enhancement of prices and a rising spirit
of speculation and adventure, tending to over-trading,
as well at home as abroad. Unless some salutary
check shall be given to these tendencies, it is to be fearÂ­
ed that importations of foreign goods beyond a healthy
demand in this country will lead to a sudden drain of
the precious metals from us, bringing with it,as it has
done in former times, the most disastrous consequences
to the business and capital of the American people.
The exports of specie to liquidate our foreign debt
during the past fiscal year have been $24,268,979 over
the amount of specie imported. The exports of specie
during the first quarter of the present fiscal year have
been $14,651,827. Should specie continue to be ex-.
portedat this rate for the remaining three-quarters of
this year, it will drain from our metallic currency during
the year endinig 30th June, 1852, the enormots amount
of $58,607,1808.
.
In the presenit prosperous condition of the national
fioancs, it will become ibe duty of Congresp to consider
the.best mode of paying off the public debt. If the I
present airid anticipated surplis in the Treasury should
not be absorbed by appropriations of an extraordinary
charoater, this urpluae should be employed in auch way,

 and under each restrictions, as Congre~c
many enact, in
extinguishing the outstanding debt of the nation.
By reference to the act of Congress approved 9th
September, 1850, it will be seen that, in consideration
of certain concessions by the State of Texas, it is proÂ­
vided that the ""United States shall pay to the State of
Texas the sum of ten millions of dollars, in a stock
bearing five per cent. interest, and redeemable at the
end of fourteen years, the interest payable half yearly,
at the Treasury of the United States ""
In the same section of the law it is further provided,
""that no more than five millions of said stock shall be
issued until the creditors of the State holding bonds and
other certificates of stock of Texas, for which duties on
imports were specially pledged, shall first file, at the
Treasury of the United States, releases of all claims
against the United States, for or on account of said
bonds or certificates, in such form as shall be prescribed
by the Secretary of the Treasury, and approved by the
President of the United States ""
The form of release thus provided for has been preÂ­
scribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, andnapproved.
It has been published m all the leading newspapers in
the commercial cities of the United States, and all perÂ­
sons holding claims of the kind specified in the foregoing
proviso were required to file their releases (in the form
thus prescribed) in the Treasury of the United States,
on or before the 1st day of October, 1851. Although
this publication has been continued from the 25th day
of March, 1851, yet up to the 1st of October last comÂ­
paratively few releases had been filed by the creditors
of Texas.
The authorities of the State of Texas, at the request
of the Secretary of the Treasury, have furnished a scheÂ­
dale of the public debt of that State created prior to her
admission into the Union, with a copy of the laws under
which each class was contracted.
I have, from the documents furnished by the State of
Texas, determined the classes of claims which in my
judgment fall within the provisions of the act of ConÂ­
gress of the 9th of September, 1850.
On being officially informed of the acceptance by
Texas of the propositions contained in the act referred
to, I caused the stock to be prepared, and the five milÂ­
lions which are to be issued unconditionally, bearing
an interest of 5 per cent, from the 1st day of January,
1851, have been for some time ready to be delivered to
the State of Texas. The authorities of Texas, up to
the present time, have not authorized any one to reÂ­
ceive this stock, and it remains in the Treasury DeÂ­
partment, subject to the order of Texas.
The releases, required by law to he deposited in the
Treasury, not having been filed there, the remaining
five millions have not been issued. This last atnount
of the stock will be withheld from Texas until the con
ditions upon which it is to be delivered shall be com
plied with by the creditors of that State, unless Con
greoss shall otherwise direct by a modification of the law.
In my last annual message, to which I respectfully
refer, I stated briefly the reasons which induced me
to recommend a modification of the present tariff, by
converting the ad valorem into a specific duty, wherÂ­
ever the article imported was of such a character as to
permit it, and that such a discrimination should be
made, in favor of the industrial pursuits of our own
country, as to encourage home production without exÂ­
cluding foreign competition.
The numerous frauds which continue to be practised
upon the revenue, by false invoices and undervaluaÂ­
tions, constitute an unanswerable reason for adopting
specific instead of ad valorem duties in all cases where
the nature of the commodity does not forbid it, A
striking illustration of these frauds will be exhibited in
the Report of the Secretary of the Treasury, showing
the Custom house valuation of articles imported under
a former law subject to specific duties, when there
was no inducement to undervaluation, and the
Custom house valuations of the same articles, unÂ­
der the present system of ad valorem duties, so greatly
reduced as to leave no doubt of the existence of the
most flagrant abuses under the existing laws. This
practical evasion of the present law, combined
with the languishing condition of some of the great
interests of the country, caused by over importaÂ­
tions and consequent depressed prices, and with the
failure in obtaining a foreign market for our increasing
surplus of breadstuffs and provisions, has induced me
again to recommend a modification of the existing tariff.
The report of the Se:retary of the Interior, which
accompanies this communication, will present a conÂ­
densed statement of the operations of that important
department of the Government.
It will be seen that the cash sales of the public lands
exceed those of the preceding year, and that there is
reason to anticipate a still further increase, notwithÂ­
standing the large donations which have been made to
many of the States, and the liberal grants to individuÂ­
als as a reward for military services. This fact furÂ­
nishes very gratifyina evid .....aÂ­ , -, ""s.
and prosperity of our country.
Suitable measures have been adopted for commencÂ­
ing the survey of the public lands in California and
Oregon. Surveying parties have been organized, and
some progress has been made in establishing the princiÂ­
pal base and meridian lines. But further legislation
and additional appropriations will be necessary before
the proper subdivisions can be made, and the general
landsystem extended over those remote parts of oar
territory.
On the 3d of March last an act was passed providing
for the appointment of three commissioners to settle
private land claims in California. Three persons were
immediately appointed, all of whom, however, declinÂ­
ed accepting the otfice, in consequence of the iade
quacy of the compensation. Others were promptly so
lected, who, for the same reason, also declined; and it


was not until late in thel season tnat tne services of
suitable persons could be secured. A majority of the
commissioners convened, in this city, on the 10th of
September last, when detailed instructions were given
to them in regard to their duties. Their first meeting
for the transaction of business will be held in San FranÂ­
cisco on the 8th day of the present month.
I have thought it proper to refer to these facts, not
only to explain the causes of the delay in filling the
commission, but to call your attention to the propriety
of increasing the compensation of the commissioners.
The office is one of great labor and responsibility, and
the compensation should be such as to command men
of a high order of talents and the most unquestionable
integrity.
The proper disposal of the mineral lands of Califor.
nia is a subject surrounded by great difficulties. In my
last annual message I recommended the survey and
sale of them in small parcels, under such restrictions
as would effectually guard against monopoly and specÂ­
ulation. But upon further information, and in deferÂ­
ence to the opinions of persons familiar wit. the subÂ­
ject, I am inclined to change that recommendation, and
to advise:that they be permitted to remain, as at presÂ­
ent, a common field, open to the enterprise and indusÂ­
try of all our citizens, until further experience shall
have developed the best policy to be ultimately adoptÂ­
ed in regard to them. It is safer to suffer the inconÂ­
veniences that now exist, for a short period, than, by
premature legislation, to fasten on the country a syse
tem founded in error, which may place the whole sub.
ject beyond the future control of Congress.
The agricultural lands should, however, be surveyed
and brought into market with as little delay as possible,
that the titles may become settled, and the inhabitants
stimulated to make permanent improvements, and enÂ­
ter on the ordinary pursuits of life. To effect these obÂ­
jects it is desirable that the necessary provision be made
by law for the establishment of land offices in California
and Oregon, and for the efficient prosecution of the surÂ­
veys at an early day.
Some difficulties have occurred in organizing the TerÂ­
ritorial governments of New Mexico and Utah; and,
when more accurate information shall be obtained of
the causes, a further communication will be made on
that subject.
In my last annual communication to ('ongress, I reÂ­
commended the establishment of an Agricultural BuÂ­
reau, and I take this occasion again to invoke your faÂ­
vorable consideration of the subject.
Agriculture may justly be regarded as the great inÂ­
terest of our people. Four-fifths of our active population
are employed in the cultivation of the soil, and the raÂ­
pid expansion of our settlements over new territory is
daily adding to the number of those engaged in that voÂ­
cation. Justice and sound policy, therefore, alike reÂ­
quire that the Government should use all the means
authorized by the Constitution to promote the interests
and welfare of that important class of our fellow-citi.
zens. And yet it is a singular fact that, whilst the
manufacturing and commercial interests have engaged
the attention of Congress during a large portion ofevery
session, and our statutes abound in provisions for their
protection and encouragement, little has yet been done
directly for the advancement of agriculture. It is time
that this reproach to our legislation should be removed;
and I sincerely hopebthat the present Congress will not
close their labors without adopting efficient means to
supply the omissions of those who have preceded thert.

collecting and disseminating correct information as to
the best modes ofcultivation, and of the mosteffectual

Tnr. Society for the Prevention of CruÂ­
"" â–  y tÂ« Animals has put forth the following
â– julesfor the treatment of balky horses,
which should command the attention of
awnera of anima's addicted to that provokÂ­
ingâ€™habit ;
1. Pat the horse upon the neck; examÂ­
ine the harness carefully, first on one side
i ml the.n on the other, speaking encouragÂ­
ingly while doing so ; and then jump into
the wagon and give the word go ; generally
he will obey.
2. A teamster in Maine says he can start
fho worst balky horse by taking him from
the shafts ai d ranking him go in a circle
â– ill he is ghldy. If the first dance of thie
sort doesn't cure him, the second will.
It. To cure a balky horse, simply place
your hand over the hor.toâ€™s nose and shut
off his wind till he wants to go, and then
tet him go.
4. The brain of the horse seems to enterÂ­
tain but one idea at a time ; therefore conÂ­
tinued whipping only confirms,his stubborn
resolve. If you can by any means give him
a new subject to think of you will generally
have no trouble in starting him. A simple
remedy is to take a couple of turns of stout
twine around tho foreleg, just below the
Knee, tight enough for the horse to feel,
and tie in a bowknoc. At the first check
he will go dancing off, and after going a
short distance you can get out and remove
the string to prevent injury to the tendon
in your farther drive.
5. Take the tail of the horse between the
hind legs and tie it with a cord to the sadÂ­
dle girth.
6. Tie a string around the horseâ€™s eat
close to lus head.
Ti.e Farmer's Uhim suggests that in folÂ­
lowing any of the above rules, that tho
manager of tho horse docs not lose his own
temper and become more balky than the
horse. It is a very common remark that
there are more balky drivers than horses.
A driver who docs not control hia own temÂ­
per will be very likely to lose control of a
balky horse","unknown"

"625","1507899","A MIRACLE IF EVER THERE WAS ONE. DAVE KIRK, AN EX.MELBOURNE CRACK BICYCLIST, LEAVES THE HOSPITAL TO DIE. SEVEN SPECIALISTS PRONOUNCED HIS CASE INCURABLE. TERRIBLE RESULT OF A FALL AT THE SCOTCH COLLEGE GROUNDS A YEAR AGO. PARALYSIS, HEMORRHAGE. SPINAL DISEASE, AND LOCOMOTOR ATAXIA. NINE MONTHS AGONY IN THE MELBOURNE HOSPITAL. NOW A HEALTHY, ACTIVE MAN. THANKS TO DR. WILLIAMS' PfNK PILLS. (From the Melbourne Advocate.) Dave Kirk, the well known and highlypopular hero of the cycle track, was, on the 8th October of last year, training in the Scotch ' College Grounds, Melbourne, when all of a sudden, and without any warning, the tire of the leader broke, and becoming at once entangled in the wheel, brought the rider to the ? ground with terrific, force. . So great was. the. impact that not a single limb or member of, the. unfortunate cyclist's frame escaped serious injury, in all haste the victim was removed to the Melbourne Hospital, more dead than alive, and quite unconscious from shock and hemorrhage. A hasty examination of the patient by tbe medical staff of that institution showed them that the case was a most serious one, and tbe grave looks of tbe surgeons in attend ance plainly indicated that they entertained but the slightest hopes of the unfortunate young man's recovery. All that the resources of that fully-plenisbed hospital could command were brought into play for the relief of the patient, but the gravest fears were felt as to his ultimate safety. Tbe external injuries were not, after all, the most serious â€” the symptoms of serious internal injury to the nervous system were all too patent to the practised and expert eye of the medical faculty. So serious, indeed was the case of Dave Kirk considered, that an eminent surgeon who called to see the patient declared it as his opinion that tbe patient would, in all probability, never rise from his sick bed. There poor t)ave lay, betwixt life and death, for about seven weary and exceedingly trying months of pain and suffering, unab*e to stir hand or foot, unable to move even from side to side â€” a victim of hemorrhage, spinal disease, pleurisy, dysentery, complete paralysis of the body, and last, but by no means least, locomotor ataxy, a fearful complaint, which utterly prostrates the human frame and destroys the power of the will; so much so that the common functions of nature are performed by a power absolutely extraneous to the will. An idea of tbe dreadful injuries sustained by tbe patient may be gathered from the following details gleaned from Kirk by our representative. His left heel had to be removed, and 32 stitches were inserted in that part of his foot, 18 being placed in the right leg. The kneecap was smashed, and had to be lifted. Altogether seven surgeons had to do with the sufferer, who was reduced to a very weak and almost comatose state after nine operations had been performed on him. Mortification set in parts of tbe lower limbs, and artificial means bad to be employed to draw off the urine. The system was washed internally four times every day with water and carbolic acid, the stomach being cleaned out by means of a tube. Injections were also largely employed. This was a most singular case, and one which must have afforded ample play for the physicians' skill and experiment, yet it remained for Dr. William' Pink Pills to effect a radical and complete cure. THE BRIGHT SIDE OF THE PICTURF. AN ASTOUNDING CHANGE. After seven months of bed-ridden existence in the Melbourne General Hospital, Dave Kirk left tbat institution with faint hopes of ever being able to get about without the aid of crutches, with all hopes vanished as to his ability to again enter the cyc)-* arena","unknown"

WASHINGTON, Dec. 1. Following is the
full text -f the President's message, read
1e
in both branches of Congress to-day :
lÂ­
To the Senate and House of RepresentaÂ­
tives:
The reports of the several executive deÂ­
partments, which will be laid before ConÂ­
gress in the usual course, will exhibit In
o
detail the operations of the Government
n
for the last fiscal year. Only the more
important incidents and results and chiefly
such as may be the foundation of the reaÂ­
o
ommendations I shall submit, will be reÂ­
v
ferred to lin this annual message. The
e vast and increasing business of the GovÂ­
a ernment has been transacted by the-several
departments during the year with faithÂ­
fulness, energy and success. The reveÂ­
nues, amounting to above four hundred
and fifty million dollars have been collectÂ­
ed and disbursed, without revealing, so
far as I can ascertain, a single case of
defalcation.
An earnest effort has been made to stimÂ­
ulatra sense of responsibility and public
duty in all officers and employes of every
grade, and the work done by them has
almost wholly escaped unfavorable critiÂ­
cism. I speak of these matters with freeÂ­
e dom because the record of this good work
is not mine, but is shared by the head of
-
the several departments with the great
body of faithful officers and employes who
serve under them. The closest scrutiny
of Congress is invited to all the methods
of administration and to every item of exÂ­
penditure.
INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES.
The friendly relations of our country
with the nations of Europe and the East
have been undisturbed, while the ties of
good will and common interest that bind
us to the States of the Western Hemisphere
have been notably strengthened by the
conference held in this Capital to consider
measures for the general welfare. PursuÂ­
ant to the invitation authorized by ConÂ­
gress the representative s of every indepepÂ­
dent States of the American continent and
of Hayti, met i' conference in this CapiÂ­
tal in October, 1889 and continued in sesÂ­
sion until the 19th of last April. -This imÂ­
portant convocation marks a most InterÂ­
esting and influential epoch in the history
of the Western Hemispherd. It is noteÂ­
worthy that Brazil invited while under-an
imperial form of government shared as a
republic in the deliberations and results of
the conference. The recommendations of
this conference were all transmitted to
Congress at the last session.
The International Marine Conference
which sat at Washington last winter reachÂ­
ed a very gratifying result. The resoluÂ­
tloi.s suggested have been brought to the
attention of all the governments representÂ­
ed and their general adoption is confidentÂ­
ly expected. The legislation of Congress
at the last session is in conformity with
the propositions of the conference and the
proclamaron therein provided for will be
issued when the other powers have given
notice of their adhesion.
STATE OF THE CONGO.
The conference of Brussels to devise
means for suppressing the slave trade in
Africa afforded an oppoztunity for a new
expression of the interest the American
people feel in that great work. It soon
became evident the measure proposed
would tax the resources of the Congo beÂ­
yond the revenues available under the
general act of Berlin of 1881, and the
United States not being a party to that
act, could not share in Its revision, but by
a separate act the independent state of the
Congo was freed from restrictions upon a
customs revenue. The demoralizing and
destructive traffic in ardent spirits among
the tribes--also claimed the earnest attenÂ­
tion of the conference and the delegates of
the United States were foremost in advoÂ­
cating measures for its suppression. An
accord was reached the-influence of which
will be very helpful andÂ­ extend -over a
wide region. As soon as the measures
shall receive the sanction of the NetherÂ­
lands, for a time withheld, the general
acts will be submitted for ratification by
the Senate. Meanwhile negotiations have
been opened for a new and complete treaty
of friendship, commerce and navigation
between the United States and the lndeÂ­
pendent state of the Congo. -
THE YOUNG REPUBLIC.
Toward the end of: the past year the
only independent tmonarchial government
on the Western Continent, thatÂ­ of Brazil,
ceased to exist and was succeeded -by a
republic. Diplomatic relations were at I
once established with the new governmetit,' I
but it was not completely recognized until 1
an opportunity had been affordedÂ­ to I
ascertain that It had popular approval and I
support. When the course of .events l
had yielded assurance of this fact no time I
was lost in extendoing to_ the new governÂ­ I
ment a full and cordial welcome Into the i
family of American Commonwealths.
- It 1
is confidently believed that 'the =ood I
relations: of the two countries will be I
preserved and that the:future will witness




 an Increased intimacy of intercourse-and
an expansion of their mutnal commerce.
THS PEACE OF CENTRAL AMERICA
has again been disturbed through a revoÂ­
lutionary change. Salvador was not re.
S onized by the other States and hostilities
broke out between Salvador -and tuateÂ­
mala, threatening to involve all Central
America in conflict and to undo the progÂ­
ress which had.been made toward a union
of their interests.. The efforts of this GovÂ­
ernment were promptly and zealously exÂ­
erted to compose their differences, and
through the active efforts of the RepresenÂ­
tative of the United States a provisional
treaty of peace... was signed August 96,
whereby the right of the Republic of SalÂ­
vador to choose its own ruler was recogÂ­
nized. - General Ezeta, the chief of theÂ­
provisional government, has since been
confirmed In the presidency by the assemÂ­
bly and diplomatic recognition duly folÂ­
lowed.
THE KILLING OF GEN. BARRUNDIA
on board the Pacific mail steamer AcapulÂ­
co, while anchored in transit, in harbor at
St. Jose de Guatemala, demanded inquiry.
Having failed in a revolutionary attempt
to invade Guatemala from Mexican terriÂ­
tory, General _Barrandia took passage at
Acapulco for Panama. The consent of the
representatives of the United States was
sought to effect his seizure, first at-ChanÂ­
perlo where the steamer touched, and aftÂ­ I
erwards-at San Jose. The captain of the I
steamer refused to give up his passenger
without a written order from the United
States minister. The latter furnished the 1
desired letter stipulating the condition of
his action that Gen. Barrundla's life should
spared and that he should be tried only
for offences growing out of his insurrecÂ­
tionary movements. This letter was proÂ­
duced to the captain of the Acapulco by
the military commander at San Jose, as
his warrant to take the passenger from.
the steamer. General Barrundia resisteds
capture and was killed. It being evident
that the Minister, Mr. Mizeer, had ex-v
ceeded the bounds of his authority In interÂ­
vening in compliance with the demands of
the Guatemala authorities to authorize
and effect, in violation of precedent, the t
seizure on a vessel of the United States of
a passenger in transit charged with politiÂ­
cal offences in order that he might be tried
for such offences under what was describÂ­
.
ed as martial law, I was constrainedÂ­ to a
disavow Mr. Mizncr's act and recall him ii
from his post. e
THE NICARAGUA CANAL . -Â­
project, under the control of our citlzens, t
is making most encouraging progress, all
the preliminary conditions andÂ­ initial
1Â­
operations having been accomplished withÂ­ t
in the prescribed time.
CLAIMS AGAINST CHILL a
During the past year negotiations have e
been -renewed for the settlement of the b
claims of. American citizens against the if
government of Chili, principally growing P
out of the late war with Peru. The reÂ­ ri
ports from our Minister at Santiago warÂ­
rant the expectation of an early adjustÂ­
ment.
f OUR RELATIONS WITH CHINA, .
which have for ceveral years occupied so cI
Important a place in our deplomatil hisÂ­ g
tory, have called for careful consideration tl
and have been the subject of much correÂ­ q
spondence. The communications of the Â¶
Chinese minister have brought into view w
7
the whole subject of our conventional reÂ­ I
Ld lations with his country, and at the same S
time this government through its legation n
aÂ­ at Pekin has sought to arrange various rc
matters and complaints touching the inÂ­ P
terests and protection of our citizens in
s
nÂ­
China. In pursuance ofÂ­ the current resÂ­ gi
In olution of.. October 1, 1890. I have pro. Ct

The report of'the SecretarofAgrIouÂ­ odeal

irecÂ­ the fact that the year has been marked in
been a very unusual degree by agitation and orÂ­
y in ganization among the farmers lool~ng to
and an increase in the profits of their business.
have
It will be found that the efforts of the DeÂ­
ar is partment have been Intelligently and zealÂ­
ear, . Â©sly devoted to the promotion of the inÂ­
t of terests intrusted-to Its care. A-very subÂ­
exÂ­ stantial improvement in'the market prices
racy of the leading farm products during the
allyÂ­
Year isÂ­ noticed. The price of wheat adÂ­
vill vanced from 81 cents in October, 1889; to
sugÂ­ $1.00Y In October, 1890;Â­ corn from 31 r
hose
cents to 503 cents; oats from 199 cents i
sted
to 43 cents, and barley from 63 cents to 78 t
do cents. Meats showed a substantial butnot ii
insÂ­ so large an increase. The export trade in il
our live animals and fowli shows a very large s
increase. The total value of such exports
for theÂ­ year ending June 30, 1890, was I
tam $33,000,000 and the iincrease over the preÂ­ t
to ceding year wasp over $15,000,000. Nearly .h
890, 200,000 more cattle and over 45,000 more e:
'ved
hogs were exported thanin the preceding r
ent year. 'Thie export trade in beef and pork tl
enÂ­ products .and in dairy products was-very b
law largely increased, the-increase in the artl-p
-the cle of butter alone being from 15,504,978
rom
pounds to 29,748,042 pounds, and-the total
is increase in the value of meat and dairyÂ­
py products exported being $34,000,000. t
This trade so directly helpful to the
farmer it is believeved, will be yet further
and very largely increased when the sys w
the tem of inspection and sanitary supervision -
rey now provided by-law is brought fully into
e
1-4, operation. The efforts of the Secretary to
in -establish the healtbfulnesl of our meatsÂ­
our against the disparaging imputations that
ddÂ­ have been put upon them abroad have reÂ­
aels
suited in substantial progress. VeterinaÂ­ t
the ry surgeons sent out by the department w
ierÂ­
are now allowed to participate in the inÂ­ p'
onsÂ­ spection of the live cattle from this counÂ­
ing
try landed at the English docks, and durÂ­
ver
ing the several months they have been on
as duty no Case of contagious pleuro-pneuÂ­
[he
monia has been reported. This inspection

-abroad and the domestic Inspection of live
the
animals and pork products provided for
ing by the act-of August 30, 1890, will afford
It as perfect a guaranty for the wholesomeÂ­
nÂ­ ness of our meats offered for foreign conÂ­
els sumption as is anywhere given to any food
itd products, and its non-acceptance will quite
nilÂ­
clearly reveal the real motive of any conÂ­
the tinned restriction of their use, and that
atÂ­ having been made clear, the duty of the
InÂ­ Executive will be very plain.
reÂ­ The information given by the Secretary
of the progress and prospects of the beet
sugar industry is full of interest. It has
teÂ­ lready passed the experimental stage and
arÂ­
is a commercial success. The area over
itÂ­ which the sugar beet can be successfully
ed.
cultivated is very large and another field
etÂ­ crop of great value is offered to the choice
of the farmer. The Secretary of the

Treasury concurs in the recommendation

of -Â­ CIVIL SERVICE.
Ito
The law relating to the civil service,
to has, so far as I can learn, been executed
en by those having the power of appointment
ng
in the classified service with fidelity and
ut impartiality, and the service has been
ts incr-easiigly satisfactory. The report of
ad the commission shows a large amount of
roÂ­ good work done during the year with very
ft. limited apPropriations.
-n, THE W IORK OF THE LAST SESSION-WISE
_d .AND BENEFICIAL LEGISLATION.
on I congratulate the Congress and the
to country upon the passage-t the first sesÂ­
sion of the 51st Congress of an unusual
lt number of laws of very high importance. sot
his
That the results of this legislation will be em
a the quickening and enlargement -of our A.
s manufacturing industries, larger and betÂ­ tA.
ter markets for our bread stuffs and proÂ­ on
visions both at home and abroad, more re
constant employment and better wagesefor
d -our working people and an increased supÂ­
ply of a safe currency for the transaction
of of business, I do not doubt. Some of these
or measures were enacted at so late a period
that the beneficial effects upon commerce .:
11 which were in the contemplation of ConÂ­ frh
he gresahave as yedbut partially manifested
of themselves. The general trade and indusÂ­ t
at trial condltions throughout the country
hÂ­
during-the year have shown marked imÂ­
to provement.Â­ For many years prior to 1888
e the merchandise balances of foreign trade
al had been largely in our favor, but during
that year and the year following they
turned against us; It is very gratifying
to know that the last fiscal year again
ie
-
shows a balancein our favor of over $68,Â­
- 000,000. The bank clearingssÂ­ which furnÂ­
'rÂ­ Ish a good-test of the volume of business
aÂ­
transacted for the-first 10 months of the
f year 1890, show, as compared with the
ie
same month of 1889, an Increase for the
iÂ­ Whole country of about 8.4 per cent, while
n the increase outside of the city of New
n York was over 13 per cent. During the
Id month - of October the clearings or the
to
whole country showed an increase of 3.1
Is per cent over October 1889, while outside
. of New York the increase was 11l per
y cent.
GENERAL PROSPEBITY.
These figures show that the increase in
the volume of business was very general
l throughout the country. That this larger
I business was being conducted upon a safe
and profitable basis Is shown by the fact
that there W9ere 300 less failures reported
in October, 1890, than in the same month
e of the preceding year, with liabilities diÂ­
, minished by about $,5000,,000. The value
- of our exports of domesticÂ­ merchandise


2a during the last year was $115,000,000
1Â­ greater than the preceding year and was
tÂ­ only exceeded once in our history. About
)f
8100,O00000 or this excess was in agriculÂ­
n tural products. The production of pig
e iron, always a good gauge of general prosÂ­
is perity, is shown by rrecent census bulleÂ­
ie
tin to have--been 13 per cent; greater in
1890 than In 1880, and the production of
1Â­
steel 290 per cent. greater. Mining in coal
i bhas had no limitation except thatresulting
fÂ­ rom -deflcient transportation. The general
e testimony is that labor is everywhere
.tfully employed, and the'reports: for the
.last year show a smaller number of emÂ­
sÂ­ ployes affected by strikes -and lockouts
t than in any year since 1884. The depresÂ­
, sion in the price of agricultural products
r had been greatly relieved and a buoyant
f and hopeful tone was beginning to be felt
v
by all our people.
THESE PROMISING INFLUENCES
'have been in some-degree checked by the
suprising and very unfavorable monetary
events which have recently taken place-in
f| England."" It is gratifying to know that a
[these did not grow in any degree out of
r
the financial questions of London with our -
r
people, or out of any discredit attached to
;
1 our securlties held in that marke t. The e
return of our bonds and stocks wascaused feb
.by
-a money stringency in England, not by -
S-any
loss or credit in the securitiesÂ­ themÂ­
, '
selves. We could not, howeverrwholly
escape the ill effects of a foreign money
agitation accompanied by such extraordiÂ­
nary incidents as characterized this. It is in
'
-not believed, however, that these evil inciÂ­ grap
dents. which have for the time unfavorÂ­ it be:
ably affected -values in this country, can fairl
long withstand thie strong, safe and wholeÂ­
s6me Influences which are opera ting to
give to.oui people profitable returns in all
branches of legitimate trade and !industry.
THE TARIFF 4AW SHOUILD STAND.
_The. spprehension .that our tariff, may
again and at once be subjected to importÂ­
ant general changes would undoubtedly
add a depressing nfluence ofthie most serx.
onus character. The general tariff, act has (I
only., partially gone-into operationi, some
;of-its Important provisionsbeing limited to S
go into effect at dates yet Ifa thtÂ­ t future.
The general provisionsof the law have been Boon

act was-by :many hastiiy as ribed .to-that
act. -otice_ `.was not taken of the fact that
the general tendency of: he markets
as
uipward from influeeees wholI apartfroin
the recent tariff legislatlotn. The-enlarge-Â­
menittofaour e~rsncy by: the silver bill unÂ­
I
doubtedly gave an .-upward tendenoye to =




 trade and had a marked effect upon prices,
but this natural and desired effect of the
silver legislation was by many erroneously
attributed to the tariff act.
There is neither wisdom nor justice in
the suggestion that the subject of tariff
revision shall be again opened before this
law has had a fair trial. It is quite true
that every tariff schedule is subject to obÂ­
jections. No bill was ever framed, I supÂ­
pose, that in all of its rates and classificaÂ­
tions had the full approval even of a party
caucus. Such legislation is always and
necessrily the product of compromise as to
details and theJpresent law is no exception,
but in its general scope and effect I think
it. will justify the support of those who beÂ­
lieve that American legislation should conÂ­
serve and defend American trade and the
wages of American workmen. The. misÂ­
information as to the terms of the act,
which has been so widely disseminated nat
'home and abroad, will be corrected by
experience and the evil auguries as to its
results confounded by the market reports,
the savings banks, international trade
balances and the general prosperityof our
people.
Already we begin to hear from abroad
and from our custom houses that the proÂ­
ibitary effect upon importations imputed
to the act is not justified. The imports at
the port of New York for the first three
weeks of November were nearly eight per
cent. greater than for the same period In
1889 and 29 per cent. greater than-in the
same period of 1888; and so far from being
an act tq limit exports I confidently-belleve
that under it we shall secure a larger and
more profitable participation in foreign
trade than we have ever enjoy ed, and that
we shall recover a proportionate particiÂ­
pation-in the ocean carrying trade of the
world.

RESIDENT'S MESSAGE,.
[Continued from First Page. h
FOREIGN HYPOCRISY. ti
The criticisms of the bill thathave come r'
to us from foreign sources may well bereÂ­ b
jected for repugnancy. If these critics S
really believe that the adoption by. us of a a
free trade policy, or of tariff rates having si
reference solely to revenue, would dimiaÂ­ ei
ish the partlclpatlon:of their own countries. b
in the commerce of the world their advoÂ­ p
cacy.and promotion by speech and other a
forms of organized effort o this movement sa
among our people is a rare exhibition of -01
unselfishness in trade. And on the other A
hand if they sincerely believe .that the c
adoption of a protective tariff policy byÂ­ o
this country inures to their profit and our
n
hurt, it is noticeably strange that they ii
should lead the outcry against the authors o
of a policy so helpful to their countrymen, t:
and crown with their favor those who
|
would snatch from them a substantial a
share of a trade with other lands already $
inadequate to their necessities. There is t
no disposition among any of our people to c
promote prohibitory or retaliatory legislaÂ­
|
tion. Our policies are adopted .not.to the a
hurt of others but to secure for ourselves a
those advantages that fairly grow out of s
our favored position as a nation. Our t
form of government with its incident of 'I
universal suffrage-makes it imperative that a
we shall save our working people from the a
agitation and distresses which scant work
|
and wages that have no margin for comÂ­ e
fort always beget. But after all this is -
done it will be found that our markets are
open to friendly
COMMERCIAL EXCHANGES - r
of enormous value to the other great powÂ­ t
ers. From the time of my induction I
into office the duty of using every power i
and influence given by law'to the ExecuÂ­ i
tive department for the development of
3
larger markets for our products, especÂ­ t
lally our farm products, has been kept e
constantly in mind and no effort has been t
or will be spared to promote that end. We a
are under no disadvantage in any foreign t
market except that we pay our workmen i
t and workwomen better wages than are t
paid elsewhere; better kbstractly, better
relatively to the cost of the necessities of
life. I don't doubt that a very large t
ly increased foreign, trade is accessable
to us without bartering for it either our
own home market for such products of
the farm and-shop as our own people can -t
supply, or the wages of our-working peoÂ­
ple. In many of the products of wood
and iron, and in meats and breadstufis, we
have advantages that only need better
r
facilities of intercourse and transportation r
to secure for them large foreign markets. a
The reciprocity clause of the`tariff act
wise y and effectively opens the way to
t
secure a large reciprocal trade in exchange i
for the free admission to our ports of cerÂ­ 1
iain products. The right of Independent
nations to make special reciprocal trade
concessions is well established and does -
not impair-either the comity due to anothÂ­
er power or what is known as the
'AAAVORED NATION CLAUSE"" f
so generally found in commercial treaties. c
What is given toone tor an adequate n
agreed consideration cannot be claimdd d
by another freely. The state of the reveÂ­ g
nues was such that we could dispense with l
any import duties on coffee,. tea, hides, d
and the lower gradesÂ­ of sugar and moÂ­
lasses. That the larga advantage resultÂ­
tng to the countries producing and exportÂ­
log these articles by placing them on the a
free list entitled us to expect a fair return r
in the way of customs concessions upon e
articles exported by us to them was obviÂ­ d
ous; to gratuitously abandon this opporÂ­ i
tunity to enlarge our trade, would be an t
unpardonable error.
There were but two methods of mainÂ­ d
taining control of this question open to t
Congress. To place all of these articles $
up:n the dutiable list subject to such I
treaty agreements as could be secured, or s
to place them all presently upon the free
list, but subject to the re-Imposition of ,
specified duties if the countries from e
which we received them should refuseto o
give to us suitable reciprocal benefits. t
This latter method, I think, possesses t
great advantages. Itexpresses in advance g
the consent of Congress to reciprocity arÂ­ ,
rangements affecting these products which t
must otherwise have been delayed and unÂ­ e
ascertained until each treaty was ratified e
by the Senate and the necessary legislation t
enacted by Congress. Experience has
shown that some treaties looking to recipÂ­ c
rocal trade have failed to secure a twoÂ­ t
thirds vote in the Senate -for ratification,
and others having passed that stage have
1
for years awaited the concurrence of the
H
House and Senate in such modification of
3
cur revenue laws as were necessary to
give effect to their provisions. We now
have the concurrence of
BOTH HOUSES I
in advance in a distinct and definite offer
3
of free entry to our ports of specific artiÂ­
cles. The Executive is not required to I
deal in coniecture as to what Congress will
accept-indeed the reciprocity provision is
Smore
than an offers our part of the barÂ­ .
gain is complete. Delivery has been made
B
and when the countries from which we reÂ­
ceive sugar, coffee, tea and hides have
placed on their free lists such of our prodÂ­
ucts as shall be agreed upon as an equivaÂ­
lent for our concession, a proclamation of
Sthat fact completes the.transaction. In
the meantime our own people have free (
sugar, tea, coffee and hides. The IndicaÂ­
tions thnus far given are very hopeful of


early and favorable action by the counÂ­
tries from which we receive our large imÂ­
ports of coffee and sugar,.and it is confiÂ­
dently believed that It steam communica, r
tion with these countries can be promptly
improved and enlarged the next year will a
show a most gratifying increase in our exÂ­
ports of breadstuffs and provisions, as
well as ofÂ­ some Important lines of manuÂ­
factured goods,
AMERICAN STEAMSHIP LINES.
In addition to the important bills that t
became laws before the adjournment of 'I
the last session some other bills of the a
highest importancesiwere well advanced a
toward a final vote andÂ­ now stand upon c
the calendars of the two houses in favored t
positions. The present session has a fixed a
limit and if these measures are not now r
brought to a final vote all the work that t
has been done upon them by this Congress o
Is lost. I t,Â­ or. per onsideration or these, y
of en appor lonment bill and of the
annual appi.-prlat,.n bills will require not y
only thst no working day of the session g
shall be lost, but that measures of minor d
and l',cal interest shall not be allowed to
interrupt, or retard the progress of those
that are of universal Interest. In view of
these conditiona_I refrain-from bringing e
before y-u at this time some suggestions t
that would otherwise be made and most f
earnestly invoke your attention to the P
duty of perfecting the Important legislaÂ­
tlonnow well advanced. To some of these a
measures which seem to me most ImportÂ­ I
ant legislation is now well advanced. To b
some of these measures which seeds to me P
most Important I now briefly call your n
attention. I desire to repeat with added a
urgency the recommendations contained
in my last annual message In relation to a
the development of American steamship O
lines. The reciprocity clause of the tariff t
bill will be largely limited, and its benefits t
retarded and diminished If provision is not e
contemporaneously made to encourage
-the establishment of first-class steam comÂ­
munication between our ports and the t
PNRTS OF SUCH NATIONS
as may meet' our overtures for enlarged I
commercial exchanges. Steampships carÂ­ v
rying the malls statedly and frequently p
and offering to passengers a comforable, a
safe end speedy transit, Is the firstÂ­ condiÂ­ t
tion of foreign trade. It carries the order
or the buyer, but not all that Is ordered or r
bought. It gives to the sailing vessel such t
cargoes as are -not urgent or perishable,. c
and-indirectly at least promotes that imÂ­ t
portant adjunct of commerce: There is a
now both in this country and In the naÂ­ e
Lions of Central and-South Amerl a a state. e
of expectaitlon-.and confidence as to inÂ­ t
creased trade that will give a double value:
to your prompt abtion upon this question. c
The present situation of our mall comr -I
munication with Australia illustrates the a
importance of early action by Congress.
;
The Oceanic Steamship Company mainÂ­ t
tains a line of steamers between San FranÂ­ a
cisco, Sydney and Aukland consisting of c
three vessels, two of which are of United
States registery and one of forelenÂ­ regisÂ­
try. For the service doneoÂ­ by this line in
carrying the mails we pay annually. the
sum of 846,000 being ansestimated the full
sea and United States inland postage
whlcI~l the limit fixed bylaw. The colÂ­
onies of New South Wales and'New ZeaÂ­ a
land have been payinglannually to thesa
lines.
37,000 PoaNDs c
b or carrying the malls from Sydney andl i


Ausotland to San Franoleco. The contract
under which this payment has-been made I
is now about to expire andÂ­ those coloanle 1
have refused to renew thelrcontact unless -
the United States shall paysr more equitÂ­
able proportion. of the whole sum necessaÂ­
ry to maintain the service. I am advised.
by the Postmaster General that the United
Staten receives for carrying=the Australla -
imallo, brought to San FrsnciscoÂ­ In` these
steamers, by rall to Vanconuveran estimatÂ­
ed annual income of $75,000,"" while, as -I
have stated, we are paying ou3 for the-supÂ­
port of the steamship line that bringkithis
mail to us only 846,000, leaving an aisnual
surplus resulting from this service of $29,Â­
000. The trade of the Unlted States with
Australia, which is in a' considerable part
carried by these steamers, andÂ­ the whole
of which is practically dependent upon the
mail communication which they maintain,
Is'largely in our favor. Our total exports
of merchandise to Australian ports during
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1890. were
$11,266,484, while the total imports of
merchandise from these-ports wereÂ­ only
84,277,676. If we are not willing to see
this important steamship line -withdrawn
or continued with Vancouver substituted
for San Francisco as the AmericanÂ­ termlÂ­
nos, Congress should put it .ii -the power
of the Postmaster General to make a liberÂ­
al increase in the amount now paid for the
transportation of. this important mail.
The South Atlantic and Gulf ports occupy
-avery favored position towards the new.
and important commerce whichÂ­ the reclÂ­
proclty clause of the tariff act and the postal

.
and-steamer lines from these ports to some
northern port of South America'will alÂ­
most certainly effect a connection between
the railroad system of te -continents beÂ­
fore a continuous line of railwayascan be
put into operation. The very large approÂ­
priation made at the last session of ConÂ­
areas for the harbor of Galvestornwas-jusÂ­
tifled, as it seemed-to me, by these considÂ­
erations. The great Northwest will feel
the advantage of trunk lines to the South
as well-as to the East, and of the new
markets opened for their surplus food
products, and for many of their manufacÂ­
tured goods.
INTERNATIONAL AMERICAN BANK. -
I had occasion in May last to transmit
to Congress a report adopted by the InÂ­
ternational American Conference upon the
subject of the incorporation' of an InternaÂ­
-tional American Bank with a view to faÂ­
cilitating money exchange between the
States represented in that conference.
Sueh-an institution would greatly promote
the trade we are seeking to develop. I
renew the recommendation.that a careful
and well-guarded charter be granted. I
do not think the powers granted should
include those ordinarily exercised by
trust, guaranty, and safe deposit companÂ­
ies, or that more branches in the United
States should be authorized than are
strictly necessary to accomplish the obÂ­
ject primarily in view, namely, convenient
foreign exchanges. It is quite important
that prompt action should be taken in this
matter in order that any appropriations
for better communication with these
countries and any agreements that may be
made for reciprocil trade may not be hinÂ­
dered by inconvenience of making exchanÂ­
ges through European money centres, or
burdened by the tribute which is-an inciÂ­
dent of that method of business.
THE BILL FOR THE RELIEF OF THE SUÂ­
PREME COURT,
after many years of -discussion, has
reached a position where final-action is
easily attainable and it is hoped that any
differences of opinion may be so harmonÂ­
ized as to saveÂ­ the essential features of
this very Important measure. In this conÂ­
nection I earnestly renew my recommenÂ­
dation that the salaries of the Judges of
the United States District Courts be so reÂ­
adjusted that none of them shall receive
less than $5,000 per annum.
SPANISH AND MEXICAN LAND GRANTS.
The subject of the unadjusted Spanish.
and Mexican land grants and the urgent
necessity for providing some commission
or tribunal for the trial of questions of
title growing out of them were twice
brought by me to the attention of ConÂ­
gress at the last session. Bills have been
reported from the proper committees in
both houses upon the subject and I very
earnestly hope that this congress will put
an end to the delay which has attended
the settlement of the disputes as to. titles
between the settlers and the claimants unÂ­
der these grants. These disputes retard
the prosperity and disturb the peace -of
large and important communities. The
governor of New Mexico in his last reÂ­
port to the Secretary of the Interior sugÂ­
gested some modifications of the provisÂ­
ions of the pending bills relating to/the
small holdings of farm lands. I commend
to your attention the suggestions of the
Secretary of the Interior on this subject.
BANKRUPT LAW.
The enactment of a National Bankrupt
law, I still regard as very:desirable. T'he
constitution having given to Congress
jurisdlction of this subject, it should be
exercised and uniform rules provided for
the administration of the aflairs of insolÂ­
vent debtors. - The inconveniences resultÂ­
Sing from the occasional and temporary
exercise of this power by Congress and
from the conflicting State codes of insolÂ­
vency which come into force itermediateÂ­
ly, should be removed by the enactment
of a simple, inexpensive and permanent
National Bankrupt law.


A JUOa2' UUÂ±SLJItu ' LAW.
I also renew my recommendation in
favor of legislation affording lust copyÂ­
right protection to foreign authors on a
footing of reciprocal advantage for our
authors abroad.
CAR COUPLERS.
It may still be possible for this Congress
to inaugurate suitable legislation looking
to uniformity and increased safety in the
use of couplers and brakes upon freight
trains engaged in inter-State commerce.
The chief difficulty in the way is to secure
an agreement as to the best appliances,
simplicity, effectiveness and cost being
considered. This dflficulty will only yield
to legislation which should be based upon
a full. inquiry and impartial tests. The
purpose shouid be to-secure the co-operaÂ­
tion of all well disposed managers and
owners, but the fearful fact that every
year's delay involves the sacrifice of two
thousand lives and the maiming of 20,000
young men should plead both with Con.
gress and the managers against needless
delays. -
TWATER SUPPLY FOR ARID LANDS.
The subject of the. conservation and
equal distribution of -the water. supply of
the arid regions has had much attention
from Congress, but has not as yet been
put upon a permanent and satisfactory
bass.Â­ The urgency of the subject does
not grow out of any large present demand.
for the use of these lands for agriculture,
but out of the danger that' the water supÂ­
ply and slt( s for thernecessary catch-basins
may fall into the hands of Individuals, or
private corporations, and -be used to-renÂ­
der subservient the large areas dependent
upon such supply. The owner of the 'vaÂ­
ter is tlhi owner of the ladds, however theÂ­
titles may run, All unappropriated naÂ­
tional water sources and all necessary resÂ­
ervoir.sites should be held by the GovernÂ­
ment-for the equal use at fair rates by the
homestead settlers who will eventually
take up these Jands.. The United 'States
should not; in my opinion, undertake the
construction of dams-or canals, but should
limit its work.: toÂ­ such surveys and obserÂ­
vations as-will determine the water sup.
ply, both - surface - and subterraneau, the
areas capable of irrigation and the -locaÂ­
tion and storage capacity of reservoirs.
This done, the use-of water and of the
reservoirsemight be-granted .to the respecÂ­
tive States, or Territories, or individuals,-Â­
or associations, upon the conditiod that
the necessary works should be constrioted
and the water furnished at a fair rate withÂ­
out discrimination, the rates to be subject.
ed to supervision -by the legislature or by
boards of water commissioners duly conÂ­
stitutid. The essential thinng to b~ so.
'Cured -is the common. and equal-supply.
-It were almost.-better, that these -,lands
should remain-Â­ arid than .that those who
occupythem' should become the slaves of
unrestrained: monopolies controlling -the
one essential element of land values and""
crop results.
POSTAL TELEGRAPH.
-. The use of the telegraph by-theÂ­ PostE
office Department as a means for the rapild
transmissionf of written communications
is, I believe, upon; proper terms, quite
deslrable, The govetnment does. nt own

THE NECESSITY OF Al EFFECTIVE FEDEÂ­
SRAL ELECTION LAW.
If anyÂ­ intelligent and :loyal company of:
American -citizens were required to cataÂ­
logue the essential human conditions of
nationalÂ­ life,-doÂ­ not doubt that. with
absolute unininity they' would begin.lwith
.""free and honest electionse, and ItaisgratÂ­
ifying to 'know that generally-there is.a
growing demand: for better election laws.
But against-this sign-of hope and progress
must be set the-depressing and undeniable
fact, that. election -laws -and methods are
sometimes cunningly contrived to* secure
minority control, while violence coipletesÂ­
the shortcoming bftfraud.. In my last anÂ­
-nual messageI suggestedl that the develop-.
ment of the existing law providing afeder-l
al ,superyision-ofa ongresslonal-elections
offered an i flective method of reforming
these abuses. The need of such a law has
manifested itself in many parts 'of the1.
country and its wholesome restraints and
penalties will. be useful .in alo . The. conÂ­
stitutionality of such legislation bas been
affirmed by the Supreme Court. Its probÂ­
able effectiveness is evidenced by the :
CHARACTER OF THE. OPPOSIBION THAT'IS
MADE TO IT.Â­
It bas-been .denounced:as if it were an
new exercise of Federal =power and an in.
vasion of the rights of-the states.Â­ Nothing
could be further from the truth. Congress
has fixed the time for the election of memÂ­
bers of Congress. -Â­ It has been declared
that votes for members of Congress-must
be by written or-printed ballot. It has
provided for the appointment by the cirÂ­
cult courts in certain cases and upon the
petition of a certain number of citizens, of
election supervisors, -and made it. their
duty to supervise the-registration of voters
conducted -by the state officers; to chelÂ­
Slenge
persons offering toÂ­ register; to-perÂ­
Ssonally inspect and scrutinize the registry
lists, and to affix their names - to the-lists,
for the purpose of identification and the
prevention of frauds; to-attend at elections
and remain with the boxes till the votes
are all cast and counted; to attacti'to the
registry lists and election returns any
statement touching-the accuracyÂ­ andfair.
ness of the registry and election, and to
take and transmit to the clerk of. the
House of Representatives-any evidence of
-fraudulent practices which may be preÂ­
sented to them. The same law provides.
for the appointment of -deputy United
I tates marshals to attend at the polls, supÂ­
port the supervisors in the discharge of
their duties, aid to arrest persons violatÂ­
nlog the election laws. The provisions
- OF THIS FAMILIAR.8TATUTE -
have been puthfto exercise by both the
great political parties; and in the North as
well as well as in the South, by the filing
with the court of-the petitions required by
law. It is not therefore a question' whether
we shall have a Federal election.law forjwe
now have one and have had: for nearly
twenty years, but whether we shall have
an effective law. The present law stops
just short of effectiveness, for it surrenders
to the local authorities all control over the
certification which establishes the prima
facie right to a seat in the House of Rep-Â­
resentatives. This defect should be cured.
Equality of representation and the purity
of the electionsÂ­ must be maintained or
everything that is valuable in our system
oftgovernment is lost. The qualifications
of an election must be sought in the -law,
not in the opinions, prejudices or fears of
any class, however powerful. ThepathÂ­
of the elector to the ballot box must be
free from the ambush of fear and the enÂ­
I
ticements of fraud, the count so true and
open that none shall gainsay it. Such a
law should be absolutely -non-partisan and
impartial. Itshould give the advantage
to honesty and the control to majorities.
Surely there is nothing
.
SECTIONAL ABOUT THIS CRlED
i
and if it shall happen ihat the.penalties of
laws intended to enforce these rights fall
3
hereÂ­ and-not there, it' is3 not because Ithe
law is sectional but because, happily,
crime is local and not universal. Nor
should it be forgotten that every law,
Âºwhether
relating to elections or to any
other subject, whether enacted by the State
or by the Nation, 'has. force tehind it.
Thecourts, the marshal or constable and
the prison are alt and always behind the

f
unfriendliness to any section or class who
3
seeks only tg restrain yrolations-of laWand

can afford to have it known that officers
3
ho are charged with the .preservation of
i
the public peace and the restraint or the
criminal classes are themselves the product
of fraud or violence. The magistrate is
then without respect and the law without
sanction. The flood of lawlessness cannot
be levelled adndmade to run lrone chapiiel.
The lilling of an United States Marshal
carrying a writ of arrest for an-election
offense is
.
FULL OF PROMPTING AND [SUGGESTION
to men who are pursued by a city marshal
for a crime against life or property. -But
Sit is said that this legislation will revive
race-animosities and some bave even sugÂ­
gested that when the peaceful methods of
fraud are made Impossible they may be
t
supplemented by intimidation and violence.
If the proposed law-gives to any qualified
elector, by a hair's weight, more than his


equal Influence, or, detracts by so trneb
from any other qualified elector, it is iully
impeached. But if the law is equal and
the anirnositiqs-it is to evoke-grow out of
the fact that some electors have been

without shame, and cannot be given any

No cholceis left to me but to enforce with

of such laws be promptly remedied. If to

                 WHITE WASH.-AS the citizens of our village I have, much to their credit, turned their attention to painting and white washing the out side of their buildings, we insert the following in hopes something may be drawn from it to their advantage on the score of utility and economy.
                 WASH AND STUCCo  WAsH.-The basis for both is lime, Which must be first slacked with hot water in a Smuall tub or piggin, and covered, to keep in the steam; it then should be passed in a fluid form, through a fine sieve, to obtain the flour of the lime. It must be put on with a painter s brush-two coats are best for outside work.
                 First. To make a fluid for the roof, and other parts of wooden houses to render them , and coating for brick, tile, stone work and rough cast, to render them  to the water, and give them a durable and handsome appearance. The proportions in each recipe are five gallons. Slack your lime as before directed,, say six quarts, into which put one quart of clean rock salt for each gallon of water, to be entirely dissolved by boiling, and  clean; then add to the five gallons one pound of alum, half apound of copperas, three fourths of a pound of potash-the last to be gradually added; four quarts of fine sand or hard wood ashes must also be added; any coloring matter may be mixed in such quantity as to give it the requisite shade. It will look better than paint, and be as lasting as slate. It must be put on hot. Old shingles must be first cleaned with a stiff broom, when this may be applied. It will stop the small leaks, prevent moss from growing render them incombustible, and last many years.
                 Second. To make a brilliant Stucco White Wash for buildings, inside and out. Cake clean lumps of well burnt stone lime; slack the same as before; add onefourth of a pound of whiting or burnt alum pulverized, one pound of loaf or other sugar, three pints of rice flour inade into a very thin and well boiled paste, starch, or  and one pound of clean glue, dissolved in the same manner as cabinet-makers do. This may be applied cold within doors, but warm outside. It will be more brilliant than plaster of paris, and
                 retain its brilliancy for many years, say from fifty to one hundred. It is Superior, nothing equal The east end of the President's house in Washington is washed with it.

""Exceptlng its handful of magnificent
statesmen and. 'its . military heroes,""
says the most recent writer upon AmeÂ­
rica, ""the people owe more to DartÂ­
mouth's physician-teacher than to any
one man.

highest office-holders at Washington, in

'The story of the life-work of this
giant among men hos been often 'told
and Is familiar' to most readers. The
likeness above is probably thehbest porÂ­
trait of him yet printed.
It.was' the world-famed discovery of
Pmrossor Phelps of an infallible cure
for ihose fearful ills that result'from an
impalred nervous system and impure
blood, which has endeared the great
'doctor to the world, and made his life
an era. In the practice of medicine.
Professor Phelps was born In ConnecÂ­
ticut, anid graduated from the military
school at Norwich. Vt. He studied
medicidne' wlth Professor Nathan Smith.
of New Naven, Conn., and graduated
In medicine at Yale.
His unusual 'talent soon brought him




 reputatopn and prominence among his
professional brethren. First he was
elected to the professorslhp' of anatomy
and surgery in the Vermont University.
Next he was appointed lecturer on
materia medico and medical botany in
Dartmouth College. The next year he
was chosen professor of the chair then
vacated by PiofessorhRobby, and occuÂ­
pied the' chair, the most important one
n the country. at the time when he
first formulated his most remarkable
prescriptlon: . .. -

mony to the ,value of Paine's, celery

And then also from ""the plain peoÂ­
ple"" there come thousands of honest,.
straightforward, heartfelt letters, tellÂ­
ing how Paine's celery compound has
made them well.
Their testimony simply goes'to show
what New England's vigorous essayist
has so aptly said, that Paine's celery
compouhnd is not a patent medicine; It
is not a saroapailla; it. is not a mere
tonic; It Is, not an ordinary. nervlne-lt is
far beyond them'all as the diamond is
superior to cheap glass:
'It makes people well, It is the one
true spelflc recognized and prescribed

prolfession a positive cure for sleeplessÂ­

rheumatism, alil nervous 1iseases and
kidney troubles. For all such comÂ­

succeeded again and again where everyÂ­

It is as harmless as it Is good, and
It was the universal advice of the mediÂ­

300 brakemen wero killed and 7,841 maimed

L'2,300. This Is a cruel and largely a needless

The method ot appointment by the States

has lecenlly attracted renewed Interest by
reason of n departure by the State of MichiÂ­

101m in all the slates. Prior to 183'.' various
methods had been used by the different States
and even b) tho same Slate. In some tho
cholco was undo by lhe Legislature;
lu o hers electors were chosen by districts,
but moro generally by tho vofrs of the
wliclu state upon a general ticket. Tho
mot ement towards tho adoption of iho lastÂ­

went steadily forward among the States, unÂ­

Is, I think, an unfortunate and even
a threatening episode, and one that may
well suggest whether the States that still
give their approval to the old and prevailing
method ought not to secure.by a cnnstl tutloual
amendment, a practice which has had the
upproval of all. The recent Michigan legislaÂ­

I should say, without hesitation, in tho overÂ­

terminable nnd Inconclusive debate while we
take, by consent, one step In tho direction
of reiorm by eliminating the gerrvmander,
which has been denounced by all parties, as
an Influenco in the selection of electors ot
President and members ot Congress ? All the
States have, acting freely and separately, deÂ­
termined that the choice of electors by a genÂ­
eral ticket Is the wisest and safest method,
and tt would seem there could be no objecÂ­
tion to a constitutional amendment making
that method permanent. It a legislature
chosen In one year upon purely local quesÂ­
tions Bhould, pending a Presidential contest,
1 meet, rescind the lnw for a choice upon a
general ticket, and provide for the choice of
electors by the Legislature, and this trick
should determldo tho result. It Is not too
much to say that tho public peace might bo
seriously and widely endangered.
I have alluded to the"" gerrymander"" as af.
icctlng the method of selecting electors of
I President by congressional districts, but the
primary Intent and effect of this form of politiÂ­
cal robbery have relation to the selection of
members of the Housed liopresontatlvcs. The
power ot congress is ample to deal with this
threatening aud Intolerable abuse. The unÂ­
failing test ot sincerity In eloctlon reform will
bo louud In a willingness to confer as to remÂ­
edles and tn put tutu force such measures as
will most effectually preserve the right of the
people to free and equal representation.

to bring to bear the constitutional powers of

GIANTS.
Sonic of Them, Ancient aud Jlodcrn.
The Bible mentions several cases of
giants, as the Rephaims the Anakims,
the Emiins, the Zonzonims.and others.
Profane historians also mention giants;
theygac seven feet of height to HerÂ­
cules, their first hero, and in onr days
ive have seen men eight feet high. The
giant vrho was shown in Kouen in 1835
measured eight feet some inches. The
Emperor Jlaxiinin was of that size;
Skeakins and Platcras, physicians of
the lest century, saw several of that
stature, and Gorpsns sawagirlwhowas
10;fecthigh.
The body of Orestes, according to the
Greeks, was 11 feet; the giant Galbara,
brought from Arabia to Rome under
Claudius Ca-sar, was near 10 feet; and
the bones of Secondilla and Pufio, keepÂ­
ers of the gardens of Sallust, were but
six inches shorter.
Funnam, a Scotchman, who lived at
the time of Eugene the Second, king
of Scotland, measured Hi feet: and
Jacob le Maire, in his voyage to the
Straits of Magellan, reports that on the
17th day of December, 1615, they found
at Port Desire several graves covered
with stones; and having the curiosity
to remove the stones, they discovered
human skeletons of 10 and 11 feet long.
The Chevalier Scory, in his voyage to
the Peak of Tencriffe, says that they
fonnd in one of the sephulchral caverns
of that mountain theheadof a Gauuche,
which had SO teeth, and the body was
not less than 15 feet long.
The giant Ferragus, slain by Orlando,
nephew of Charlemagne, was 18 feet

Roland, a celebrated anatomist, who
wrote in 1611, says that, some years
before, there was to be seen in the suÂ­
burbs of St, Germain the tomb of the
giant Isoret, who was 20 feet high,
In Rouen, in 1509, in digging in the
ditches near theDominicans, they found
a stone tomb containing a skeleton,
whose skull held a bushel of corn, and
whose shin-bone reached up tothegirdle
of the tallest man there, being about
four feet long, and consequently the
body must have been 17 or lb feet high.
Upon the tomb was a plate of copper,
whereon was engraved, ""In this tomb
lies the noble and puissant lord, the
Chevalier Ricon de Vallemont, and his
bones."" Platerus, a famous physician,
declares that he saw at Lucerne t he true
human bones of a subject which must
have been atleast 19 feet high.
Valence, in Dauphine, boasts ot posÂ­
sessing the bones of the giarA Bucart,
tyrant of the Yivarais, who was slam
by an arrowby thcCountdeCabdlon, his
vassal. The Dominicans had a par,t of
of the shin-bone, with the articulation
of the knee, and his figure painted in
fresco, with an inscription showing that
this giant was 22i feet high, and that
his bones were found in 1705 nearitue
banks of the ilorderi, a little river-at
the foot of the mountain of Crussol.
upon which, traditionays, the giant
dwelt. ,. .
Jan. 11, 1613, sonw masons digging
near the ruins of a castle in Dauphine,
in a field which by tradition had long
been called the Giant's field, at the depth
of 18 feet discovered a brick tombuO
feet long, 12 feet wide, and eight feet
high, on which waK a gray stone, with
the words Theutobochus Rex cut thereÂ­

the celebrated family medicine, known.as
bone to the back. His teeth were about
the size each of an ox's foot, and his
shin-bone measured four feet.
Near Mezarino, in Sicily, 1516, was
found a giant 30 feet high; his head was
the size of a hogshead, and each of his
teeth weighed five ounces.
Near Palermo, in the valley of MaÂ­
zara, in Sicily, a skeleton of a giant 30
feet long was found in the year 1518.
and another of 33 feet high in 1550; and
many curious persons have preserved
several of these gigantic bones.
The Athenians found near their city
two famous skeletons, one of 3t and the
other of 36 feet high.
At Totu. in Bohemia, in 753, was
found a skeleton, the head of which
could scarce be. encompassed by the
arms of two men together, and whose
legs, which they still keep in the castle
of that city, were 26 feet long.
The skull of the giant found in MaÂ­
cedonia, September, 1691, held 210
pounds of corn.
The celebrated Sir HanB Sloane, who
treated this matter very learnedly, docs
not doubt these facts, but thinks the
bones were those of elephants, whales,
or other enormous animals.
Elephants' bones may be shown for
those of giants, but they can never.imÂ­
pose on connoisseurs.
Whales which by their immense bulk
are more proper to be substituted for
the largest giants, have neither arms
nor legs; and the head of that nnimal
has not the least resembhigce to that of
a man. If it be true, therefore, that a
great number of the gigantic bones
which we have mentioned have been
seen by anatomists, and have by them
been reputed real human bones, the exÂ­
istence of giants is proved.

Following is the full text of President
2Â­
Cleveland's message as read in congress
today: 1
The assemblage within the nation's legÂ­
islative halls of those charged with the
d duty of making laws for the benefit of
a generous and free people impressively
suggests the exacting obligation and InÂ­
exorable responsibility involved in their
e task. At the threshold of such labor, now
'e
to be undertaken by the congress of the
1Â­
United States, and in the discharge of an
g executive duty enjoined by the constituÂ­
tion, I submit this communication, conÂ­
* taining a brief statement of the condiÂ­
Stion of our national affairs and recomÂ­
mending such legislation as seems to me
Is necessary and expedient.
THE STATE DEPART[IEENT.
d LI
Our Relations With All Foreign NaÂ­
tionn Peaceful and Friendly.
The history of our recent dealings with
other nations and our peaceful relations
e with them at this time additionally demÂ­
onstrate the advantage of consistently
adhering to a firm but just foreign polÂ­
Icy, free from envious or ambitious naÂ­
tional schemes, and characterized by enÂ­
r tire honesty and sincerity.
h During the past year, pursuant to a
s law of congress, commissioners were apÂ­
t, pointed to the Antv.erp industrial expoÂ­
t' sition. Though the participation of AmerÂ­
s ican exhibitors fell far shortof completely
iÂ­ llustrating our national ingenuity and
e industrial achievements, yet it was still
f creditable, in view of the' brief time ilÂ­
e lowed for preparatic n. I have endeavÂ­
f ored to impress upon the Belgian governÂ­
i1 ment the needlessness and positive harmÂ­
fulness of its restrictions upon the imÂ­
portation of certain of our food products
and have strongly urged that the rigid
t
supervision and inspection under our laws
are amply sufficient to prevent the exporÂ­
tation from this country of diseased cattle
s
and unwholesome meat.
e
THE BRAZILIAN REVOLUTION.
B
The termination of the civil war in BraÂ­
zil has been followed by the general prevÂ­
alence of peace and order. It appearing
at an early.stage of the insurrection that
its course would call for unusual watchÂ­
fulness on the part of this government,
our 'naval force in the harbor of Rio de
s
Janeiro was strengthened. This precauÂ­
-
tion, I am satisfied, tended to restrict the
I
issue to a simple trial of strength between
-
the Brazilian government and the inÂ­
i
surgents, and to avert complications
1.
which, at times, seemed imminent. Our
r
firm attitude of neutrality wasÂ­ maintained
9
tothe end. The insurgents received en.
B. ourieginent of-Â­ eventual asylum from t
our commaniders,. and such oppoSition-as,
a
they encountered was for the protection
of our commerce and was clearly justiÂ­
fled by public law.
A serious tension of relations having
arisen at the close of the war between
Brazil and Portugal, by reason of the
escape of the insurgent Admiral da Gama I
and his followers, the friendly offices of
our representatives to those countries
were exercised for the protection of the
subjects of either within the territory
of the-other.
Although the government of Brazil was
duly notified that the commercial arÂ­
rangement existing between the United
States and that country, based on the
third section of the tariff act of 1890, was
abrogated August 26, 1894, by the taking
effect of the tariff. law now in force, that
government subsequently notified us of
its intention to terminate such arrangeÂ­
ment January 1, 1895, in the exercise of
the right reserved in the agreement beÂ­
tween the two countries. I invite attenÂ­
tion to the correspondence between the,
secretary of state and the Brazilian minÂ­
ister on this subect.
THE CHILIAN CLAtMS.
The commission organized under the if
convention which we had entered into t
with Chili for..the settlement of the outÂ­ s
standing claims of each government a
against the other, adjourned at the end of f
the period stipulated for its continuance, c
leaving undetermined a number of AmerÂ­ f
ican cases which had been duly presented. n
These claims are not barred, and negoÂ­ is
tiations are in progress for their submisÂ­ o
sion to a tribunal. ti
THE NEW CHINESE TREATY. ti
The 17th of March, last, the new treaty -P
with China in further regulation of ChiÂ­
nese immigration, was signed at WashÂ­
ington, and August 13 it received the it
sanction of the senate. Ratification ona o
the part of China and the formal exÂ­ b
change are awaited to give final effect to tl
this mutually beneficial convention. tl
A gratifying recognition of the uniform T
impartiality of this country towards all n
foreign states was manifested by the coÂ­ to
incident request of the Chinese and JapÂ­ n
anese governments that the agents of the tt
United States should, within proper limit, tr
afford protection to the subjects of the ti
two countries during the suspension of h
dlplomatic relations because of the war. ss
This delicate office was accepted, and a u
misapprehension which gave rise to the r.
belief that in affording this kindly unoffiÂ­ ts
cial protection our agents would exercise
the same authority which the withdrawn
agents of the belligerents had exercised, o
was promptly corrected. Although the
war between China and Japan endangers ba
no policy of the United States, it deserves
our gravest consideration by reason of its
disturbance of our growing commercial
Interests in the two countries, and the
increased dangers which may result to
our citizens domiciled or sojourning in the cu
interior of China. Acting under a stlpulaÂ­ tr
tion in our treaty with Cores (the first st
concluded with a Western power), I felt tl<
constrained at the beginning of the conÂ­ in
troversy to tender our good offices to al
induce an amicable arrangement of Se
the initial difficulty growing out of er
the Japanese demands for adminisÂ­ th
trative reforms in Corea, but the unÂ­ ra
happy precipitation of actual hostillÂ­ ju
ties defeated this kindly purpose. DeÂ­
ploring the destructive war between the
two most powerful of the Eastern nations
and anxious that our commercial lnterÂ­ Y
ests in those countries may be preserved, b
and that the safety of our citizens there
shall not be jeopardized, I would not hesÂ­ Wt
itate to heed any intimation that our
friendly aid for the honorable terminaÂ­ an
tion of hostilities would be acceptable to e
both belligerents. th
A convention has been finally concluded foi
for the settlement by arbitration of the to
prolonged dispute with Ecuador growing ac
out of the proceedings against Emnillo an
Santos, a naturalized citizen of the United s'
States. to
THE ASSASSINATION OF CARNOT. ye
Our relations with the republic of
France continue, to be such as should exÂ­
Ist between nations so long bound toÂ­




 g
tether by friendly sympathy and similarÂ­
ity in their form of government. The reÂ­
cent cruel assassination of the president
of this sister republic called forth such
universal expressions of sorrow and conÂ­
dolence from our people and government
)X1Â­
as to leave no doubt of the depth and sinÂ­
cerity of our attachment. The resoluÂ­
tions passed by the senate and house of

ED GERMANY'S CATTLE EMBARGO.
Action upon the reported discovery of
Texas fever in cargoes of American imÂ­
portations of livestock and fresh meats
from this country has been revived. It is
n. hoped that Germany will soon become
convinced that the inhibition is as needÂ­
less as it is harmful to mutual interests.
The German government has excepted
to that provision of the customs of the
ent tariff act which imposes a discriminating
ess duty of 1-10 of a cent a pound on sugars
coming from countries paying an exÂ­
egÂ­ port bounty thereon, claiming that the
the
enacting of such duty is in contravention
of of articles 5 and 9 of the treaty of 1826,
ely with Prussia. In the interests of the comÂ­
InÂ­ merce of both countries, and to avoid even
ieir
the accusation of treaty violation, I recÂ­
ow ommend the repeal of so much of the
the
statute as imposes that duty, and I inÂ­
an vite attention to the accompanying report
tuÂ­ of the secretary of state, containing a disÂ­
anÂ­
cussion of the questions raised by the
diÂ­ German protests.
mÂ­ THE SEAL FISHERIES.
me
Early in the present year an agreement
was reached with Great Britain concernÂ­
ing Instructions to be given to the naval
commanders of the two governments in
iaÂ­ Behring sea and the contiguous North PaÂ­
cific ocean, for their guidance in the exÂ­
ith
ecution of the award of the Paris tribuÂ­
nal of arbitration and the enforcement
mÂ­ of the regulations therein prescribed for
tl the protection of seal life in the water
olÂ­ mentioned. An understanding has also
saÂ­ been reached for the payment by the
InÂ­ United States of $425,000. in full satisfacÂ­
tion of all claims which may be made by
a Great Britain for damages growing out
LpÂ­ of the controversy as to fur seals in BehrÂ­
toÂ­
ing sea, or the seizure of British vessels
erÂ­
engaged in taking seals in these waters.
sly
The award and -findings-of-the-Parls-triÂ­
nd bunal, to a great' extent, determined the
Aill facts and principles upon which these
ilÂ­ claims should be adjusted, and they have
YvÂ­ been subjected by the governments to
nÂ­ thorough examination upon the principles
as well as the facts which they involve. 1
s I am convinced that settlements upon the
id terms mentioned would be an equitable
ws
and advantageous one, and I recommend E
- that provision be made for the prompt
tie
payment of the stated sum. Thus far
only France and Portugal have signified
their willingness to adhere to the regulaÂ­ I
tions established under the award of the
Paris tribunal of arbitration.

The recognition usual in such cases has
been accorded the new government.
eÂ­
Under the present treaties of extradition
with Italy miscarriages of justice have
'Â­ occurred, owing to the refusal of that

Thus far our efforts to negotiate an

THE BLUEFIELDS AFFAIR. fo
Prominent among the questions of the r
year was the Blueflelds incident, ill which
is known as the Mosquito Indian strip,
bordering on the Atlantic ocean and
within the jurisdiction of Nicaragua. By
the treaty of 1860, between Great Britain
and Nicaragua, ,he former government Ch
expressly recognized the sovereignty of S
the latter over the strip, and a limited'
form of self-government was guaranteedi B
to the Mosquito Indians, to be exercised
according to their custom 'for themselves uri
and other dwellers within its limits. The st
so-called native government, which grew tol
to be largely made up of aliens, for many i
years disputed the sovereignty of NicarÂ­ Is

to maintain therein practically indepenÂ­ cal

dent munieipal government. Early in the
past year the efforts of Nicaragua to
inaintain sovereignty over the Mosquito
territory led to serious disturt,ances, culÂ­
rannating in the supprestsion of the nr1Â­
live government, and the attempted subÂ­
stitution of an impracticable composite
administratlon, in which Nicaragua and
alien residents were to participate. a;ilÂ­
ture was followed by an insturrection,
which for a time, subverted Nicaragua
rule, expelling her oilicers, and restoring
the old organization. 'tllis, in turn, gave
place to the existing local government,
established and upheld by Nicaragua. AlÂ­
though the alien interests, arraigned
against Nicaragua in these transactions.
have been largely Americanl t
and the comÂ­
noerce of that region for some time has
been, and still is, chiefly controlled by
ozur citizens, we cannot for that reason
challenge the rightful sovereingty of NicÂ­
aragua over this important part of her
domain. IFor some months one, and durÂ­
ing part of the time, two of our naval
ships, have been stationed at Bluefleldls
for the protection of all legitimate interÂ­
ests of our citizens. In September last
the government of Managua expelled
from Its territory 12 or more foreigners.
including two Americans for alleged DarÂ­
ticitation in the seditious or revolutionÂ­
ary movements against the republic at
Eluefields already mentioned, but through
the earnest remonstrance of this governÂ­
Ient the Americans have been permitted
to return to the peaceful management of
their business. Our naval commanders
at the scene cf these disturbances, by
thelr constant exhibition of firmness and
good ijudgment, contributed largely to the
prevention of more serious consequences,
and to the restoration of quiet and order.
I regret that in the midst of these ocÂ­
currences there happened a most grave
and irritating failure of Nicaraguan jusÂ­
tice. An American citizen named TWilson,
residing at Tlalna, in the Mosquito terÂ­
ritory, was murdered by one Arguello,
the acting governor of the town. After
some delay the murderer was arrested,
but so insecurely confined or guarded, that
he escapled, and, notwithstanding our reÂ­
peated demands, it is claimed that his
recapture has been impassible by reason
of his flight beyond Nicaraguan jurisdlicÂ­
tion.
The Nicaraguan authorities, having
given notice of forfeiture of the concesÂ­
sion to the canal company on grounds
purely technical, and not embraced in the
contract, have receded from that position.
Peru, J regret to say, shows symptoms
of domestic disturbance, due probably to
the slowness of her recuperation from the
distresses of the war of 1i5. Weakened
in resources, her difficulties in facing inÂ­
ternational obligations invite our kindly
sympathy and justly our forbearance In
pressing long Dending claims. I have
felt constrained to testify this sympathy
in connection with certain demands urÂ­
gently preferred by other powers.
THE DEATH OF THE CZAR.
The recent death of the czar of Russia
called forth appropriate expressions of
sorrow and sympathy on the part of our
government with his bereaved family and
the Russian people. As a further demonÂ­
stration of reciprocal friendship oure minÂ­
ister at St. Petersburg was directed to
represent our government at the funeral

- THE SALVADORIAN REFUGEES.
The government of Salvador, having
been overthrown by an abrupt popular
outbreak, certain of its oIlitary and civil
oniicers, while hotly pursued by infuriated
insurgents, sought refuge on board the
lInited States warship Bennington. then
lying in Cential American'ports. Although
the practice of asylum is not favored by
this government, yet, in view of the ImÂ­
mlinent peril which threatened the fuTiÂ­
tives and solely for conslderations of huÂ­
htanity, they were afforded shelter by our
naval coolandaier, and, when they were
aftersward delnanded unlder cur treaty of
extradition with Salvador for trial on
charges of murder, arson and robbery, I
directed thatt such of them as had not
voluntarlly left the ship be conveyed to
one of our nearest ports, where a hearing
could be heard before a judicial officer in
compliance with the terms of the treaty.
On their arrival at San Francisco, such a
proceeding was promptlyÂ­ instituted before
the United States district judge, who held
that the acts constituting the alleged
offences were political, and discharged ,ill
the accused except one Cienfuegos, who
was held for act attempt to murder. ThereÂ­

Tue Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth
Amendments to the Constitutina of the
I'ni.ed States, embodying the results of the
war for the Union, axe inviolable. If called
to the Presidency I should deem it my duty
to resi9t with all my power any attempt to
impair or evade the lull force and effect of
the Constitution, which in every article, secÂ­
tion and amendment is the supreme Inw of
the land. The Constitution forms the basis
of the Government of the United States. The
powers granted by it to the Legislative, ExÂ­
ecutive and Judicial Departments define and
limit the authority of the General GovernÂ­
ment. Powers not delegated to the United
States by the Constitution nor prohibited
by it to the States belong to the States reÂ­
spectively, or to the people. The General
and State Governments, ea-.-h acting in its
own sphi-re, without trenchirg upon the
lawful jurisliction of the other, constitute
the Union. This Union, comprising a GenÂ­
eral Government with general powers, and
State Governments with State powers for
purposes local to the States, is a polity the
foundations of which were laid in the proÂ­
foundest wisdom. This is the Union our faÂ­
thers made, and which has been so reapecte 1
abroad and so beneficent at home. Tried by
blood and fire, it stands to-day a model form
of free popular government,"" a political sysÂ­
tem which, rightly administered, has been,
and will continue to be, the admiration of
the world. May we not say, nearly in the
words of Washington: ""'The unity of the GovÂ­
ernment which constitutes one people is justÂ­
ly deirto us; it is the main pi 1 1 arm the edifice
of our real independence, the support of our
peace, safety and prosperity, aud of that libÂ­
erty we so highly prize, and intend at every
hazard to preserve.""
TUB ADMINISTRATION OF GOVERNMENT AND
LAW.
But no form of Government, however careÂ­
fully devised no principles, however sound
will protect the rights of the people unless
its administration is faithful and ellicient. It
is a vital principle in our system that neither
fraud nor force nuist be allowed to subvert
the lights of the people. When fraud, vioÂ­
lence or incompetence controls, the noblest
-Constitutions and wisest laws are useless,
rjje bayonetis not a fit instrument for colÂ­
lecting"" the votes for freemen. It is only by
a tull ""vote, free ballot and fair count that"" the
people can rule in fact, as required by the
theory of our Government, Take this founÂ­
dation away, and the whole structure falls.
Public office is a trust, not a bounty beÂ­
stowed upon the holder. No incompetent
or dishonest person should ever be trusted
with it, or, if appointed, they should promptÂ­
ly be ejected.
Our material interests, varied and progress

ive, demand our constant and united ellorts.
A sedulous and scrupulous care of the pubÂ­
lic credit, together with a wise and economÂ­
ical management of our Governmental exÂ­
penditures, should be maintained, in order
that labor may be lightly burdened, and that
all persons may be priiected in their right to
the fruits of their own industry.
The time has come to enloy the substanÂ­
tial benefits of reconciliation. As one peoÂ­
ple, we have common interests. Let us enÂ­
courage harmony and generous rivalry among
our own industries, which will revive our lanÂ­
guishing merchant-marine, extend our comÂ­
merce with foreign nations, assist our merÂ­
chants, manufacturers and producers to deÂ­
velop our vast'natural resources and increase
the prosperity and happiness of our people.
CONCLUSION.
If elected, I shall, with Divine favor, labor
with what ability I possess to discharge my
duties with fidelity, according to my convicÂ­
tions, and shall take care to protect and deÂ­
fend the Union, and to see tiat the laws be
faithfully and equally executed in all parts of
the countrv alike. I will assume the responÂ­
sibility, fully sensible of the fact that to ad
minister rigutly the functions or Government
is to discharge the most sacred duty that can
devolve upon an American citizen.

WILLIAM H. ENGLISH.
Indianapolis, Ind., July 35.
Hon. William H. English transmitted
the following letter of acceptance of the
nomination of candidate forVice-President
to the Committee of Notification toÂ­
day:To the Hon. John W. Stevenson, President of
t lie Convention: the Hon. John H. Stix-kton,
Chairman, and other members of the ComÂ­
mittee of Noiitka ion: .
Gentlemen: I have now the honor to reÂ­
ply to your letter of the 13th inst., informing
me that 1 was unanimously nominated for the
ollice of Vice-President of the United States
by the lale Democratic National Convention
which a.-sembitd at Cincinnati. As foreÂ­
shadowed in the verbal remarks made by me
at the time of the delivery of your letter, I
have now to say that I accept the high trust
with arealiz n? sense of the responsibility,
and an profoundly grateful for the honor
conferred.
THE PLATFORM GENERAL HANCOCK ETC.
I accept the nomination upon the platform
of principles adopted by the Convention,
which I cordially approve, and I accept it
quite as much because of my faith iu the
wisdom and patriotism of the great statesÂ­
man and soldier nominated on the same
ticket for President of the United States.
His eminent services to bis country, his fidelÂ­
ity to the Constitution, the Union and the
laws, his clear perception of the correct prinÂ­
ciples of government as taught by Jefferson,
bis scrupulous care to keep the military in
strict subordination to the civil authoiity,
his high regard for civil liberty, personal
rights and rights of property, his acknowlÂ­
edged ability in civil as well as military
affairs, and his pure and blameless life, all
point to him as a man worthy of the confiÂ­
dence of the people. Not only a brave solÂ­
dier, a great commander, a wise statesman
and a pure patriot, but a prudent, painstaking,
practical man of unquestioned honesty, trustÂ­
ed often with important public duiies, faithÂ­
ful to every trust, and in the full meridian of
ripe and vigorous manhood, he is in my
judgment eminently fitted for the highest
ollice on earth, the Presidency of the United
States. Not only is he the right man for the
place, but the time has come when the best
interests of the country require that the party
which has monopolized the Executive DeÂ­
partment of the General Government for the
last twenty years should be retired. The conÂ­
tinuance of that party in power four years
longer would not be beneficial to the public
or in accordance with the spirit of our repubÂ­
lican institutions. The laws of entail have
not been favored in our system of governÂ­
ment. The perpetuation of property or place
in one family or set of men has never been
encouraged in this country, and the great and
good men who formed our Republican GovÂ­
ernment and its traditions wisely limited the
tenure of office, and in many ways showed
their disapproval of long lea-es of power.
Twenty years of continuous power is long
enough, and has already led to irregularities
and corruptions which are not likelvto be
prorerly exposed under the same party that
penietrated tliem.
Besides, it shou'd not be forgotten that the
last four years of power he. a by that party
were secure! by discreditable means and held
in defiance of the wishes of the majority of
the people. It was a grievous wrons to every
voter and to our system of self-govt-rment
w hich should never"" be for.-otten or forgiven.
Many of the men now in ollice w re put there
because ol corrupt artisan services in thus
defeating the fairly and legally expressed
will of the maj irity, and the hv p x-risy oi the
professions ot that party in favor of civilÂ­
service reform was shown by i lacing such
men in office, and turning the whole brood
of Federal officeholders loose to influence the
elections. The money of the people, taken
out of the public Treasury by these men for
services often poorly performed, or not perÂ­
formed at all. is bein: used iu vast sums
with the knowledge and presumed
sanction of the Administration to control
the elections, and even the members of
the Cabinet are strolling about the country
making partisan speeches, instead of beincin
their Departments at Washington discharging
the public duiies for w hich they are paid by
the people; but, wiih ail their cleverness and
abi ity. a discriminating public will no doubt
read between the lines of their speeches that
their j.jj amount hope and aim are to keep
themselves or their satellites four vears
longer in office. Peretuating the power of j
chronic Federal officeholders four years longer
viil not benefit ihe miiiions of nica and women

who hold no office, hut earn theft- dally bread
by honest industry. This th same discrimÂ­
inating public will nodoabt folly understand,
as they will also that it ia becmusa of their
owd industry and economy and God's bountiÂ­
ful harvests that the country is comparatively
prospeious, and not because of anything done
by these Federal officeholders. The country
is comparatively prosperous, not because of
them, but in spite ot toein.
TUB CONTEST
is, in fact, between the people endeavoring to
?:ain the political power which rightfully beÂ­
ungs to them and to restore the pure, simple,
economical Constitutional Government of our
fathers on the one side, and 100,000 Federal
officeholders and their backer, pampered
with place aud power, and determined to reÂ­
tain them at all hazards, on the other. Hence
the constant assumption of new and dangerÂ­
ous power by the Uene-al Government
under the Republican party; the effort to
build npwhat they call a strong Government;
the interference with borne ruie and with the
administration of justice in the courts of the
several States; the interference with the
elections through the medium of paid partiÂ­
san officeholders interested in keepinz their
party in power, and caring more for that than
tairoess in elections; in fact, the constant
encroachments which have been made by
that party upon the clearly-reserved rights of.
the people and the States will, il not
checked, subvert the liberties of the people
and the Government of limited powers
created by the fathers, and end in a great
consolidated, concentrated Government,
strong, indeed, for evil and the overthrow of
republican institutions. The wise men who
framed our Constitution knew the evils of a
itionz Government and the long continuance
of political power in the same hands. They
knew there was a tendency in this direction
in all Governments, and consequent dan per
in republican institutions from that cause,
and look pains to guard against it. The maÂ­
chinery of a slroni; centralized General GovÂ­
ernment can be used to perpetuate the same
set of men in power from term to term until
it ceases to be a Republic, or such only in
Dame, and the tendency of the party now in
power is in that direction, as shown in variÂ­
ous ways. Besides, the willingness recently
manifested hy a large number of that party to
elect a President for an unlimited number of
terms is quite apparent, and must satisfy
thinking people that the time has come when
it will be safest and best for that party to be
retired.
TUB RIGHTS AND POWERS OF THE GENERAL
GOVERNMENT.
But in resisting the encroachments of the
General Government upon the reserved rights
of the people and the States, I wish to be disÂ­
tincly understood as favoring the proper exÂ­
ercise by the General Government of tho
powers rightfully belonging to it under the
Constitution. Encroachments upon the ConÂ­
stitutional rights of the General Government,
or interference with the proper exercise of its
powers, must be carefully avoided. The
Union of the States under the Constitution
must be maintained, and it is well known that
this has always been the position of both the
candidates on the Democratic Presidential
ticket. It is acquiesced in everywhere now,
and finally and forever settled as one of the
results of the war. It is certain beyond all
question that the legitimate results of the
war for the Union will not be overthrown or
impaired should the Democratic ticket be
elected. In that event proper protection will
lie given in every legitimate way to every citiÂ­
zen, native or adopted, in every teetion of the
Republic in the enjoyment of all the rights
guaranteed by the Constitution and its
amendments.
FINANCIAL THE INDUSTRIAL AND ECSINESS
INTERESTS.
A sound currency of honest money, of a
value and purchasing power corresponding
substantially with the standard recognized by
the commercial wor d, and consisting of gold
and silver, and paper convertible into coin,
will be maintained.
The labor and manufacturing, commercial
and business in erests of the country will tie
favored and encouraged in every legitimate
way. The toiling of our own people will be
protected from the destructive competition
of the Chines', and to that end their immiÂ­
gration to our shores will be properly reÂ­
stricted. The public credit will be scrupuÂ­
lously maintained and strengthened by rk'id
cconomv in public expenditures, and the libÂ­
erties of the people and the property of the
fieople will be protected by a Government of
aw and order administered strictly in the inÂ­
terests of all the people, and not of corporaÂ­
tions and privileged classes.

CONCH SION.
I do not doubt the discrinrnating justice
of the people and their capacity for intelliÂ­
gent self government, and, therefore, do not
doubt the succussrif the Democratic ticket.
Its success would bury beyond resurrection
the sectional jealousies and hatred which
have so Ions been the chief stock in tra le of
pestiferous demagogues, and in no ether way
can this be so ciiecnally accr inp'istied. It
would restore harmony and good feeling beÂ­
tween all the sections, and make us in fact,
as well as in name, one people. The only
rivalry then would be in the race for the deÂ­
velopment of ma'erial prosperity, the elevaÂ­
tion of labor, the enlargement of human
riijhts, the promotion of education, morality,
religion, liberty, order, and all that would
tend to make us the foremost Nation of the
earth in the grand march of human progress.
I am, with great repeet, very truly yours,
William 11. English.
Inherited Antipathies,
Cows hate dogs instinctively, from
their earliest calfhood upward. 1 used
to doubt oncti upon a time whether the
hatred was not of artilicial origin and
wholly induced by the inveterate human
habit of eggiuw on every dog to worry
every other animal that comes in its
way. Cut I tried a mild experiment
one day by putting a half-grown town
bred puppy into a small enclosure with
some hitherto unworricd calves, and
they all turned to make a common headÂ­
way against the intruder with the same
striking unanimity as the most ancient
and experienced cows. Hence I am
inclined to suspect that the antipathy
docs actually result from a vaguely inÂ­
herited instinct derived from the days
when the ancestors of our kine was a
wild urus, and the ancestor of our dogs
a wolf, on the wild forest-clad plains of
Central Europe. When a cow puts up
its tail at sight of a dog entering its padÂ­
dock at the present day it has probably
some dim instinctive consciousness that
it stands in the presence of a dangerous
hereditary foe; and as the wolves could
only seize with safety a single isolated
urus, so the cows now usually make
common cause against the intruding
dog, turning their heads in one direcÂ­
tion with very unwonted unanimity till
his tail finally disappears under the opÂ­
posite gate.
Such inherited antipathies seem comÂ­
mon and natural enough. Every species
knows and dreads the ordinary enemies
of its race. Mice scamper away from
the yery smell of a cat. Young chickÂ­
ens run to the shelter f their mother's
wings when the shadow of a hawk
passes over their heads. Mr. Darwin
put a small snake into a paper bag,
which he gave to the monkeys at the
Zoo; and one monkey after another
opened the bag, looked in upon the
deadly foe of the quadrumanous kind,
and promptly dropped the whole packÂ­
age with every gesture of horror and
dismay. Even man himself though
his instincts have all weakened so
greatly with the growth of his more
plastic intelligence, adapted to a wider
and more modifiable set of external cirÂ­
cumstances seems to retain a vague and
original terror of the serpentine form.

Mrt. M. A. Vedder finds that water

This being the case, considerable risk
must attend the use of such ice in drinkÂ­

MEDICINE AS PRACTISED BY ANIMALS.



M.	G. DELAUNAY, in a recent commu-

Bication to the Bioloolcal Socie tv, ob-

b

served that medicine, as practised by

animals, is thoroughly empirical, but that

the same may be said of that practised

by inferior human races, or, in other

words, by the majority of the human spe-

cies. Animals instinctively choose such

food as is best suited to them. M. Dc-

launay maintains that the human race also

shows this instinct, and blames medical

men for not paying sufficient respect to

the likes and dislikes of the patients,

~vhich he believes to be a guide that may

be depended on. Women are more often

hungry than men, and they do not like

the same kinds of food; nevertheless, in

asylums for aged poor, men and women

are put on precisely the same regimen.

Infants scarcely weaned are given a diet

suitable to adults, meat and ~vine which

they dislike and which disagree with them.

M. Delaunay investigated this question

in the different asylums of Paris, and as-

certained that children do not like meat

before they are about five years of age.

People who like salt, vinegar, etc., ought

to be allowed to satisfy their tastes. Lo-

rain always taught that with regard to

food, peoples likings are the best guide.

A large number of animals wash them-

selves and bathe, as elephants, stags,

birds, and ants. M. I)elaunay lays down

as a general rule, that there is not any

species of animal which voluntarily runs

the risk of inhaling emanations arising

from their own excrement. Some ani-

mals def~cate far from their habitations;

others bury their excrement; others carry

to a distance the excrement of their young.

In this respect they show more foresight

than man, who retains for years excre-

ment in stationary cesspools, thus origi-

nating epidemics. If we turn our atten-

tion to the question of reproduction, we

shall see that all mammals suckle their

young, keep them clean, wean them at the

proper time, and educate them; but these

maternal instincts are frequently rudi-

mentary in women of civilized nations.

In fact, man may take a lesson in hygiene

from the lower animals. Animals get rid

of their parasites by using dust, mud,

clay, etc. Those suffering from fever

restrict their diet, keep quiet, seek dark-

ness and airy places, drink water, and

sometimes even plunge into it. When

a dog has lost its appetite, it eats that

species of grass known as dogs grass

(chiendent), which acts as an emetic and

purgative. Cats also eat grass. Sheep

and cows, when ill, seek out certain herbs.

When dogs are constipated they eat fatty

substances, such as oil and butter, with

avidity, until they are purged. The same

thing is observed in horses. An animal

that this little organ, by its ceaseless

industry, actually lifts the enormous
weight of three hundred and seventy
million, seven hundred thousand,
two hundred tons in a life time of
sixty years.

The lungs contain about one galÂ­

To the Senate and"" House of Representatives
of the United States:
FELLoW-CITIZENs :





You'have been assembled in your respecÂ­ ti
tive halls of legislation under a proclamation o
bearing the signature of the illustrious citiÂ­ tl
zen who was.so lately called by the direct ii
suffrages of the people to the discharge of p
the important functions of their chief exeÂ­ p
cutive office. Upon the expiration of a sinÂ­ i
gle month from the day of his installation, r
he has paid the great debt of nature, learÂ­ e
ing behind him a name associated with the p
recollection of numerous benefits, conferred t
upon the country during a lbng life of patriÂ­ r
otic devotion. With this public bereaveÂ­ t
ient are connected other considerations
which will not escape the attention of ConÂ­ '1
gtess. The preparations necessary for his r
removal to the seat of Government in view t
of a residence of four years must have deÂ­ t
volved upon the late President hesivy expenÂ­ s
ditures; which, if permitted to burden the c
limited resources of his private fortune, may c
tend seriously to the embarrassment of his Â¶
, urviving family ; and it is therefore respectÂ­ i
fully submitted to Congress whether the orÂ­ t
dinary p:inciples of justice would 'not dicÂ­
e
tate .the propriety of its legislative interposiÂ­ i
ti; :By the provisiops of the fundamental i
lawr, the powers and duties of the high staÂ­ I
tion to which he was elected have devolved
upon me, and in the dispositions of the repÂ­
resentatives of the States and of the people
will be found to a great extent a solution of
the problem to which our institutions are for
the first time subjected.
In entering upon the duties of this office,
I did not feel that it would be becoming in
me to disturb what had been ordered by my
lamented predecessor. Whatever therefore
may have been my opinion, originally, as to
the propriety of convening Congiess at so
early a day from-that of its late adjournment,
I found a new and a controlling inducement
not to. interfere with the patriotic desires of
the late President, in the novelty of the situÂ­
ation in which I was so unexpectedly placed.
My first wish, under such circumstances,
would necessarily have been to have called
to my aid, in the administration of public afÂ­
fairs, the combined wisdom of the.two Houses
of Congress, in order 'to take their counsel
and advice as to the best mode of extricatÂ­
ing the Government and the country from
the embarrassments weighing heavily on
both.
I am then most happy in finding myÂ­
self, so soon after my accession to the PresiÂ­
dency, surrounded by the immediate repreÂ­
resentatives of the States and people.
No important changes having taken place
in our foreign relations since the last session
of Congress, it is not deemed necessary on
this occasion to go into a detailed statement
in regard to them. I am happy to say that
I see nothing:to destroy the hope of being
able to preserve peace.
The ratification of the treaty with PortuÂ­
gal has been duly exchanged between the
two Governments. This Government has
not been inattentive to the interests of those
of our citizens who have claims on the GovÂ­
-0rtnerafenSjpa-in sr i-oi0pr-aaÂ­ tea-y .
stipulations, and a hope is indulged that the
representations which have been made to
that Government on this subject may lead
ere long to beneficial'results.
A correspondence has taken place between
the Secretary of State and the Minister of
Her Britannic Majesty accredited to this
Government, on the subject of Alexander
MeLeod's indictment and imprisonment, coÂ­
pies of p.hich are herewith communicated
to Congress.
In addition to what appears from these paÂ­
pers, it may be proper to state that AlexanÂ­
der McLeod has been heard by the Supreme
Court of the State of New York on his moÂ­
tion to be discharged from imprisonment,
and that the decision of that Court has not


as yer aeen proiiuunceu.
The'Secretary of State has addressed to
me a paper upon two subjects, interesting to
'the commerce of the country, which will reÂ­
ceive my consideration, and which I have
the honor to communicate to Congress.
So far as it depends on the course of this
Government, our relations of good-will and
'friendship will be sedulously cultivated with
all nations. The true American policy will
be found to consist in the'exercise of a spiÂ­
rit of justice to be manifested in the disÂ­
charge of all our international obligations,
to the'weakest of the family of nations, as
well as to the most powerful. Occasional
conflicts of opinion may arise, but when the
discussionsÂ­ incident to them are conducted
ia the language of truth, and with a strict
regard to justice, the scourge of war will for
the most part be avoided. The time ought
to be regarded as having gone by when a reÂ­
sobrt'to arms is to be esteemed as the only
proper arbiter of national differences.
The census recently taken shows a reguÂ­
tpnn the breaking out of the war of the teÂ­
volution, ourtnumbers scarcely equilled three
millions of souls; they already:exceed sevÂ­
enteen millions, and will continue to proÂ­
gress in a ratio which (luplicates in a period
of abouttwenty-threeyears. The old States
contain a territory sufficient in itself to mainÂ­
tain a population of additional millions,,and
the most populous of the new States may
even yet be regarded as -but partially setÂ­
tled, while of the new lands on this side of
the Rocky Mountains, to say nothing of the
immense region which stretches from the
base of those mountains to the mouth of the
Columbia river,.about 770,000,000 of acres,
ceded and unceded,still remain to be brought
into market. We hold out to the people of
other countries an invitation to come and
settle
among us as members of our rapidlyÂ­
growing-family ; and, for the blessings which
.we offer them, we require of"" them to look
:upon our country as their country, and to
unite with us in the great task.of preserving
our institutions, and thereby perpetuating
o.ur liberties. No motive exists for foreign
conquest.: We .desire but to reclaim our alÂ­
mQaosttillimitable wild6crnesses, and to introÂ­
,d'uceeinto their depths the lights of civilizaÂ­
tion. While we shall at all times he pre'Â­
pared to vindicate the national honor, our
mostÂ­ earnest desireÂ­ wiB be to maintain an
unbroken peace.




 In presenting the foregoing views, 1 canÂ­ ta
not withhold the expression of the opinion ar
that there exists fiothing in the extension of cr
our empire over our coknowledged possesÂ­ te
sions to excite the alarm of the patriot for in
the safety of our insiutions. The FederaÂ­ St
tive system, leaving to each State the care gi
of its domestic concerns, and devolving on a:
the Federal Government those of general pc
import, admits in safety of the greatest exÂ­ in
pansion, but, at the same time, I deem it St
proper to add that there will be found to ex-as
ist at all times an imperious necessity for g;
restraining all the functionaries of this GovÂ­ nm
ernment within the range of their respective e;
powers, thereby preserving a just balance ti
between the powers granted to this GovernÂ­ li
rient and those reserved to the States and to p
the people. ti
From the report of the Secretary of the tl
Treasury, you will perceive that the fiscal p
means present and accruing are insufficient o
to supply the wants of the Government for ii
the current year. The balance in the TreaÂ­ u
sury on the fourth day of March 'last, not d
covered by outstanding drafts, and exclusive a
of trust funds, is estimated at $860,000.Â­ a
This includes the sum of $215,000 deposited d
in the mint and its branches to procure meÂ­ e
tal for coining and in process of coinage, v
and which!icould not be withdrawn without 6
inconvenience.; thus leaving subject to0draft e
l in the various depositoiies the sum of $645Â­ r
- 000. By virtue of two eral acts of ConÂ­ r
I gress, the Secretary of the Treasury was auÂ­ r
- thorized to issue, on and after the fourth day E
of March last, Treasury notes to the amount
f of $5,413,000, nlmaking an aggregate availaÂ­
r ble fund of $6,058,000 on hand. t
But this fund was chargeable with outÂ­ E
, standing Treasury notes redeemable in the c
a current yeir and interest thereon to the es-""
y timated amount of five millioi two hundred I
e
and eighty thousand dollars. There is also t
o
thrown upon the Treasury the payment of a
o large amount of demands accrued in whole

of the country, growing' out of pre-existing

' Under asystem of discritniÂ­
y nating duties imposed for purposes of reveÂ­
nue, in unison with the provisions of, exist-Â­
f ing laws, it is: to be hoped that our policy
e
will, in the future, be fixed and permanent,
e so as to avoid those constant fluctuations
e
which defeat thp very objects they have in
i, view. We shall thus best maintain a posiÂ­
it
tion which, while it will enable us the more
f readily to meet the advances of other counÂ­

commerce; will at the 'same, time leave in
h our own hands the means of i'retaliating with

1Â­
bursement of the public revenues, i-rnderi ng
- more secure their custody, aid consulting a
i. true economy i n the great multi plied and del.
' icate operations of the Treasury Depiartment.
Ir Upon such an age'nt depends,.in 'in eminent
n, 'degree, the establishment of a currency of
uniformvalue,'-which is of so great impor.

 tance to all the essential interests of society, ac
and on: the wisdom to be manifested in its ot;
creation much depends;. So intimately inÂ­ ty
terwoven are-its operations, not only with the th
interests of individuals, but with those of the th
States, that it may be regarded in a great deÂ­ th
gree as controlling both. If paper be used be
as the chief medium of circulation, and the se
power be vested in the Government of issuÂ­ di
ing it at pleasure, either in the form of TreaÂ­ cr
sury drafts or any other, or if Banks be used do
ag the public depositories, with liberty to reÂ­ th
gard all surplusses from day to day, as so wv
much added to their active capital, prices are fo
exposed to constant fluctuations, and indusÂ­ sp
try to severe suffering. In the one case, poÂ­ in
litical considerations, directed to party purÂ­ th
poses, may control, while excessive cupidiÂ­ it:
ty may prevail in the other. .The public is na
thus constantly liable to imposition. - ExÂ­ in
pansions and contractions may follow each it
other in rapid succession, the one engenderÂ­ tl:
ing a reckless spirit of adventure and specÂ­ '
ulation, which embraces States as well as inÂ­ ol
dividuals ; the other causing a fall in prices, je
and accomplishing an entire change in the ir
aspect of affairs. Stocks of all kinds rapidly ai
decline-individuals are ruined, and States tc
embarrassed even in their efforts to meet st
with punctuality the interest on their debts. c
Such, unhappily, is the state of things now N
existing in the Unitcd States.Â­ .These effects si
may readily be traced: to the c?.-es above o
referred to. The public revenueon being c
removed from the then Bank 6f. ''ll UnitedÂ­ n
States, under an order of a late President, c
were placed in selected State Banks, which, a:
actuated by the double motive ofconciliating 0
the Government and augmenting their proÂ­ rt
fits to the greatest possible'extent,.enlarged s,
extravagantly their discounts, thus enabling .t(
all othei existing Banks to do the same.-Â­ a
Lirge dividends were declared, which, stimÂ­ c
Âº
uiating the cupidity of capitalists, caused a je
t
rush to be made to the Legislatures of the e
respective States for similar acts of incorpo.Â­ V
'ration, which, by many of the States, under o
Ia tempoiary infatuation, were readily grantÂ­
ed, and thus the augmentation of. the circuÂ­ n
I
lating medium, consisting almost exclusiveÂ­ i.
ly of paper, produced a most fatal delusion. W
An illustration, -derived from the land sales tl
i
of the period alluded to, will serve best to rn
show the effect of the whole system. The c,
average sales of the public lands, for a periÂ­ fc
f
od of ten years prior to 1834, had rat much tl
exceeded $2,000,000 per annum. In 1834 a
they attained, in round numbers, to the s,
i
amount of $6,000,000. In the succeeding o
year of 1835 they reached $16,000,000. And ii
the.next year, of 1836, they amounted to the ii
enormous sum of $25,000,000. Thus crowd. d
ring
into the short space of -three years upÂ­ si
wards of twenty-three years' purchase of the o
public domain. So apparent had become the o
f
necessity of arresting this course of things, a
that the Executive department assumed the d
highly questionable power of discriminating p
in the funds to be used in pa)yment by difÂ­ ti
ferent classes of public debtors--a discrimiÂ­ e
f nation which was doubtless designed to corÂ­ c
3
rect this most ruinous state of things.by the t<
1
exaction of specie in all payments for the
public lands, but which could not at once o
. arrest the tide which had so strongly set in. ii
- Hence the demands for specie became unÂ­ r
i ceasing, arid. correspondil 'rostilatin rÂ­ a
1
pidly ensued under the necessities creaÂ­ s.
- ted with the Banks to curtail their discounts, d
- and thereby to reduce their circulation. A
I recur to these things with no disposition o
f to censure pre-existing administrations of si
the Government, but simply.in exemplifieaÂ­ tl
, tion of the truth of the position which I have v
Sassumed. If,then,any fiscal agent which may a
f be created shall be placed, without ldue reÂ­ d
t strictions, either in the hands of the adminisÂ­ a


trators of the Government, or those of private t4
e
individuals, the temptation to abuse will o
, prove to be resistless. Objects of political a
a aggrandizement may seduce the first, and a
- the promptings of a boundless cupidity will a
assail the last. Aided by the experience of f'
the past, it will be the pleasure of Congress t
so to guard and 'fortify the public interests, fi
, in the creation of any new agent, as to place n
t them, so far as human wisdoim cars accomÂ­ r
plish it, on a footing of perfect 'security.Â­ s
[1 Within a few years past, three different C
d schernms have been before the country. The I
s charter of the Bank of the United States exÂ­ a
I pired by its own limitation in 1836. An t
e effort was made to renew it, which receivÂ­ n
d
ed the sanction of the two Houses of ConÂ­ t
gress, but the then President of the United I
StatesÂ­ exercised' his veto power, and the d
aÂ­ measure was defeated. A regard to truth a
requires me to say that the President was a
- fully sustained in the course he had taken e
v by the popular voice. His successor in the s
Chair of State unqualifiedly pronounced his t
tÂ­ opposition to any new charter of a similar c
a institution; and not only the popular elec-. c
s tion which brought him into power, but the 1
elections through much of his term, seemed
clearly to indicate a concurrence with him I
t in sentiment on the part of the people. After
,..the public moneys were wit ldragn fromthe I
Unltecr states 'anl, tney were plced ti'deÂ­
s posite with the State baniks, andÂ­ the result
.t of that policy has been before the country.
, To say nothing as to the question whether
n that experiment was made under propitious
e
or adverse circumstances, it may safely be 4
asserted that (it did 'receive the unqualified
condemnation of most of its early advocates,
and it is believed was also condemned by
the popular sentiment. The existing subÂ­
y
Treasury system does not seem to stand in
t, higher favor with the people, but has recentÂ­
s ly been condemned in a mannei too plainly
n
indicated to admit of a doubt. !Thus, in the
short period of eight years, the popular voice
e may be regarded as having successively conÂ­
demned each of the three schemes of finance
d to which I have adverted. As to the first,
n it was introduced at a time (1816) Wivhen the
h
State banks, then comparatively few in numÂ­
ber, had been forced to suspend specie payÂ­
n ments, by reason of'the""warW;lefeig&had preÂ­
,r
viously prevailed with Great Britain: WhethÂ­
m.
er, if thle United States Bank charter which
9Â­ epired in 1811 had been renewed in due seaÂ­
g son, it would have been enabled to continue
a specie payments during the war and the disasÂ­
b trous period to the commerce: of the counÂ­
t. try wlhichimrnediately succeeded, is, to say
it the least, problematieal: and whether the
Af United States Bank"" of 1816 produced a resÂ­
rÂ­ toration of specie payments, or the same was

 accomplished through the instrumentality of at
other means, was a matter of some difficulÂ­ u;
ty at that time to determine. Certain it is, of
that, for the first years of the operation of ol
that bank, its course was as disastrous as for bi
the greater part of its subsequent career it it
became eminently successful. As to the of
second, the experiment was tried with a reÂ­ 6i
dundant Treasury, which continued to inÂ­ b;
crease until it seemed to be the part of wisÂ­ hi
I dom to distribute the surplus revenue among rt
the States, which, operating at the same time pi
with the specie circular, and the causes beÂ­ C
fore adverted to, caused' them to suspend n<
specie payments, and involved the country ol
in the greatest embarrassment. And, as to ai
the third, if carried through all the stages of In
its transmutation, from paper and specie to si
s
nothing but the precious metals, to say nothÂ­
- ing of the insecurity of the public moneys, te
i
its injurious effects have been anticipated by Si
the country in its unqualified condemnation. of
What is now to be regarded as the judgment T
of the American people on this whole subÂ­ m
, ject, I have no accurate means of determinÂ­ w
e
ing, but by appealing-to their more immediÂ­ si
y
ate representatives. 'The late contest which is
s terminated in the election of Gen. HARRIÂ­ ic
St sO to the.Presidency, was decided on prinÂ­ g
i.
ciples well known and openly declared : and, tl
v while the sub-Treasury received in the reÂ­ 1
:s sult the most decided condemnation, yet no s
e othci. scheme of finance seemed to hav'e been :i
g coneurrid in. To your-, theni, who have come v
dÂ­ more-directly from,the body of our common
r,
constituents, 1 submit the entire question, i
i,
as best qualified to give a full exposition
g of their wishes. and opinions. I shall be f
- ready to concur with you in the adoption of e
d such system as you may propose, reserving t
g .to myself the ultimate power of rejecting c
any measure'which may in my view of it r
mÂ­
conflict with the Constitution, or otherwise t
a jeopard the prosperity of the country;Â­ a powÂ­ L
e er which I could not part with even if I i
. would, but which I will not believeÂ­ any act e
r of yours will call into requisition.
- n
tÂ­
I cannot avoid recurring, in connexion t
iÂ­
with this subject, to the necessity which exÂ­ s
ists for adopting some suitable measure t
. vhereby the unlimited creation of banks by e
s the States may be corrected in fuiture. Sutch a
o result-can be most readily achieved by the
e consent of the States, to be expressed in the tb
form .of a compact among themselves, which c
h they can only enter into with the consent s
4 and approbation of--thisGovernment.;.a conÂ­ t
e sent which might, in the present emergency e
g of the public demands, justifiably be given a
d in advance of any action by the States as an i
e inducerient to such action upon terms well t'
I. defined by the act of tender. Such a meaÂ­ t
)Â­
sure, addressing itself to the calm reflection c
e of-the States, would find in the experience o
,e
of the past, and the condition of the present, S
s,
much to sustain it. And it is greatly to be o
e doubted whether any scheme ofrfinance can p
g prove for any length of time successful, while c
fÂ­
-the States shall continue in the uniestrained ii
iÂ­
exercise of the power of creating banking a
rÂ­
corporations. This power can only-be limi-. c
e ted by their consent. a' a
e With the adoptionÂ­ of a financial agency s
e of a satisfactory character, the hope may be r
. indulged that the country may -onceÂ­ more f
- return, to a state of prosperity. Measures .d
t_ auxi Ii.y (yheieto,' :t in--some measure, nÂ­ u
m.
separably connected with its success, will d
, doubtless claim the attention of Congress.Â­ o
. Among such, a distrbution of the proceeds e
n of the sales of the public lands, provided p
>f
such distfri bution does not force upon Congress a
1Â­
the necessity of imposing upon commerce heaÂ­ s
e vier burdens than those contemplated by the E
y act of 1833, would act as an efficient remeÂ­
- dial measure by being brought directly in t

;e to the task of preserving a just balance in 1
II our system of government, by the nmaintenÂ­ r
l1 ance of the States in a condition the most free r
d and respectable, and in the full possession t
11
of all.their power, I can no otherwise than t
)f'
feel desirous for their emancipation from
,s
the situation to which the pressure on their t
s,
finances'now subjects them. And, while 1 c
:e
must repudiate as a measure founded in. erÂ­
1Â­ roreaid wantiug:eonstitutional sanction,-the r
- slightest approach to an assumption by this I
it
Government of the debts of the States, yet i
Ie I can see, in the distribution adverted to, r
cÂ­
much to recommend it. The compacts beÂ­ c
.n tween the proprietor States and-this Govern.
vÂ­ ment expressly guaranty to the States all the <
1Â­ benefits which may arise from the sales.Â­
d The mode by which this is to be effected adÂ­
ie dresses itself to the discretion of Congress,
:h as the trustee for the States; and its exercise, t
is
after the most beneficial manner, is restrainÂ­
tn
ed by nothing in the grants or in -the ConÂ­
ie stitution, so long as Congress shall consult
is that equality in the distribution which the
ar compacts require. In the present condition
c-. of some of the States, the question of distriÂ­
he
bution may he regarded as substantially a
qd question between direct and indirect taxation.
m If the distribution he not made.in some form
er or other, the necessity will daily become
be more urgent with the debtor States for a reÂ­
eÂ­ sort tf
i anr oppressive systemi 6o direct taxaÂ­
tlt
tion, or their credit, and necessarily, their
y. power and influence, will be greatly diminÂ­
er ished. The payment of taxes, after the most
us inconvenient and oppressive mode, will be
be
exacted in place of contributions for the
ed
most part voluntarily made, and therefore
s, comparatively unoppressive. The States are
by
emphatically the constituents of this GovernÂ­
bÂ­ ment; and we should be entir.ely regardless
in of the objects held in view by them in the
atÂ­ creation of this Government if we could be
Ily
indifferent to their good. The happy effects
he of such a measure upon all the States would
cc immediately be manifested. With the debtÂ­
inÂ­ or States it would effect the relief to a great
ce extent of the citizens from a heavy burdeni
st, of direct taxation which presses with severÂ­
he ity on the laboring classes, and eminently
mÂ­ assist i-n restoring the general prosperity.-Â­
tyÂ­
An immediate advalnce wouldtake place in
reÂ­
theb:price: of the State secprities, and the atÂ­
thÂ­ tittide of the States would become once
ch more, as it should ever be, lofty and erect.
,aÂ­
With States laboring under no extreme presÂ­
ue sure fomrn debt, the fund which they would
asÂ­ derive from this sourcewuld' enable them
inÂ­ to improve their condition in an eminent dteÂ­
Say
gree. So far as this Government is:conceriiÂ­
the
-ed, appropriations tb domestic objects, apÂ­
esÂ­ oroaching in 'amount the ievenue derived'
Vas fronifthe landÂ­ sales, might 'hbe abandoned,

 and thus a system of unequal and therefore er
unjust legislation would' be substituted by du
one dispensing equality to all the members th,
of this confederacy. Whether such distriÂ­ frc
bution should be made directly to the States mi
in the proceeds of the sales, or in the form up
of profits by virtue of the operations of any
fiscal agency having those proceeds as its of
basis, should such measure be contemplated big
by Congress, would weltldeserve its consideÂ­ pc
ration. Nor would such disposition of the lic
proceeds of the sales in any manner prevent vl
Congress from time to time from passing all se;
necessary pre-emptiori laws for the benefit liti
of actual settlers, or from making any new pr
arrangement as to the price of the public on
lands which might in future be esteemed deÂ­ to
sirable. pe
I beg leave particularly to call your attenÂ­ the
tention to the accompanying report from the UI
Secretary, of War. Besides the present state en
of the war which has so long afflicted the an
Territory of Florida, and the various other sir
matters of interest therein referred to, you es(
will learn fromÂ­ it that the Secretary has in.Â­ in
stituted an'iiti4ifry into abuses which promÂ­ uti
ises to develope gross enormities in connexÂ­ de
ion with Indian treaties which have been neÂ­ any
gotiated, as well as in the expenditures for he
the removal and subsistence of the Indians. als
He represents, also, other irregularities of a thF
serious nature that hive grown up in the as
p:lractice of the Indian Department, which rc:
will require the appropriation of upWards of r'""
$200,000. to correct, and which claim the
iinmediate attention of Congress. yV
In reflecting on the proper means of, deÂ­ fo
fending the country, we cannot shut our m
eyes to the consequences which the introducÂ­ tih
tion and use of the power of steam upon the tl
ocean are likely to produce in wars between si
maritime States. We cannot yet see the exÂ­ tip
tent to which this power may be applied in in
belligerent operations, connecting itself as in
it does with recent improvements in the sciÂ­ in
ence of gunnery and projectiles; but we th
need have no fear of being left, in regard to qi
these things, behind the most active and it
skilful of other nations if the genius and enÂ­ cc
terprise of our fellow-citizens receive proper st
encouragement and direction from GovernÂ­ re
ment. th
True wisdom would, nevertheless, seem
to dictate the necessity of placing in perfect la
condition those fortifications'which are deÂ­ N
signed for the protection of our principal ciÂ­ is
ties and roadsteads. For the defence of our m
extended marifimectasf; our chief'reliance C
should be placed on our navy, aided by those ea
inventions which are destined to recommend pr
themselves to public adoption., But no pt
time should be lost in placing our principal in
cities on the seaboard and the lakes in a state
of entire security, from foreigh assault.Â­ pr
Separated as we are from the countries of the ra
old world, and in-much unaffected by their m
policy, we are happily relieved from the neÂ­ ex
cessity of maintaining large standing armies at
in time of peace. The policy which was th
adopted by Mr. Monroe, shortly after the, ha
conclusion of the late war with Great BritÂ­ an
ain, of preserving a regularly organized staff tic
sufficient for the command of a large militaÂ­ su
ry force, should a necessity for one arise, is tei
founded as well in economy as in true wisÂ­ lic
.dom. Provision is thus made, upon filling isi
up -thel:rank :andtfile. abchiÃ½ n.ra ea dilyJhal
done on any emergency, for the introduction jet
of a system of discipline both promptly and ed
efficiently. All that is required in time of sy
peace is to maintain a sufficient number of wi
men to guard our fortifications, to meet any p1
sudden contingency, and to encounter the wl
first shock of war. Our chief reliance must si
be placed on the militia. They constitute th
the great body of national guards, and, inÂ­ thI
spired by an ardent love of country, will be wi


found ready at all times and at all seasons, to ha
repair with alacrity to its defence. It will be la,
regarded byCongress, I doubt not,at asuitable fu
time, as one of its highest duties to attend to ec
their complete organization and discipline.
The state of the navy pension fund requires
the immediate attention of Congress. By the
operation of the actof the 3d of March, 1837,
entitled "" An act for the more equitahle adÂ­
ministration of the ravy pension fund,"" that sta
ftund has been exhausted. It will be seen to
from the accompanying report of the ComÂ­ en
missioner of Pensions that there will be reÂ­ so
quired for the payment of navy pensioners, o
on the first of July next, $84,006,063, and. of
on the first of January, 1842, the sum of
$60,000. In addition to these sums. about
$6,000"" will be required to .pay arrears of u
pensions, which will probably be allowed beÂ­ tl
tween the i rst of July and the first of J;tnnary, a
1842, making in the whole $150,006 063. To sl
meet these pay men ts there is within the control n
of the.Department the sum ofÂ­ $28,040,leavin d
a deficit of $121,966 06-. The public faith a
requires that immediate provision should -be e
made for the payment of these sinms ti
In order'to introduce into the navy a de a

measures of importance, in connexion with

this branch of the public service, may be maÂ­

tured for your consideration.
Although the laws-regulating the Post OfÂ­
fs fice Department only require from the officer
a
charged with its direction to report at the
e
usual annual session of Congress, the PostÂ­
Es masterm General has presented to me some
d facts connected with the financial condition
tÂ­ of the Department which are deemed worthy
it the attention of Congress. By tlre accompaÂ­
iny ring report of that officer, it appears that
rÂ­ the existing liabilities of that Department beÂ­
y yond the means of payment at its command
cÂ­ annot be less than five hundred thousand
in dolars. As the laws organizing that branch
.tÂ­
of
the public serviceeconfine the expenditure
:e
to
its own reveines. deficiencies therein canÂ­
:t.
not be presented under the usual estimates
sÂ­ for the expenses of Government. It must
Id thmerefore be left to Congress to determine
m whether the moneys now due to contractors
e shall he paid from the public Treasury, or
iiÂ­
whether that department shall continue unÂ­
der its present embrriassments. It will be
Id
seen.by the -report of-the Postmaster GeneÂ­
d, ral that the recent lettings of contracts in sevÂ­




 eral of the States have been made at such re.
duced rates of compensation as to encourage
the belief that, if the department was relieved
from existing difficulties, its future operations
might be conducted without any further call
upon the general Treasury.
The power of appointing to office is one
of a character the most delicate and responsi.
ble. Thie appointimg power is evermore-ex.
posed to be led into error. With anxious so.
licitude to select the most trust worthy for
official station, I cannot be supposed to posÂ­
sess a personal knowledge of the qualificaÂ­

proper, in this most public manner, to invite
on the part of the Senate, a just scrutiny inÂ­
to the character and pretensions of every
person whom I may bring to their notice in
the regular form of a nomination for office.
Unless persons every way trustworthy are
employed in the public service, corruption
and irregularity will inevitably follow. I
shall, with the greatest cheerfdulness, nacquiÂ­

utive department in the performance of this
delicate duty, I shall look to its ."" consent
and adtviee"" as given only in firtherance of
the best interests of the country. I shall;
also, at the earliest proper occasion, invite
the attention of Congress to such measures
as in my judgment will he best calculated to
rcagnlate and -control the Executive power in
v'Lvenr
e ton-his vitally. iml,ortant subject.
I shall also, at the proper Ã½estrsn,
invite
your attention to the statutory enactments
for the suppression of the slave trade, which
may require to be rendered more efficient in
their provisions. There is reason to believe
that the traffic is on the increase. Whether
such increase is to be ascribed to the aholi.
tion of slave labor in the British possessions
in our vicinity, and an attendant diminution
in the supply of those articles whiclh enter
into the general consumption of the wor'd,
thereby augmenting the demand from otler
quarters, and thus calling for addition:al labor,
it were needless to inquire. The highest
considerations of public honor, as well as the
strongest ptomptinius of humanity, require a
resort to the most vigorous efforts to suppress
the trade.
In conclusion, I beg to invite your particuÂ­
lar attention to the interests of this District.
Nor do I doubt that. in a liberal spirit of legÂ­
islation, you will seek to advance its comÂ­
mercial as well as its lcal interests. Should
Congress deem it to be its duty to repeal the
existing sub-Treasury law, the necessity of
providing.a suitable place of depnsite for tho
public moneys' which nay be required ivithÂ­
in the District must be apparent to all.
I.have felt it to be due to the country to
present the foregoing topics to your conisideÂ­
ration and reflection. Others, with which it
might not seem proper io trouble you at an
extraordinary session, will be laid before you
at a future day. I am happy in committing
the important affairs of the country into your
hands. The tendency of public sentiment, I
am pleased to believe, is towards the adop.
tion, in -a spirit of union and harmony, of
such measures as will fortify the public inÂ­
terests. To cherish such a tendency of pubÂ­
lic opinion is the task of an elevated patriotÂ­
ism. That differences of opinion as to the
-meann-f amm mphisgthiese .desirah!e obÂ­
jects should exist, is reasonably to be expectÂ­
ed. Nor can all be made satisfied with any
-
system of measures. But I flatter myself
with the hope that the great bodly of the peoÂ­
ple will readily u. - in support of those,
whose efforts spring from a disinterested deÂ­
sire to promote their happiness; to preserve
the Federal anti State Governments within
their resoective orbits; to cultivate peace
with all the nationtis of the earth, on jurst and
honorable grounds ; to exact obedience to the
laws; to entrench liberty andl prolIerty in
full security ; and, consulting the most rigid
economy, to abolish all useless expenses.

Resuming his dis-course, he said, "" when I Bee the queen, I think' of the Queen of Sheba, who came from the uttermost parts of the world to hear the wisdom of King Solomon.

The girlB washed up to their elbows, and the boys only to their wrists, so King Solomon was able to tell their respective sex by that method.

VICE REFORM-POLITICAL ASSESSMENTS
-THE INDIAN QUESTION, ETC.





WASHINGToN, Nov. 30.-Following is the
full text of the message of President Hayes,
to be delivered to Congress, on its assembling
to-morrow:
FEI LOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES: The members of the Forty-sixth
Congress have assembled in their regular session
under circumstances calling for mu.ual congratulaÂ­
tion and grateful acknowledgment to the giver of all
good for the large and unusual measure of national
prosperity which we now enjoy.
'1 he most interesting events which have occurred
in our public affairs since my last annual message to
Congress are connceted with the financial operations
of the Government directly affecting the business
interests of the country. I coegratu'ate Congress
on the successful execution of the resumptiori act.
At the time fixed and in the manner contemplated
by law, United States notes began to be redeemed in
coin. Since the first of January last they have been
promptly redeemed on presentation, and in all bustÂ­
ness transactions, public and private, in all parts of
the country, they are received and paid out as the
equivalent cf coin. The demand upon the Treasury
for gold and silver in exchange for United States
notes has been comparatively small, and the vo.unÂ­
tery deposit of coin and bullion in exchange for
notes has been very large. The excess of the preÂ­
cious metals deposited or exchanged for United
States notes over the amount of United States notes
redeemed is about $40,000,000.
THE RESUMPTION OF SPECIE PAYMENTS
has been followed by a very great revival of busiÂ­
ness. With a currency equivalent in value to the
money of the commercial world, we are enabled to
eLter upon an equal competition with other nat ons
in trade and production. The inc-easing foreign
demand for our manufactures and agricultural prcÂ­
ducts has caused a large balance of trade in our
favor, which has been paid in gold, from the 1st of
July last, to November 15, to the amount of about
f59,0 0,000. Since the resumption of specie payÂ­
ments there has also been a marked and gratifying
improvement of the public credit. The bonds of the
Government bearing only four per cent. interest
have been sold at or above par, sauilcient in amount
to pay off all of the national debt which was redeemÂ­
able under present laws. The amount of interest
saved annually by the process of refunding the
debt, since March 1. 1577, is $14,297,177. The bonds
sold were largely in small sums, and the number of
our citizens now holding the pub:ic securities is
much greater than ever before. The amount of the
national debt which matures within less than two
years is $792,121,700, of which $500,00( 0 bear inÂ­
terest at the rate of five per cent., and the balance is
In bonds bearing six per cent. interest. It is beÂ­
lieved that this part of the public debt can be reÂ­
funded by the issue of four per cent. bonds, and, by
the reduction of interest which will thus be effected,
about eleven millions of dollars can be annually
saved to the Treasury. To secure this important
reduction of interest to be paid by the United
Stat s, further legislation is required, which, it is
hoped, will be provided by Congress during its
present session.
The coinage of gold by the mints of the United
States, during the last fiscal year was $40,9S6,912.
The coinage of silver dodals, since the passage of
the act for that purpose. up to November 1, 1619, was
$43,000,550, of which $12.T
: .344 have been issued
from the Treasury and are 'now in circulation, and
$32,300,506 are still in the posses-ion of the GovernÂ­
ment.
The pendency of the proposition for unity of acÂ­
tion between the United States and the principal
commercial nations of Europe, to effect a permanent
system for the equality of go d and silver in the recÂ­
ogniz d money of the world, leads me to recommend
that Congress refrain from new legislation on the
general subject. The great revival of trade, interÂ­
nal and foreign, will supp:y, during the coming year,
its own instructions, which may well be awaited beÂ­
fore attempting further experiAlentgl measures with
the coinage. I would, however, srongly urge upon
Congress the importance of authorizing the SecreÂ­
tary of the Treasury to suspend the coinage of silver
dollars upon the present legal ratiO, Te iiarket
value of the silver lolltr being urformly and largeÂ­
ly less lhiti the: iarket value of the gold dollar, it is
obviously imprac icable to maintain them at par with
each other if both are coined without limit. If the
cheaper coin is forced into circulation it will. if
coined without limit, soon become the sole standard
cf value, and thus defeat the desired object, hilch is
a currency of both gold and silver, which shall be of
equivalent value, collar for dollar, with the univerÂ­
sally recognized i~ione; of the world.
THE RETituaiEON FI'R.i Ci:CULJTIONt
'of tUnited States not-s, with the capacity of legalÂ­
tender in private contracts, is a step to be taken in
our p:ogress towards a safe and stab'e cut rency,
which should be accepted as the policy and duty of
the Government, and the interest andi security of the
p-ople. It iG my firm c nviction that the issue of
legal-tender paper money based whollf upon the auÂ­
thority and cied t of the Government, except in exÂ­
treme emergency, is without warrant in the constiÂ­
tution, and a violation of sound financial principles.
The issue of United S ates notes during the late civil
war with the capacity of legal-tender between priÂ­
""ate individuals was not authorized except as a
means of lescuing the country from imminent peril.
The circulalion of thelse notes as paper money, for
any protracted period of time after the accomplishÂ­
ment of this purpose, was not contemplated by the
framers of the law under which they we, e issued.
They anticipated the redemption and withdrawal of
these notes at the earliest practicable period conÂ­
sistent with the attainment of the object for which
tlhey were provided.
'1 ne policy of the United States, steadily adhered
to from the adoption of the consti ution, has been to
avontl the creation of a National debt, and when,
from neces.sity in time of war, debts have beei
created, they have been paid off on the return cf
peace as rapdlly as possible. With this view, anti for
this purpose, it is recommenoed that the existing
laws for the accultulation of a sinking-fund suficient
t: extinguish the public debt within a linlited period
be mainta nedl. If any change of theobjects or rates
of taxation is deemed necessary by Congress, it is
suggestea that experience has shown that a duty can
be placed on tea and coffee, which will not enhance
the price of thise articles to the consume,. and
which wil add several millions o1 dollars annually to
the Treasury.


The continued deliberate violation by a large numÂ­
ber of the prominent and inlluential citizens of the
Territory of Utah of the laws of the United States
tor the prosecutioni and
PUNISHMIENT OF P'LYOAMY
demands the attention of every depattment of the
Government. This Territory has a population suffiÂ­
cient to entitle it to admission as a State, and the
general interests of the nation, as well as the welÂ­
fare of thacitizens of the t,-rritory, require its adÂ­
vance frotm the territorial form of government to the
resionmibiliiies and privileges of a State. This imÂ­
portant change will not, however, be approved by
the country while the citizens of Utah in very conÂ­
Sidierable number uphold a pract ce which is conÂ­
slemned as a c irie by the laws of all civilized comÂ­
mIunit es throughout the world.
'The liw or rtlle suppression of this offence was
enacted with great unanimity by Congress more
thaun seventeen years ago, but has remained until reÂ­
cently a dead lett' r in the Territory of Utah, because
of the peculiar diltlcuties attending its enforcoment.
Th, opinion widely prevailed among the citizens of
Utah that the law was in contravention of the conÂ­
stitutional guarantee of religious freedom. This ohÂ­
ject on is now removed. The Supreme Court of the
United States has decided the lw to he within the
legislative power of Co.rgre s, and binding as a ruse
of ac!ionl for all who reside within the Territories.
There is no longer any reason for delay or hesitaÂ­
tion in its enforcement. It should b!e limly and elÂ­
fectively executed. If not snftlciently stringent in
its provisions it should :e amended, and in aid of the
purpose in view, I recommend that more comrreÂ­
hensive and more searching methods for prevenltirg
as well as punishing this crime be provided. If
necess ry to secure obedience to the law, the enjoyÂ­
ment and exercise of the rights and privileges of
citizenship in the Territories of the iUnied States
may be withheld or withdrawn front those who vioÂ­
late or oppose the enforcement of the law on tils
subject
TIIE ELECTIONS OF THE PAST YEAR,
though occupied only with State offices, have not
fadled to elicit in the political discussions which atÂ­
tended Ihem all over the country, new and decisive
evidence of the deep interest which the g' eat body
of citizens take in the progress of the country toÂ­
wards a more general aslid complete establishment,
at whatever coat,. of universal security and freedom
in the exercise of the el ctive iranchise. While
many topics of political concern demand great atÂ­
tenti n from our peop e, both in the sphere of naÂ­
tional and state authority. I flnd no reason to qualify
the opinion 1 expressed tin my last annual message,
that no t(mporery or administrative interests of
government, however urgent or wneighty, will ever




 displace the zeal of our people in deferce of the
primary rights of citizenship, and that the power of
public opiuion will override all political prejudices,
and all seclignal and state attachments, in demandÂ­
ing that all over our wide territory the name
and character of citizens of the United
States shall mean one and the same
thing, and carry with them unchallenged
security and respect. I earnestly appeal to the intelÂ­
ligence and patrioism of all good citizens of every
part of the country, however much they may be diÂ­
vided in opinions on other political subjects, to unite
in compelling obed'ent e to existing laws a med at
the protection of the right of suffrage. I respectfully
urge upon Congress to supply any defects in these
laws which experience has shown and which it Is
within its power to remedy. I again invoke the coÂ­
operation of the executive and legislative authorities
of the States in this great purpose. I am fully conÂ­
vinced that if the public u ind can be set at rest on
this paramount question of popular rights;no serious
obstacle will thwart or delay the complete pacificaÂ­
tion of the country, or retard the general diffusion of
prosperity.
In a former message T invited the attention of conÂ­
gress to the subject of the
REFORMATION OF THE CIVIL SERVICE
of the Government, and expressed the Intenti-n of
tr ansmitting to Congress as early as practicable .a
report upon this subject by the chairman of the
civil-service commission.
In view of the facts that, during a considerable
period, the Government of Great Britain has been
dealing with administrative problems and abuses, in
various particulars analogous to those presented in
this country, and tnat In recent years the measures
adopted were understood to have been effective and
in every respect highly satisfac!ory. I thought it deÂ­
sirable to have fuller information upon the subject,
and accordingly requested the chairman of the civilÂ­
service conmmission to make a thorough investigation
for this purpose. The result has been an elaborate
and comprehensive report.
The report sets forth the history of the partisanÂ­
spoils syst.m in Great Britain. and of the rise and
fall of the parliamentary patronage, and of ofilcial
interference with the freedom of elections. It shows
that after long trials of various kinds of examinaÂ­
tions, those which are competitive and open on equal
.terms to all, and which are carried on under the
superintendence of a single commission, have, with
great advantage, been established as conditions of
admission to almost every official plade in the suborÂ­
dinate administration of that country and of British
India. The ccmpietion of the report, owing to the
extent of the labor involv,ed in its preparation, and
the omission of Congress to make any provision
either for the compensation or the expenses of the
commission, has been postponed until toe present
time. It is herewith transmitted to Congress.
While the reform measures of another Government
are of no authority for us, they are entitled to inÂ­
fluence, to the extent to which their intrinsic wisÂ­
dom. and their adaptation to our institutions and
social life may commend them to out consideration.
The views I have heretofore expressed concernÂ­
ing the defects ai d abuses in
OUR CIVIL ADMINISTRATION
remain unchanged, except in so far as an enlarged
experiincd las deepent d my sense of the duty both
of officers , nd of the people themselves to co-operÂ­
ate fir their removal. The grave evils and perils of
a partisan-spoils system of appointment to offtice and
of office tenure, are now generally recognized. In
the resolutions of the great parties, in the reports of
departmen's, in the debates end proceedings of ConÂ­
gress. in the messages of exe.cutives, the gravity of
these evils has been pointed out and the neeu of
their reform has been admitted.
To command the necessary support, every measure
of reform must be based on c mmon right and jusÂ­
tice, and must be compatible with the healthy existÂ­
ence of great p-rties, which are inevitable and esÂ­
sential in a free state.
When the people have approved a policy at a naÂ­
tional election, confidence on the part of the otfic-ers
they have selected, and of the advisers who, in acÂ­
corldaece with our pol tical instaitutions, should b-s
consulted, in the policy which it is their duty to carry
into effect, is indispensable. It is t minent y proper
that they should explain it before the people, as well
as illustrate its spirit in the performance of their ofÂ­
ficial duties.
Very different considerations apply to the greaterÂ­
number of those who fill the suborlinate places in
the civil service. Their tespon, ibility is to their suÂ­
periors in official Ioai ion. It is their duty to obey
the legal instructions of those upon whom that auÂ­
thority is devolved, and their best public service
consists in the discharge of their funct ons irrtspectÂ­
ive of parti-an politics. Their duties are the same,
whatever party is in power and whatever policy ireÂ­
vais. As a consequenc-, it follows that their ter ure
of office should not depend on the prevalence of any
col cy or the supremacy of any party, but should be
determined by their capacity to serve the people
most usefully, quite irrespective of partisan interÂ­
ests. The same considerations that should govern
the tenure, should also prevail in the appointment,
discipline, and removal of these sul-ordina es. The
au hority of appointn:en and removal is not a perÂ­
quisite, which may be used to aid a friend or reward
a partisan. but is a trust to be exercised in the pubÂ­
lie intert st, undtr all the sanctions which attend the
obligation to apply the publ:c funds only for public
purpos s.
Every citizen has an equal right to the honor and
profit of entering the public service of his country.
The only just g.ound or discrininatio.n, is the miieasÂ­
ure of character and capacity he nas to make that
service most useful to the people. Except in cases
where, upon just and recognized principles, as upon
the theory of pensions, ollices anti promotions
are bestowed as rewards for past services, thenr beÂ­
stowal upon any theory which disregards personal
merit, is an act of injurtice to the citizen, as well as
a breach of that trust subject to which the appointÂ­
ing power is held.
n the -""ht. of these principles, It becomes of great
lm9ortance to
PROVIlE JUST AND ADEQUATE a sANS,
especial', for every department, and large admiuisÂ­
trttive office. where personal discrimination on the
part of its head is not pr.rticable, for ascertaining
those qualiftiations to which appointments and reÂ­
movals should have reference. To fuil to provide
such mnÂ­ ans if not only to deny the opp rtunity of as.
certaining the facts upon \vWh ch the most rihtteous
claim to office depends, bitl, of necessity, to discou.Â­
age all worthy aspirants, by handing over appointÂ­
ments and removals, to nmere influence and favoi itÂ­
ism. if it is the right of the worthie t claimant to
gain the appointment, and the interest of the people
to bestow it upon him, it would seem clear that a
wise andt ju""t method of ascertain ng pers hal llÂ­
ness bor oltice must be an important ant permnanent
function of every just and wise government, t has
long since become hmiossuij, in !!~ great oicees,
for those having the duty of ilHoliiiiialtion and apÂ­
pointment, to personally exrmine into the;nuivl utis
qualilfications of more than a small porportion of
those seekling offitce;: and, with the en.argemnent of
the civil service, that proportion must continue to
become less.
In the earlier years of the Government, tlre suiiorÂ­
dinate offices were so few in ulmnber that it Was quite
easy for those making appointments and promotions
to personally ascertain the merits of candidates.


Party m-nagers and methods had nf.t then become
powerful agencies of coercion, hostile to the free and
just exercise of the appo uting power.
A large and responsible part of the duty of restorÂ­
ing the civil service to the desired purity and etliÂ­
ciency rests upon the President, and is is my purÂ­
pose to do what Is within my power to advance such
prudent and gradual measures of reform as will mott
surely and rapidly bring about that radical change of
system essential to make our administrative methÂ­
ods satisfactory to a free and intelligent people. By
a proper exerc:se of aurth ri:y, it is in tile power of
the Executive to do much to promote suchl a reform.
But it cannot be too cieas ly unud rstood that nothing
adequate can be accomplished without co-ope a ion
on time part of Con. liss and consider ate and intelliÂ­
gent support among the peop.e. Reforms which
challenge ihe generally accepted theories of par ties,
and demand hnanges in the methods of departments,
are not the worK of a clay. Their permanent foundaÂ­
tions must be laid in so.nd principles, and in an exÂ­
perlence which demlonstrates their wisdoum and exÂ­
poses t. e errors of their adversaries. Every wuithy
officer desires to make his official action a gain and
an honor to his country, but the people themselves,
far more nan their otlicers in puolic station, are i,,Â­
terei'ted in a pure, economical, and vigorous adminnÂ­
istration.
By laws enacted in 1853 and 1S35, and now in subÂ­
stance incorporated in the revised statutes,
THE PRACTICE OF ARBITRARY APPOINT ENTS
to the several subordinate grades in the great deÂ­
partments was condemned, and examina ions. as to
capacity, to be conducted by departmeutal boards of
examiners, were provided for and mae condiltons
of admission to the public service. These statutes
are a decision by Congre a that examinations of
some sort, as to attaimenuts and capacity, are esÂ­
sent al to the well-being of the public service. The
irrportant quest,ons since the enactment of these
laws have been as to the ch racter of these examl
nations, and whether official tfvcr and partisan inÂ­
1luence, or common right ai.d merit, were to counlol
the access to toe examinations In practice, thllse
examinations have not always been open to worthy
persous genera ly, who might wish be be examined.
Otficial favor.tisml and partisan influence, as a rule,
appear to have designated those who alone were perÂ­
mitted to go before the examining boards, subjretÂ­
ing even the examiners to a pressure from the
friends of the candidales very difficult to resist. As
a consequence, the standard of admise ion fell below
that which the public inte est demanded. It was
also almost inevitable that a system which I roveded
for varidbs separate boards of examiners, with no
common supervision or uniform method of proÂ­
cedure, should result in confusion, inconsistency.
andt inadequate tests of capacity highly detrimental
to the public interests. A further and more ratdical
change was obviously required.
I', the annual message of December. 1870, my preÂ­
decessor declared that ""there is no duty which so
much embarrasses the Executive and heads of deÂ­
partments as that of appointments; nor is there any
such ai duous and th ukless labor imposed on SenaÂ­
tors and Reoresentatives as that of lindinu places for
constituents. Tile present system ones not secure
the best men, and o ten not even fit men for the pubÂ­
lic places. The elevation and purification of the civil
service of the Government will be hailed with apÂ­
proval by the whole people of the United States.""
Congress accordingly pa sed the act, approved
March 3, 1871, ""to regulate the civil service of the
United 'tates and promote the efficiency thereof,""
giving the necessary authori y to the Executive to
inaugurate a civil-service reform.
Acting under this statute, which was interpreted
as Intendeds to secure a system of just and effectual
examinations under uniform supervision, a numt er
of eninently competent persons were selected for
the 1-urpose who entered wi h zeal upon the di,Â­
charge ol their duties, prepared, with an iutel igent
-;pprtci,.tioo of the requireluets of the scivice, the

 regulations contemplated, and took charge c: the exÂ­
aminations, and who, in their ca;acity as a board.
have been known as the ""Civil-Service Commission.""
Congress for two years appropriated the money
needed for the compensation and for the expense of
carrying on the work sf the Commission.
It appears from the report of the commission, subÂ­
mitted to the President in April, 1S74, that examinaÂ­
tions had been held in various sections of the counÂ­
try, and that an appropriation of about $25,000 would
be required to meet the annual exi)enses. including
salaries, involved in discharging the duties of the
commission. The report was transmitted to Congress
by special message of April 18, 1874, with the followÂ­
ing favorable comment upon the labors of the comÂ­
mission: ""If sustained by Congress, I have no doubt
the rules can, after the experience gained. be so ilmÂ­
proved and enforced as to still more materially beneÂ­
lit the publ.c service and relieve the Executive,
Mlembers of Congress, and the heads of Departments,
from influences prejudicial to good administration.
The rules, as they have hltherto been enforced, heve
resulted beneficially, as is shown by the opinions of
the members of the cabinet and their subordinates in
the departments, and in that opinion I concur."" And
in the annual message of December of the same sear
similar views are expressed, and an appropriat;on
for continuing the work of the cummission again adÂ­
vised.
TIHE APPROPRIATION WAS NOT WADE,
and, as a consequence, the active work of the ComÂ­
mission was suspended, leaving the Commission itÂ­
self still in existence. Without the means. thereÂ­
fore, of causing qualifications to be tested in any sysÂ­
tematic manner, or or securing for the public service
the advantages of competlli n upon any extensive
plan. I recommended in my annual message of DeÂ­
cember, 1877, the making of any approoriation for
thei resumption of thd'work of the Commission.
In the meantime, however, competitive examinaÂ­
tions under mang enmbarrassinents have been
conducted within limited spheres in the Executive
Departmet ts in Washin, ton, and in a number of the
custom houses and postoirices of the principal cities of
the country, with a view to further test their effects,
and, in every instance, they have been found to be
as salutary as they are staled to have been under
the administrat on of my predecessor. I think the
economy, purity, and efficiency of the public s-rvice
wou:d be greatly promoted by their systeumatic introÂ­
tiuction, wherever practicable, throughout, the entire
civil service of the Governmenut, together with anmÂ­
pie provision for their general supervision, in order
to secure consistency and uniform justice.
hi eports from the Secretary of the Interior, from the
Postinaster-leneral, from the po.tmaster in the city
of New York, where such examination have been
sometime on trial. and also from the collector of the
port, the naval ollicer, and the surveyor in that city,
and from the postmuisters anti collectors in seve at
other large cities show that the competitive system,
where applied, has, in various ways, contributed to
improve the public service.
The reports show that the results have been sa uÂ­
tary in a marked degree, and that the general applilÂ­
calion of similar ru.es, cannot fail to be of deciled
benefit to tile service.
The reports of-the Government otlfters, in the city
of New 1ork espec ally, bear decided testimony to
the utility of opt n competitive examinatious in their
respective oftlncs, showing that ""these examina
tions, and the excellent qualifications of those adÂ­
mitted to the service through them, have had a
marked incidental effect upon persons previou, ly in
the service, ann particularly u. on those aspiring to
promotion. There has has been on the part of these
latter, an increased interest in the work, and a desire
to extend acquaintance with it beyond the particular
desk occupied, and thus thie mrorale of the entire
force has been raised. 'r
"" The examinations
have been attended by many ci'izens who have had
an opportunity to thoroughly investigate the scope
and character of the tests and melhon of determinÂ­
ing the results, and those visitors have, without exÂ­
ception, approved tile methods elnployed and severÂ­
al of them h;ve publicly attested their favorable
opinion.""
Upon such considerations, I dteemn it tmy duty to
renew the recommtlendation contained in my annual
message of December, 1677, requesting Congress to
make the necs-saly approprilion for the resunipÂ­
tiIn of the work of tile civil herv-ce colimlssion.
Economy will be promoted by authorizing a InoderÂ­
ate compensation tot ersons in the public service
who may perfo:m extra labor upon or under the
commission, as the Executive may direct.
I am convinced that if a just and adequate test of
merit is cubioc 0 for adI(lission to the putic service
antl in luakiIng promotlous, such altuses as removals
without good cause aind partisan and official interÂ­
ference with the proper exercise or the appointing
power, will in large Imeasure disappear.
TIIERE ARE OTHER ADMINISTIR TIVE ABUSES
to which tire attention of Congress shoul I be aske:l
in this connection. Mlere partisan appointments, and
tihe constant fear of rem't;val without cause, very nat .
urally lead to an absot bing and mischievous political
activity, on the part of those thus appointed, whicr
not only interfe, t s with the due discharge of official
duty, but is ltcomnpatible with tile freedoni of elecÂ­
tions. Not without warrant, in the views of several
or my predecessors in the I'residentlal offlce, and diÂ­
r ctly within the law of 8s71, alreaay cited, IntleavÂ­
ored, by regulation, made on tile odtl d.iy of June.
1h77, to put soime reasonable limiits to eluch abuses.
It may not be easy, and it may never perhips be necÂ­
essary, to de!ine with precision the proper limit of
political action on tile part of federal officers. But
while their right to hold anti freely express their
opinions cannot be question, d, it is very pia n that
they should neither be allowed to devo'e to other
subjects the time needed for the proper diecharge of
their official duties, nor to use the authoriny of their
office to enforce thl ir own opinions, or to coerce the
political action of those who holl differe,.t opinions.
Reasons of justice and public policy, quite analoÂ­
gous to those which forbid the use of official power
for the oppression of the private citizen, impoe
upon the Goverrnment the duty of protecting i as oilÂ­
ceis and agents from arbitrary exactions. In whatÂ­
ever aspect considered, tile practice of making levies,
f.:r party purposes, upon the salaries if officers is
highly demorahz:ng to the public service rind disÂ­
creditablle to the country. Though an officer should
be as flee as any Othler citizen to give h's own lioney
in aid of his oplnions or his patty, lie should also be
as free as any other citizen to refuse to make such
gifts. It salaries are but a fair compensation fLr the
time anti labor of tee otficer, it is a gross injustice to
levy a tax upon them. If they are made excess,ve
int order that they may bear thltax, the excess is an
indtlirect robbety of the public fdnls.
1 rectmmlent!, therefore, such a revision and exÂ­
tension of presenlt statutes as shall secure to those
in every grade of othicial life or plub ic emlployment
the protection witll whlicll a great anti enlghtenedt
Nation should guard those whlo are faitllful in its serÂ­
vice.

The assent of the Government has been given to
the landing, on the coast of Massachusetts, of a new
and independent transatlantic cable between France,
by way of the FrenI h island of St. Pierre, and this
country, subject to any future legislation of Congress
on the subje t. The conditions imposed, bIfore alÂ­
lowing this connection with our shores to be estabÂ­
lished, are such as to secure its competition with any
existing or future lines of mIarine cable, and preÂ­
clnde arna-gamati,in therewith. to provide for entire
equality of rights to our Government and people
wtll those of France in the use of ihe cable, and
preveut any exclusive niossession of the privilege as
accorded by France to the disadvantage of any fuÂ­
ture cable communication between France and the
United States which may be projected and accomÂ­
p ished by our citizens. An important reduc ion of
the present rates of cable communication with EiÂ­
rope, felt to be too burdensome to the interests of
our commerce, must necessarily flow front the esÂ­
tab ishment of this competing line.
The attention of Congress was drawn to the proÂ­
priety of some general regulation by Longress of the
whole subject of transmarine cables by my predeÂ­
cessor in his message of Dec. 7, 1875, and I respectÂ­

The questions of grave importance with Spain,
growih g out of the incidents of the Cuban insurrecÂ­

that the Commission now sitting in Washington. for
the decision of private cases in this connection, will

The long-standing question of East Florida claims

for its tlfinal disposition.
A treaty wnth the Netherlands. with respect to conÂ­

Some questions with Switzerland, in regard to
pauper aund convict emigrnllrs, have arisen, but it is
not doubted ,hat they will be arranged upon a just

with respect to an a-serted claim by Swiss muri.dÂ­

With the German Empire frequent questions arise
in connection with the subjects of naturalization and

comply with all tieaty stipulations in regard to them.
In consequence of the omission of Congress to proÂ­

one, in Fome form, is submitted to congress.
Relations with Austria, Russia, Italy, Portugal,
Turkey, and Belgium continue amicable, and marked

commercial treaties, it is now believed will be folÂ­

powers. The attention of Congress is again invited
to the subject of the indemnity funds reclived some
years since, from Japan and China, which, wi' h their
accumulated interest, now amount to considerabe
sums. If any part of these funds is justly due to
American citizens they should receive it promptly;
and whatever may have been received.by this GovÂ­
ernment in excess of stric ly just demands, should
in some form be returned to the natiois to whom it
equitably belongs.
The uovernmntof China has niguitied its willingÂ­

subjects to the United States with a dispassionate
fairness, and to co-operate in such measures as may
tend to pr, vent injurious consequences to the United
States. The negotiations are still proceeding, and
will be pressed with dil'gence.
A question havingarisen between China and Japan

It is a gratification to be able to announce that,
through the judicious and energetic action of the
milltaly commanders of the two nations on each side
of the hio Grande, under the instructions of their
,espective Governments, raids and depreitatons
have greatly decreased, and, in the localities where
formerly most destructive, have now almost wholly
cented. In view of this result, I entertain a confident
expec.ation that the prevalence of quiet on the
border will soon become to alsured as to ju-tify a
modification of the present orders to our military
command: rs as to cro-sing the border, without enÂ­

Diplomatic intercourse with eolombia is again

AN INTEIR-OCEANIC CANAL
has recently assumed a new and important aspect,
and is now under discussion with the Central AmerÂ­
ican countries through whose territory the canal, by
the Nicaragua route, would have to pass. It is
trusted that enlightened statesmanship on their part
will see that the early prosecution of such a work
will largely enure to the penefit, not only of their own
cit.zens and those of the United States, but of the
cohielirce of thie civilize I wor d. It is riot doubted
that s!lould the work be undertaken under the proÂ­
tective auspices of the Cnited States. and upon satisÂ­
factory concessi',ns for tile right of way, and its seÂ­
curity, by the Central American governn-ntls. the

such guarantees, prove inaccessib.e.
Dipl'llatic relations with Chili have also been

FINANCE.
The attention of Congress is called to the annual
report of the Secretary of the Treasury on the conÂ­
dition of the public finances.
The ordinary revenues from all sources for the fisÂ­
cal yeartended June 30, 1Sl9, were $273,S2, 184 46: the
ordinary expenditures fori hlle same period were $226,
94,8663.53; leaving a surplus revenue for the year of
$6.879,3010.93.
The receipts for the present fiscal year, ending
Jutne 30. 1880, actual and esrimated, are as follows:
Actual receipts for the first quarter commencing
July i. 1879, $79,843,663.61; estimatedi receipts for the
remainlnr three-quarters of the year, $20(,156.336.39;
total receipts for the current fiscal year, actual and
estimated, $288,000,000.
The expenditures for the same periol will be,
actual and estimated, as follows: For the quarter
commencing July 1, 1879. actual expenditures, $91,Â­
683,385.10; and for the remaining three-quarters of
the year the expenditures are estimated at $1;2,316,Â­
614.90-making the total expenditures $264,000.000,
and leaving an estimated surplus revenue for the
year endkig June 30, 1988, of $24 000,000. The total
receipts during the next liscul year ending June 30,
1SSI, estimated according to existing laws, will be
$2S e000,000; and the estimated oruiuary expendiÂ­
tures for the sam., period will be $27S.097,S64.39Â­
leaving a surplupof $3,9 2,635.61 for that year.
The large amount expended for arrears of penÂ­
sions during the last andl the present tiscal year,
amounting to $21,747,249.60 has prevented the appliÂ­
cation of the full amout.t required by'law to the
sinking-fund for the current year: but these arrears
have been substantially paid, it is believed that the
sinking-fund cani hereafter be maintained without
any change of existing law.
THE SECRETARY OF WAR
reports that the War-Department estimates for the
fiscal year ending June 30,x'881, are $40.3S0,428.xr3.
the same being for a less sum of money than any anÂ­
nual estirhate rendered to Congress from that DeÂ­
partment during a period of at least twelve years.
Ile concurs with the General of the Army lureÂ­
commending ouch legislation as will authorize the
enlistmentof the full number of twenty-five thouÂ­
sand men for the line of the Army. exclusive of the
three thousand four hundred add sixty-three men reÂ­
quired for detached duly, and therefore not availÂ­
able for service in the field.
He also recommends tlhat Congress be asked to
provide by law for the disposition of a large number
of abandoned military p ,sts and reservations, weich,
though very valuable in themselves, have been renÂ­
dered useless for military purposes bj the advance
of civilization and settlement.
He unites with the Quartermaster-General in recÂ­
ommending that an appropriation be made for the
coan truction of a cheap and perfectly fire-proof

 building for the safe storage of a vast amount of
money accounts, vouchers, c'aims, and other valuaÂ­
ble records now In the Quartermaster-General's
otice, and exposed to great risk of total destruction
by lire.
He also recommends, in conformity with the views
of the Judge-Advocate General, some declaratory
legislttion in reference to the military statute of limÂ­
itations as applied to the crime of desertion
In these several recommeudations I concur.
The Secretary of War further reports, that the
work for the improvement of the South Pass of the
Missis-ippi River, under contract with Mr. James B.
Eads, Irade in pursuance of an act of Congress, has
been prosecuted during the past year, with a greater
measure of success In the attainment ,.f results than
during any previous year. The channel.through the
South Pass, which, at the beginning of operations in
June, 1875, had a depth of only seven and one-half
feet of water, had, on the Sth of July, 1879, a miniÂ­
mum depth of twenty-six feet, having a width of
not less than two hundred feet and a central depth
of thirty feet. Payments have been made in accordÂ­
ance with the statute, as the work progressed,
amounting in the aggregate to $4,250,000; and further
paymerits will iecome due, as provided by the statÂ­
ute, in the event of success in maintaining the chanÂ­
nel now secured.
THE REPORTS OF THE GENERAL OF THE ARMY
and of his subordinates, presen, a full and detailed
account of the military operations for the suppression
of host,lities among the Indians of the Ute and
Apache tribes, and praise is justly awarded to the
odlicers and troops engaged, for prompitess, skiIl,
and courage displayed.
't'he past year has been one of almost unbroken
peace and quiet on the Mexican frontier, and there
is reason to believe that the efforts of this GovernÂ­
ment and of Mexico, to i aintain order in that reÂ­
gion, will prove permanently successful.
This department was enabled during the year to
find temporary though crowded accomodation, and a
safe del.os tory for a portion of its records, in the
completed exst wing of the building, designed for
the state, A ar, and Navy Departments. The con.
struction of the north wing of tire building, a part of
the structure intended for the use of the War DeÂ­
partment,,is being carried forward with all possible
dispatch, and the work should receive from Congress
such liberal appropriation as will secure its speedy
completion.
THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF TIIE NAVY
shows continued improvements in that branch of
the ser6 ice during the last fiscal year. .Extensive reÂ­
pairs have been made upon vessels, and two new
ships have been compleled and made ready for use.
'1 lie total expenditures of the year ended June 30,
1879 ilicludinog specific appropriations not estimat-d
for by the Depaltment, were $:3,555,710.09. The exÂ­
penses chargeable to the year, aft -r deducting the
amounl, of these speciufic appropriations, were $13,Â­
343,317.79; but this is subject to a reduction of $%S3,Â­
725.99, that amount having been drawn upon warÂ­
rants, but not paid out during the year. The amount
of applopriations applicable to the last fiscal year
was $14,538,646.17. 'There was, therelore, a balance
of $1,479,054 37 remaining unexpended, and to the
credit of the department, on .June 30, 1819. The estiÂ­
mates for the fiscal year ending June 3v, 1881, are
$1i4.864,1447.95, which exceeds. the appropriations for
the present fiscal year $361.897.28. The reason for
this increase is explained in the Secretary'b report.
The approprialions available for the present nscal
year are $14 502,250.67, which will, in the opinion of
the Secretary, answer all the ordinary demands of
the service. The amount drawn from the Treasury
from July
I to November 1, 1879, was $5,770,4-4.12, of
which $1,095,440.833 has been refunded. leaving as the
expenditure for that period $4,674,963 79. If toe exÂ­
penditures of the remaining two-thirds of the year
do not exceed the proportion for these four mouths,
there will remain unexpended, at the end of the
year, $477,359.30 of the Current appropriations. The
report of the Secretaty shllows thle gratilyiug tact that
among all the disbursing ollicers of the par corps of
the navy.there is not one who is a defaulter to the
eatent of a single dollar. I unite with hinm in recomÂ­
mending the removal of the observatory to a mlore
healthful location. That institution reflects credit
upon the nation, and has obtained the approbation
of icientlic mnen in all paris of the world. Its reÂ­
moval from its present location would not only be
conducive to the health of its officers and professors,
but would greatly increase its usefulness.
TIHE AIPPROPRIATION FOR JUDICIAL EXPENSES,
which hai heretofore been made fortile Department
-of Justice, in gloss, was Subdivide.J at the last sesÂ­
sion o, Congress, and no appropriation whstever was
made for tile payment of the lees of marshals and
tlleir deputies, either In the service of process or for
the dllscnargi, of othler duties, and, since June 30,
these officers have continued the performance of
their duties, without compensation from the GovernÂ­
ient, talking upon thellcnmselves the necessary inciÂ­
dental outlays, as well as rendering their own serÂ­
vices In only a few unavoidable instances, has the
proper execution tf the process of the United States
iailed by leason of the absence of.the requi-i ie apÂ­
propriatiou. This course of ollciall conduct on the
part of these officers, highly creditable to their
lidelity, was advised by th : Attorney-General, who
iniformned themi, hlowever, tllat they would necessaÂ­
rily have to rely for their compensation upon the
prospect of future legislation by Congress I thereÂ­
fore especially recomllend that immediate appropriÂ­
ation re made by C ogress for this purpose.
Tie act nmaking the principal appropriation for the
Department of Justice at, previous sessions has uniÂ­
formly contained the foll,.wing clause: ""And for
uefraying the expenses which may be incurred in
the enforcement of the act approved February 28,
1870, entitled, *An act to amend an act approved May
30, 1870, entitled 'An act to enforce the right of citiÂ­ 1
zens of the United St.tes to vote in the several 1
States of the United States, and for other purposes,'
or any ac S amendatory thereof or supplementary
the eto.""
No appropristion was n ade for this purpose for
the current year. As no geal ral election for memÂ­
hers of Congress occurred, the omission was a matÂ­
ter of little practical Importance. Such election I
will, however, take place during the ensuing year,
and the appropriation made for thi pay of m rshals
and deputies should be suffilcient to embrace comÂ­
pensation for the services they may be required to
perform at such elections.
The busines of the Supreme Court is, a' present,
largely in arrears. It cannot be expected that more
causes can be decided than are now disposed of in
its annual ""session, or that by any assiduity the disÂ­
tinguished nmagist' ates who compose the court can
accomplish more than is nhow dose. In the c urts of
many .f the circuits, also,the ibuiness has increased
to such an extel t, that thile delay of justice will call
the attention of Congress tfi an appropriate remedy.
It is believed that all is done in each ci cult which
can fairy be expected from its judicial force. The
evils arising from dlelay, are less-heavily felt by the
United Siates, than by private suitors, as its causes
are advanced by ths courts when it is seen that they
involve the discussion of questio.s of a pubilic charÂ­
acter. r
Thile remedy suggested by the Attorney-General, is '
the appointment of additional circuit judges, and the
creation of an intermediate court of errors and apÂ­
i
peals. which shall relieve the Supreme Court of a
part of its jurisdiction, while a larger forca is also t
obtained for the nerformance of circlit dntred I


I commend this sugger tion to the consideration of
Congress. It would seem to afford a complete remÂ­ i
edy, and would involve, if ten additional circuit
judges are appointed an expenditure, at the present
rate of salaries, of not more than sixty thousand dolÂ­
lars a year. which wou;d certainly be small in comÂ­
parison with the objects to be atta'ned.
THEL IREPORT OF THE POSTMIA TER-GENERAL
bears testimony to the genera. revival of business
throughout the country. The receipts of the Post
Office Departmentfor the fiscal year ended June 30,
1879, were $30,041,98'.56, being $764.465.91 mrore than
the revenues of the preceding year. The amount
realized from the sale of postage-stain ps, stamped enÂ­
velopes, and postal cards, was $764,465.91 more than
in the preceding year, and $2,3x7,559.23 more than in
1S7T. The expenditures of the dep rtment were
$33,449,599 45, of which the sum of $376.461.63 was
paid on liabilities incurred in
, receding years.
The expenditures during the year were $S01,209.77
less than in the preceding year. Tkhs reduction is
to be attributed mainly to the operation of the law
passed June 7, 1878, changing the compensation of
postmas ers front a coninlissio0, on the value of
stamps sold, to a commission on stamps cancelled.
The amount drawn from the Treasury on approÂ­
priations in addition to tle levenues of the departÂ­
ment was $3,031,454 90, being $S,276,197.86 less than
in the preceding year.
The expenditures for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1P81. ar, estimated at $39.920,9u0, and the receipts
from all sources at $32,2o,0,0u, leaving a deficiency
to be appropriated for, out of the Treasury, of
$7,710,900.
The relations of the department: with railroad
companies have been harmonized, ifotwithstanding
tihe general reduction by Congress of their compenÂ­
sation, by the appropriation of special facilities, and
the railway post-dfilce lines have been greatly exÂ­
tended, especially in the Southern States. The InÂ­
terests of the railway-mail service and of the public
would be preatly promoted, and the expenditures
could be Tmore readily controlled by the classification

New York Sun.
During a oold spring, like that
which is just now drawing to an end,
people generally console themselves
with tho reflection that the sun will
eventually get the victory, and that
summer will come at last, thouch ita
coming may be delayed. Uncertain as
the weather is, the general teatures ot
the season reour with a regularity
which warrants the confidence thus
reposed in the annual return of seed
time and harvest; but there are ins
stances on record in which even the
seasons seem to have lost their char
acteristic features, as if the ordinary
laws ot meteorology bad been temporaÂ­
rily suspended. A remarkable
case of this kind, and one which the
long continued oold weather of this
spring makes particularly interesting
just now, is that ot the year 1816,
wbion bas been called the year wi'h
out a summer. A communication
printed in the Congregationalist gives
the following summary ot the weather
or this remarkable year:
January and February were mild
March was cold: April beran warm
but ended in snow and ice. ioe formed

planted over and over again till it was
too late to replant. June was the
coldest ever known in this latitude;

season. But little rain fell. Tho
wind blew steadily from tho north.coM
and fieroe. Mothers knit extra socks
and mittens for their children in the
spring, and wood piles, that usually
disappeared during the warm spell, in
front of the houses were speedily built
up again. Planting and shivering
were done together, and the farmers
who worked out their taxes on the
country roads wore overcoats and mitÂ­
tens. In a town in Vermont a flock
of sheep belonging to a farmer had
been sent as usual to the pasture. On

at night to ward of the frost. Many

As the above disease has cansed
- the death of several children hereÂ­

1 concerning the same has been inÂ­
- dulged in, regarding its cure, treatÂ­
r ment, etc., we publish the following
in reference thereto, taken from a
late Vicksburg paper:
Ruth Lockwood, a 9. year old
child, became violently ill with dipÂ­
theria a little while ago in WashÂ­
ington, D. C. She was so weak
that it was deemed dangerous to
try trachcotomy, or cutting open
. the windpipe. A day or two be
fore the doctor was called he reÂ­
ceived a copy of the ParisFigaro,
which contained a report made to
the French.Academy of Medicine
by Dr. Delthi. Dr. Delthi said
that the vapors of liquid tar and
' terpentine would dissolve the fibriÂ­
nouns exudations which choak up
t the throat in croup and diptheria.
Dr. Delthil's process was prescribed.
He pours equal parts of terpentine
, and a liquid tar into a tin pan or
cup, and sets fire to the mixture.
A dense, resinous smoke arises,
which obscures the air of the room.
""The patient"" Dr. Delthil says,
""immediately seems to experience
relief; the choking and rattle stop;
the patient falls into a deep slumÂ­
s her and 'seems to inhale the smoke
, with pleasure. The. fibrinous memÂ­
brane soon becomes detached, and
the patient coughs up mircrohiciÂ­
* des. These, when caught in a
, glass, may be seen to dissolve in
. the smoke. In the course of three
days afterward the patient entirely
recovers.""
The doctor tried the experiment
successfully with little Ruth LockÂ­
wood. She was lying. gasping for
breath when he visited her. First
pouring aabont two tablespoonfuls
of liquid tar on an. iron pan, he
- poured as much turpentine over it,
and set it on fire. The rich, resiÂ­
nous smoke which rose to the ceilÂ­
ing was by no means unpleasant.
As it filled the room the child's
breathing became natural, and as
the smoke grew dense she fell
asleep.

TliE MEtORABLE FIELD OF CIIICItMAUGA,
a field which, however disastrous to the
Union arms, gave to him the occasion of
winning imperishable laurels. The very
rare distinction was accorded him of a
great promotion for his bravery on a field
that was lost. President Lincoln appointÂ­
f ed him a Major General in the army ofthe
United S ates ""for gallant and meritorious
.conduct in the battle of Chickamauga.""
The Army of the Cumberland was reorÂ­
ganized under the command of General
Thomas, who promptly offered Garfield
I
one of its divisions. He was very desir.
ous to accept the position, but was embarÂ­
rassed by the fact that he had a year before
been elected to Congress, and the time
when he must take his .seat was drawing
near. He preferred to remain in the miliÂ­
tary service, and had within his own
breast the largest confidence of success in
the wider field which his new rank openÂ­
ed to him. Balancing the arguments on
the one side and the other, anxious to deÂ­
termine what was for the best, desirous
above all things to do his patriotic duty,
he was decisively influenced by
f TIIE .ADVCE OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN
and Secretary Stanton, both of whom asÂ­
sured him that he could at that time be of
special value in the House of RepresentaÂ­
tives. He resigned his commission of MaÂ­
jor General on the 5th day of December,
18(3, and took his seat in the House of
RIepresentatives on the 7'ith. He had servÂ­
ed two years and four months in the army,
and just completed his 82d year.
TIIE THIRTY EIOnTiL CONGRESS
is entitled in history to the designation of
the War Congress. It was elected while
the war was flagrant, and every member
was chosen upon the issues involved in
Ithe continuance of the struggle. The
Thirty-seventh Congress had indeed legis.
lated to a large evtent on war measures;
but it was chosen before any one believed
that secession of the States would actually
be attempted. The magnitude ofthework
which fell upon its successor was unpre.
cedented both in respect to the vastsutn of
money raised for support of the army and
navy, and to the new and extraordinary
powers of legislation which it was forced
to exercise. Only twenty-four States were
represented, and 182 members were upon
its rolls. Among these were
MA.N DISTINGUISHtED PARTY LEADEIRS
on both sides-veterans in the public serÂ­
vice, with established reputations for abilÂ­
ity, and with that skill which comes odly
from parliamentary experience. Into this
assemblage of men Garfield entered, withÂ­
out special preparation, and, it might alÂ­
most be said, unexpectedly. The question
a of taking command of a division of
troops under General Thomas, or taking
his seat in Congress, was kept open till
the last moment-so late, indeed, that the
resignation of his military commission
and his appearance in the House were alÂ­
most cotemporaneous. He wore the uniÂ­
form of a Major General of the United
States army on Saturday, and on Monday
in civilian's dress he answered to the rollÂ­
call as a Representative in Congress from
the state of Ohio.

MOST IELPFUL AND MOST EXACTING OF

Their tenacious trust in men in whom

the unparalled fact that Elisha Whittlesey,

and, if he loses and falls back, he must
expect n' mercy, and will receive no symÂ­
pathy. It is a field in which the survival
of the strongest is the recognized rule,
and where no pretense can be derived and
no glamour can mislead. The real man is
discovered, his worth is impartially weighÂ­
ed, his rank is irrevocablydecided. With
possibly a single exception, Garfield was i
the youngest member in the House when i
lie entered, and was but seven years from 1
his college graduation; but he had not I
been in his seat sixty dlays before
IIIS ABILITY WAS RECOGNIZED t
and his place conceded. He. stepped to I
the front with the confidence of one who
belonged there; the House was crowded
with strong men of both parties; nineÂ­
teen of them have since been transferred
to the Senate, and many of them have c
served with distinction in the GubernatoÂ­
rial chairs of their respective states, and
on foreign missions of great consequence.
But among all, none grew so rapidly,
none so firmly, as Garfield. As is said by
Trevelyan of his parliamentary hero, GarÂ­ I
field succeeded because all the world in
concert could not have kept him in thei d
background, and because, when once in
the front, he played his part with aprompt t
intepidity and a commanding ease that 1]
were but the outward symptoms of t
THE IMM(ENSE RESERVES OF ENERGaY F
on which it was in his power to draw.
Indeed, the apparenrtl,Â­ reserved force
which Garfield possessed was one of his c
great characteristics. He never did so
well but that it seemed hlie could easily
have done better. Heneverspentsomuch a


strength but that he seemed to be holding I
additional power at call. This is one of a
the happiest and rarest distinctions of an r
effective leader, and often counts for as Je
much in persuading an assembly as elo.
quent and elaborate argument. e
HIS MILITARY LIFE, a
illustrated by honorable performance, and a
rich in promise, was, as he himself felt, a
prematurely terminated and necessarily P
incomplete. Speculation as to what he
might have done in a field where thegreat s'
prizes are so few cannot be profitable. It h
is sufficient to say that as a soldier he did
his duty bravely, he did it intelligently, h
he won an enviable fame, and he retired 11
from the service without blot or breath ""
against him. As a lawyer, though admir. 5a
ably equipped for the profession, he can
scarcely be said to have entered on its a
practice. n
THE FEW EFFORTS MADE AT THE BAR C
were distinguished by the same high orÂ­ I
der of talent which he exhibited on every d
field where he was put to the test, and, if
a man may be accepted as a competent e
judge of his own capacities and adaptaÂ­ tt
tions, the law was the profession to which
Garfield should have devoted himself. C
But fate ordained otherwise, and his repu-.
tation in history will rest largely upon his o
service in the House of Representatives. tI
That service was exceptionally long. He h
was nine times consecutive Congressman P
to the House, an honor enjoyed by not
more than six other Representatives of the
more than 1,000 who have been elected
from the organization of the government F
to this hour.
AS A PARLIAMEETARY ORATOR,
as a debater on an issue squarely joined, h
where the position had been chosen and a
the ground laid out, Garfield must be as. p
signed a very high rank-more perhaps o
than any man with whom he was associÂ­ d
ated in public life. He gave careful and e;
systematic study to public questions, and a
he came to every discussion in which he Ii
took part with elaborate and complete b

 preparations. He was a steady and indeÂ­
ffatigable worker. Those who imagine
that talent or genius can supply the place
a
or achieve the results of labor will find no
encouragement in Garield's life. In preÂ­
I
liminary work he was apt, rapid and skillÂ­
f ful. He possessed in high degree
THE POWER OF READILY ABSORBING IDEAS
and facts, and, like Dr. Johnson, had the
art of getting from a book all that was of
value in it by a reading apparently so
quick and cursory that it seemed like a
mere glance at the table of contents. He
was pre-eminently a fair and candid man;
I in debate he took no petty advantage,
stooped to no unworthy methods, avoided
personal allusion, rarely appealed to preÂ­
judice, did not seek to inflame passion.
He had a quicker eye for the strong point
of his adversary than for his eak point;
I
and on his own side he so marshaled his
w1
eighty arguments as to make his hearers
forget every possible lack in the complete
strength of his position. He had a habit
of stating his opponent's side with
SUCiH A3PLITUDE OF FAIRIESS,..
and such liberality of concession, that his
followers often complained that he was
giving his case away. But never in hIsis
prolonged participation inthe proceedings
in the House did he give his case away,
or fail, in the judgment of competent and
impartial listeners, to gain the mastery.
These characteristics which marked GarÂ­
field as a great debater did not, however,
make him a great parliamentary leader.
A parliamentary leader, as that term is unÂ­
derstood wherever free representative govÂ­
ernment exists, is necessarily and very
strictly the organ of his party. An ar.
dent American defined the instinctive
warmth of patriotism when he offered the
toast, ""Our country, always right, but,
right or wrong, our country.""
TIIE PAR.IA3aYtETARYLEADEn
who has a body of followers that will do
and dare and die for the cause, is one who
believed his party always right, but, right
or wrong, is for his party. No more im.
portant or exacting duty devolved upon
him than the selection of the field and the
time for contest. He must know not mereÂ­
ly how to strike, but where to strike and
when to strike. He often skillfullvavoids
the strength of his opponent's position
and scatters confusion in his ranks by atÂ­
tacking an exposed point, when really
TIIE RIOIITEOUStESSs OF THE CAUSE
and the strength of the logical intrench.
ment are against him. He conquers often
both against the right and the heavy batÂ­
talions, as when young Charles Fox, in
the days of his Toryism, carried the House
of Commons against justice, against im-.
memorial rights, against his own convic.
tionsÂ­ if, indeed, at that period Fox had
convictions, and in the interests of a corÂ­
rupt administration, in obedience to a ty.
-
rannical sovereign, drove Wilkes from the
seat to which the electors of Middlesex
had chosen him, and installed Luttrell, in
defiance not only of law but of public deÂ­
cency. For an achievement of that kind,
Garfield was disqualified-disqualified by
the texture of his mind, by
THE HONESTY OF HIS HEART,
by his conscience, and by every instinct
and aspiration of his nature. The three
most distinguished parliamentary leaders
hitherto developed in this country are Mr.
Clay, Mr. Douglas and Thaddeus Stevens.
Each was a man of consummate ability,
of great earnestness, of intense personality, I
differing widely eachTrom the others, and
yet with a signal trait in common-the
power to command. In the give and take
of daily discussion; in the art of controlÂ­
ling and consolidating reluctant and reÂ­
fractory followers; in the skill to overÂ­
come all forms of opposition and to meet
with competency and courage the varying
phases of unlooked-for assault or suspectÂ­
ed defection, it would be difficult to rank
with these a fourth name in all our ConÂ­
gressional history. But of these Mr. Clay
was the greatest. It would, perhaps, be I
impossible to find in
THE PARIAMENTAERY ANNhALS OF TIHE
WORLD .
a parallel to Mr. Clay in 1841, when at 064
years of age, he took the control of the
Whig party from the President who had
received their suffrages, against the power i
of Webster in the Cabinet, against the elÂ­
oquence of Choate in the Senate, against E
the herculean efforts of Caleb Cushing I
and Henry A. Wise in the House. In un.
shared leadership, in the pride and pleni. 1
tude of power, he hurled against John Ty. I
ler, with deepest scorn, the mass of that
conquering column which had swept over -
the land in 1840, and drove his adminisÂ­
tration to seek shelter behind the lines of C
his political foes. Mr. Douglas achieved e
a victory scarcely less wonderful when, in t
1854, against the secret desires of a strong L
administration, against the wise counsel
of the older chiefs, against the conserva.
tire instincts and even the moral sense of t
the country, he l

into a repeal of the Missouri compromise. I.
Mr. Thaddeus Stevens, in his contest from F
1865 to 1808, actually advanced his parliaÂ­ o
mentary leadership until Congress tied F
the hands of the President and governed
the country by its own will, leaving only C
perfunctory duties to be discharged by the P
Executive. With two hundred millions e
of patronage in his hands at the opening d
of the contest, aided by the active force of v
Seward in lthe Cabinet, and the moral powÂ­ t7
er of Chase on the bench, Andrew JohnÂ­
son could not command the support of ii
one-third in either house against the parÂ­
liamentary uprising of which Thaddeus I
Stevens was the animating spirit and the d
unquestioned leader. Fromn these three h

the breadth of his Congressional work he n
left that which will long exert a potential
influence among men, and which, measurÂ­
ed by the severe test of posthumous critiÂ­ i
cism, will secure a more enduring and
more enviable fame. Those familiar with h

may, in some degree, measure them by the n
annals of Congress. No one of the geneÂ­ 0
ration of public men to which he belongÂ­ 1
ed has contributed so much that will be tS
valuable for future reference. His speech. h
es are numerous, many of them brilliant, Ii
all of them well-studied, carefully-phrased P
and exhaustive of the subject under conÂ­ It
sideration. Collected from the scattered al
pages of ninety royal octavo volumes of b4

through which the National Government a

amendments to the constitution, mainteÂ­ n
nance of public credit, steps towards speÂ­ u

may be reviewed unsurrounded by prejuÂ­
dice and disconnected from partisanship
-the speeches of Garfield will be esteemÂ­ 01
ed at their true value, and will be found cc
to comprise a vast magazine of fact. and w
argument, of clear analysis and sound conÂ­ si
elusion. Indeed, if no other authority Ib
were accessible, his speeches in the House st
of Representatives from December, 1863, ti
to June, 1880, would gives well-connected S
history and complete defense of the imÂ­ a
portant legislation of the seventeen eventÂ­ to
ful years that constitute hi

Far beyond that, his speeches would be to
found to forecast many great measuresyet 01
to becompleted-measures which he knew at
were beyond the public opinion of the 1p
hour, but which he confidently believed tI
would secure popular approval within the tI
period of his own lifetime, and by the aid A
of his own efforts. Differing, as Garfield th
did, from the brilliant parliamentary lead. al
era, it is not easy to find his counterpart di

OAIIFIELD'S NOMINATION TO TIIE I'tESIÂ­
DENCY,
while not predicted or anticipated, was
e
not a surprise to the country. Hits promiÂ­
lnence in Congress, his solid'qualities, his
wide reputation, strengthened by his then
recent election as Senator from Ohio, kept
him in the public eye as aman occupying
the very highest range among those entiÂ­
tied to be called statesmen. It was not
mere chance that brought him this high
honor. ""We must,"" says Mr. Emerson,
""reckon success a constitutional trait. If

AS A CANDIDATE
i
Garfield grew steadily in popular favor.
- He was met with a storm of detraction at
the very hour of his nomination, and it
continued with increasing volume and
momentum until the close of his victoriÂ­
ous campaign:
No might or greatness in mortality
Can censrc 'rcape; bacekwouudlng etalmny
Thei whitest virtue strikes. \Whttking so strong

Under it all he was
CALM AND STRtONtG AND CONFIDENT,
never lost his self-possession, did no unÂ­
wise act, spoke no hasty or ill-considered
word. Indeed, nothing in his whole life
is more remarkable or more creditable
than his bearing through those five full
months of vituperation-a prolonged agoÂ­
ny of trial to a sensitive man, a constant
and cruel draft upon the powers of moral
endurance. The great mass of these unÂ­
just imputations passed unnoticed, and,
with the general debris of the campaign,
fell into oblivion. But in a few instances
the iron entered his soul, and he

ing events and current issues. To attempt
anything of the kind seemed novel, rash,
andt even desperate. The older class of
voters recalled the unfortunate Alabama
letter, in which Mr. Clay was supposed to .
have signed his political death-warrant.
They remembered also the hot-tempered
effusion by which General Scott lost a
large share of his popularity before Isis
nomination, and the unfortunate speeches
which rapidly consumed the remainder.
The younger voters had seen Mr. Greeley
in a series of vigorous and original adÂ­
dresses preparing the pathway for his own
defeat. Unmindful of these warnings,
unheeding the advice of friends, Garfield
spoke to large crowds, as be journeyed to
and from New York in August, to a great
multitude in that city, to delegations and
deputations of every kind that called at
Mentor, during the summer and autumn.
With innumerable critics watchful and I
eager to catch a phrase that might be turnÂ­
ed into odium or ridicule, or a sentence
that might be distorted to his own or his
party's injury,
.GARFIELD DID NOT TRIP OR IHALT
in any one of his 70speeches. This seems all I
the more remarkable when it is remem. i
bered that he did not write what he said,
and yet spoke with such logical consecuÂ­ i
tiveness of thought and such admirable 1
precision of phrase as to defy the accident
of misreport and the malignity of misreÂ­ 1
presentation.
In the beginning of his presidential life
Garfield's experience did not yield him 1
pleasure or satisfaction. The duties that e
engross so large a portion of the PresiÂ­
dent's time were distasteful to him, and t
were unfavorably contrasted with legislaÂ­ t
tive work.
""I have been dealing all these years with I
ideas,"" he impatiently exclaime d one day, (
""and here I'm dealing only with persons.
I have been heretofore treating of the funÂ­ I
dnmental principles of Government, and 1
here I am considering all day whether A
or B shall be appointed to this or that ofÂ­ 1
flee.""
lIe was earnestly seeking some practical
way of correcting the evils arising from t
the distribution of overgrown andt un.
wieldy patronage--evils always appreciÂ­
ated and often discussed by him, but whose c
magnitude had been more deeply impressÂ­ .
ed upon his mind since his accession to
the Presidency. Had he lived, a compreÂ­
hensive improvement in the mode of apÂ­
pointment and in thetenureofoflice would
have been proposed by him, and, with the
aid of Congress, no doubt, perfectedt. But, a
while many of the Executive duties were


not gratelut to HInt, he was assIuuous anu 1
conscientious in their discharge. From
the veryoutsetheexhibited administrative i
talent of a high order. He grasped the a
helm of oflice with the hand of a master. t
In this respect, indeed, he constantly surÂ­ p
prised many who were not most intimately s
associated with him in the Government, D
and especially those who feared he might I
be lacking in the executive faculty. His v
disposition of business was orderly and v
rapid; his power of analysis and his skill
in classification enabled him to dispatch
a vast massof detail with singular promptÂ­ I
ness and ease; his Cabinet meetings were
admirably conducted; his clear presentaÂ­ I
lion of official subjects,his well-considered
suggestions of topics on which discussion a
was invited, his quick decision when he t
had heard, combined to show a thoroughÂ­ a
ness of mental training as rare as his natÂ­
ural ability and his facile adaptation to at
new and enlarged field of labor.
WITII PEIRFECT COaIPREIHENSION
of all the inheritances of the war, with a h
cool calculation of the obstacles in the n
way, impelled always bya generous enthu.Â­ o
sinam, Garfield conceived that much might i
be done by his administration towards reÂ­
storing harmony between the different seeÂ­
tions of the Union. He was anxious to go t
South and speak to the people. As early o
as April he had ineffectually endeavored fi
to arrange for a trip to Nashville, whither o
he had been cordially invited, as he was o
again disappointed a few weeks after to fi
find out he could not go to South Carolina d
to attend the centennial commemoration c
of the victory of Cowpens; but for the Ii
autumn, he definitely counted on being h
present at three memorable assemblies in ti
the South-the celebration at Yorktown, si
the opening of the Cotton Exposition at 1
Atlanta, and the meeting of the Army of n
the Cumberland at Chattanooga. He was n
already turning over in his mind his ad-. Ii
dress lbr each occasion, and the three taiÂ­ a
ken together, he said to a friend, gave him b

own judgment involved matters of prinei.

to the constitutional admtinistrlaion of the
Federal Government. It would be out of
place here and now to speak the language
of controversy, but the events referred to,
however they may contine to be thesource
of contention with others, have become,
so far as Garfield is concerned, as much a
mattter of history as his theroism at ChickÂ­
amauga or his illustrious service in the
Hlouse. Detail is not needed full and tperÂ­

The motives of those oipposing hint are
not to be here adversely interpreted nor
their course harshly clharacterized, but of
the dead President this is to be said, aodl
said because his own speech is forever siÂ­

surviving friends. Front the beginning to

harbor revenge; rarely did he ever show
resentment; and malice was not in his narÂ­
ture. lie was congenially etmployed only
in the exchange of good offices andl the tinoÂ­
ing of kindly deeds. There was not an
hour from the beginning of the trouble
until the fatal shot entered his body when
the President would not gladly,

such retracing had lmerely involved conseÂ­
quences personal to hiiitself: The pride
of consistency, or any supposed sense of

weight with him. o mtitan was less sub.

without; but, after most anxious deliberÂ­

prerogatives of the Executive were involyÂ­

that he would be nftifithfillto his supreme

their vigor the constitutional rights and

The religious element in Garfield's charÂ­
acter was deep and earnest. In his youth
hie espoused the faiithl of the Disciples, a
sect of that great Baptist cu!ontunioht
which in different ecclesiastical establishÂ­

But however high Garfield reasoned of
""fixed fate, free will, foreknowledge abso.
lute,"" he was never separated from the
Church of the Disciples in his affections
and in his associations. For him it held
the Ark of the Covenant; to him was the
gate of heaven. The world of religious
belief is full of solecisms and contradicÂ­
tions. A philosophic observer declares
that men by the thousand will die, in deÂ­

not comprehend, and whose tenets they
habitually violate. It is equally true that

years is radically different from that which

SENERAL GARFIHED'S REELIIOUS OPIMIOxS,
as indeed of all his opinions, was his literÂ­
ality. In all things he had charity. TolÂ­
erance was of his nature. He respected
in others the qualities which he possessed
himself: sincerity of conviction and frankÂ­
ness of expression. With himthe inquiry
was not so much what a man believes, bust
does he believe it? The lines of his friendÂ­
ship and his confidence encircled men of
every creed, and men of no creed, anti to
the end of his life, on his ever-lengthening
list of friends were to be found the names
of a pious Catholic priest and an honestÂ­
minded and generous freethinker. On the
morning of Saturday, July 2, the President
was
A CONTENTED AND t.HAPPY MAN,
not in any ordinary degree, but joyfully,
almost boyish happy. On his way to the
railroad station, to which he drove slowly,
in conscious enjoyment of the beautiful
morning, with an unwooted sense of leisÂ­
ure and, a keen anticipation of pleasure,
his talk was all in the grateful and gratuÂ­
latory vein. He felt that, after four months
of trial, his Administration was strong in
his grasp of affairs, strong in popular fiaÂ­
vor, and destined to grow stronger; that
grave difficulties confronting him at his
inauguration had been safely passed; that
trouble lay behind him; that he was soon
to meet the wife whom' he loved, now reÂ­
covering from an illness which had but
lately disquieted and at times almost unÂ­
nerved; that he was going to his alma maÂ­
ter to renew the most cherished associaÂ­
tions of his young manhood, and to exÂ­
change greetings with those whose deepÂ­
ening interest had followed every step of
his upward progress from the day he enÂ­
tered upon his college course until he had
attained the loftiest position in the gift of
his countrymen. Surely, if happiness can
ever come from the honors or triumphs of
this world, on that quiet July morning,
James A. Garfield may well have been a
happy man.
NO FOREOODING OF EVIL IlHAUNTED iNM;
not the slightest premonition of danger
clouded his sky-his terrible fate was upÂ­
on him in an instant. One moment he
stood erect, strong, confident on the years
stretching peacefully out before him. The
next he lay wounded, bleeding, helpless,
doomed to weary weeks of torture, to si.
lence and the grave. Great in life, he was
surpassingly great in death. For no cause,
in the very frenzy of wantonness and
wickedness, by the red hand of murder,
lie was thrust from the full tide of this
world's interest, from its hopes, its aspiraÂ­
tions, its victories, into the visible presÂ­
ence of Death; and he did not quail, not
alone for the one short moment in which,
stunned and dazed, he could give up life,
hardly aware of its relinquishment; but
through days of deadly languor, through
weeks of agony that was not less agony
because silently borne with clearsight and
calm courage, he looked into his open
grave. What blight and ruin met his anÂ­
guished eyes! Whose lips may tell what
brilliant broken plans, what baffled high
ambitions, what sunderingof strong, warm
manhood friendships, what bitter rending
of sweet household ties! Behind him a
proud, expectant nation, a great host of
sustaining friends, a cherished and happy
mother, wearing the full, rich honors of
her early toil and tears; the wife of his
youth, whose whole life lay in his; the
little boys not yet emerged from childÂ­
hood's day of frolic; the fair young daughÂ­
ter; the sturdy sons just springing into
closest companionship, claiming every
day, and every day rewarding,

lie trotd the wine-press alone. With unÂ­
faltering front lie faced death. With unÂ­
fitiling tenderness lie took leave of life.
Above the demoniac hiss of the assassin's
bullet, lie heard the voice of God. With
simple resignation, he bowed to the Divine
decree. As the end drew near, his early
craving for the sea returned. The stately
mansion of power had been to him the
weary hospital of pain, and he begged to
be taken from its prison walls, from its
oppressive, stilling air, from its homelessÂ­
ness and its hopelessness. Gently, silentÂ­
ly, the love of a great people bore the pale
sufferer to the longed-for healing of the
sea, to live or die as God should will.

a thorough examination of the prisoner's
eyes.
THE ASSASSIN BREAKS. DOWN.
Shortly before 12 o'clock Guitean seemed
to break down completely, and burst into
tears and sobbed hysterically. Dr. Hicks
sat by his side, tanning him and vainly tryÂ­ c
ing to calm him.
About 11:30 preparations began to be
made for the execution. At 11:50 a le.
tachment of artillery was formed
on the east side of the roÂ­
tunda and brought their muskets
to parade rest. At that time about 250 penÂ­
plt were in the rotunda. Dr. Hicks was
wit!h the prisoner engaged in prayer.
The crowd outside the jail has got word
that Guitean has been banged and is rtendÂ­
ing the air with shouts, so that it Is imposÂ­
sible to hear a voice inside the jeil.
G(uitcan showed great nervousness and ""
appeared greatly startled when he heard
the rattle of muskets on the stone floor of
the rotunda. From that moment Guitean
apucared to be thoroughly overcome with
. enzmotion. He wept freely and seemed to
be in great anguish. The scene in the


roTi unua wane waiting tor rue prisoner was
long to be reme-rbered. The soldiers
wire drawn up on one side, a
long line of spectators facina
them on the other. It was understood that
G(uitcan was very much depressed, and it
was expected that his passage to the galÂ­
loes would present a very distressing
Esiht. The movement of officers about b'
the Jail door was watched with eager atÂ­ rI
tention.
2 P. M.-After the death warrant was 13

more composed, ard turning away began
to brush his hair. At 12:25

S I)r. Hlicks then produced the manuecript
,Â­ which was prepared by the prisoner this
morning and held it before him while GuitÂ­
e ean read. While Dr. Hicks was arranging
the manuscript, Guiteau exhibited a slight
net vousness and moved several times from
one foot to the other. He soon recovereG
rt his composure and looked over the sea of
sÂ­ pturned faces. ""I am now going to road to
to
you my last dying prayer."" He then read
c in a loud tone and with distinct and deÂ­
le liberate emphasis the following:
""MI DYING PRAYER ON TIE GA-LLOWS.

OAIYtACTERISTIC TO THE LAST.
At several points he had paused and enÂ­
d& avored to impart increased emphasis to
his words by the peculiar facial expression
so often observed during the trial when
angered at something which was said or
done. This was peculiarlyn oticeable when
he alluded to President 'Arthur and when
he declared that this Nation would
""go down in blooOd! When hb had
fii,ished reading his prayer be aein surÂ­
vtyed the crowd and said, still with a firm
voice: ""I ant now goine to read some

Be then commenced to chant these verses, -
in a sad, doleful style:

the dron fell and Guiteau swung in the
air. The body turned partly around, but
there was not the slightest perceptable
motion of the ""imbs. When the drop fell a
yell was sent up by some persons inside the
jail. This was re-echoed outside by a
thousand or more people, who hurrahed
lustily. There was a general onslaught by
the populace upon the jail door. The
officers were unable to withstand it. and
hundreds of people crowded into the
office.
For at least forty seconds after the drop
fell, the body hung motionless, titan
there was a slight motion of the shoulders
and legs, due to musc-ular oontraction.
Three minutes after the drop fell
the body was lowered to be examÂ­
ined by the physioians. There was
decided action of the heart for fully fourÂ­
teen minutes, and the pulse fluttered two
minutes longer. When the body had
hung with the feet just touching the grou',i
for over half an hoaur, it was lowered insl
the cofin which was waiting for it under
the scaffold. 'The physicians decided that
the neck had been broken. When the
BODY WAS LOtWElED,
the black cap was remnoved and the face
exposed. ihe features were pallid and
composed about the mouth. There was
considerable moisture after the body had
been arranged in the coffin.
Warden Croacker ascended the steps of
the scaffold, and, addressing the crowd,
asid those who desired could view the body.
Then the crowd of spectators was formed
into line, and, passing between the seaif 1ld
and the wall of the jail,viewed the remains.
Some jail officers, two or three physicians
and Dr. Hicks stood about the coflin.
John W. Gutteau joined this company and
fanned his dead brother's face to keep
away the flice. John W. Guiteau did not
goup on thescaffold, but stood during the
scene just within the line of officers at the
bottom of the steps.
When liberty was Eiven to the crowd to
view the body, the seaffold was at once
filled vilith piople, vwho curiously exa'mÂ­
lard every joint and bolt. At 1:410
P. M. the lid of the cofflin was
put In place and the body
Ibone to the fail chapel, where the physiÂ­
cians who were to make the autopsy were
assembled. After the body was taken to
the chapel arrangements were made to let
Mrs. Scovtile vie it.
Guiiean, just before the trap was sprung,
dropped a piece of paper from his hand.
This paper was given him by Warden
Crocker to be dropped by the condenmrtnd
nosn as a signal that be was ready.
John W. Gu(tean said to a reporter just
after the execution that ie waes glad it
was over. 'What will be done with the
remains?"" asked the reporter.
""We will bury him here in the.jail, where
he will be eafe,"" said a3r. Guiteau. Fie
will not be taken out of the jail. Thlie spot
indicated by Warden Crocker as GuiteCi's
burial place is in the same court as the
gallows and four yards fromn i.
Guitean, when he came out into the roÂ­
tunda, looked calm and collected, but very
l)a!e. His arms were linioned behind him
and he bad hs
had head erect. ie gazedui oon
the crowd without flinching. Re wore a
black suit of clothes, and tostead of a colÂ­
Jar had a handkerchief thrown loo-ely
about his neck. Those who expected a
""sickening"" or distressing scene were disÂ­
appointed. Gutltea walked firmÂ­
ly through the rotunda and
court. He stumbled on one of the
s.eps leading up to the scaffold, but recovÂ­
ered himself immediately. When he beÂ­
gan to read, his voice was loud and firm.
iHe gave the words now and then wi:h a
sort of sinking inflection. Mrs. SeeÂ­
ville, after waiting upon the outside
of the jail until after the execution, deÂ­
cided not to view the lemains this afterÂ­
noon, and about 2 o'clock returned to the
city.
JOHN W. GUITIIA INTERVIrWIET.
6 P. 3M.-Just before noon J. W. Guiteau
said to an Associated Press representative
that he felt cheerful so far as his brother
was concerned, believing it to be far betÂ­
ter for him to die than live. He said no
one felt keener anguish than he himself
that the crime had be-en committed wFich
plunged the Nation in grief. He believed,
however, that his brother would show
himself to be a brave man, and from his
standpoint would vindicate his idea of
patriotism. ""lls life is a wreck and
worthless,"" said John. ""and I think this ts
the most fitting end to his checkered and
insane career."" lie believed his brother
would die happy, aend, owingr to his deÂ­
mented condition, would be fortivÂ­
en in the next world. tIe
thought his brother would be happier
in death than in life, under thle cireimÂ­
stances, and if he (John) could, he would
not ask to have him reprierved. John was
in the same mood after the execuation. ""I
believe he was insane,"" said he. ""I l)reÂ­
mtiin,.Â­ inst what would haot)en--thlat he


would go bravely to item gallows. The trial
was a farce, and to day an insane man
was executed. Whether insane before

STANLEY,'S LET.TER.





Lonmow, April 2. -Henry a. Stanley's letter
describes the journey between Yambunga and
Albert Nyanza. It goes much into detail, and is
very interesting.
Mr. Stanley, after stating the orders given by
him to Major Barttellot, goes on to describe the
advance of the columns. The expedition, which
consisted of 389 officers and men, started from
Yambunge on June 28, 1887. On the first day
the expedition marched twelve miles along the
river bank to Yaknarde. On the approach of
the column the natives set fire to their villages
and under cover of the smoke attacked the
pioneers. A skirmish followed, lasting fifteen
minutes.
During the next six days the expedition
marched inland in an easterly direction through
a densely populated district. The natives used
every art known to them to molest and impede
the advance of the party,Â­ but, although several
conflicts took place, Stanley did not lose a man.
Finally perceiving that the path he had been
following was taking him out of his proper
course, Stanley struck out toward the northeast
and again reached the river on July 5. From
this day until Oct 18 ho followed the left bank
of the Aruwhimi. After seventeen days of conÂ­
tinuous marching the expedition halted for one
day's rest
On Aug. 1 the first death occurred, the cause
being dysentery. So far, for thirty-four days,
ihe course had been singularly successful. The
party entered a wild country, m their
nine days march through which their
sufferings multiplied and several deaths ocÂ­
curred. On Aug. 13, on arriving at Airsibbia,
the natives presented a bold front and the
party lest five men from poisoned arrows.
Lieutenant Starrts was wounded below the
heart and suffered greatly, but he recovered.
On Aug. 31 the expedition met a patty of WanÂ­
yemas, and their misfortunes began on this
date. Stanley writes, that he had taken the
Congo route to avoid Arabs, who would tempt
his men. Within three days of this unfortunate
meeting twenty-six men deserted.
A BAD MONTIL
What Stanlev describes as an awful month
begins on Sept. 18. Leaving the station of the
Arab chief Ugarrava, when the expedition numÂ­
bered 263 men, having lost sixty-six by deserÂ­
tion and death, and having left fifty-six sick
with Ugarrava, the march led to the Arab setÂ­
tlement of latinga Lonas. The men
lived on wild fruits, fungi and nuts.
Before reaching Kilinga Longa Stanley lost 55
ioen through starvation and desertion. A slave
owner at Filinga Longa, named Abedsalim, did
his ultmost to ruin the expedition, short of open
hostilities. He insisted upon purchasing rifles,
ammunition and clothing, to that the exidition
lbft the station beggared. The men were abÂ­
solutely naked and were so weak that they were
unable to carry the. boat. Stanley
was therefore obliged to leave the
boat, together with seventy loads of
goods at Kilings Louga, under the
care of Surgeon Poke and Captain Nelson, the
latter of whom was unable to march. After a
twelve days' journey, the party on Nov. 2
reached Ibwiri The Arab devastation, which
had reached within a few miles of Ibwirn, was
so thorough that not a native hut was left standÂ­
ing between Ugarrava and Ibwirf. What the
Arabs did not destroy the elephants destroyed,
turning the region into a horrible wilderness.
Mr. Stanley continues: Our sufferings terÂ­
minated at Ihwiri We were beyond the reach
of destroyers. We were on virgin soil in a
populous region abounding with food. We ourÂ­
selves were mere skeletons. From 289 perÂ­
sons we now numbered 174. Several of the
party seeming to have


NO HOPE OF LIFE LEFT,
a halt was therefore ordered for the purpose of
recuperating. Hitherto our people were sknpÂ­
tical of what we told them. The suffering
had been so awful, the calamitids so
numerous, and the forests so endless,
that tley refused to believe that by
and by we would see plains and cattle, the
Nyanza, and Emin Pasha. They had turned a
deaf ear to our prayers and entreaties for,
driven by hunger and suffering, they sold their
rifles and equipments for a few ears of Indian
corn, deserted with the ammunition,and became
altogether demoralized. Perceiving that mild
punishment would be of no avail, I resorted
to the death penalty, and two of
the worst cases were . hanged nm the
presence of all We halted tor thirteen days at
lbwiri, reveling on goats, bananas, corn, etc.
The supplies were inexhaustible, and our people
glutted themselves with such effect that we had
173 sleek and robust men. One had been killed
with an arrow.
When we started for Albert Nyanza, on Nov.
,24, we were still 126 miles from the lake.
Given food, the distance seemed nothing. On
Dec. 1 we sighted,an open country from the
top of a ridge connected with Mount Pisgah,
which was so named from our first view of
the land of promise and plenty. On Dec. .5
we emerged ulon the.plains, leaving the deadly
and gloomy forest behind us. After 160 days
of continuous gloom we saw the light of Droad
day shining all around, making all things beauÂ­
tif ii. We thought we had never seeu grass so
gr an or a country so lovely. The men literÂ­
ally leaped for joy and raced over tho ground
with their burdens. Ah, this was the old
spirit of former exoeditions, successfully comÂ­
pleted, and all suddenly revived. Woe betide
the native aggressor whom we may-meet
However powerful, with such a spirit the
men will fling themselves upon him like wolves
on sheep. Numbers will not be considered.
It was the eternal forest that had made them the
-abject, slavish creatures so brutally plundered
by Arab slaves at Kiliuga Longa. On the 9th
we entered the country of the powerful chief,
.azamboni. The villages were scattered so
thickly that no road except through them could
be found. The natives sighted us, but we were
prepared. We seized a hill as soon as we
arrived in the center of a mass of tillages, and
built a zareba as fast as bill-hooks could out the
brushwood. The
WAt CitIES WERE TERRIBLE
from bill to bill, pealing across the intervening
valleys. The people gathered in hundreds at
every point, war horns and. drums announcing
the struggle After a slight skirmish, ending
in our capturing a cow, the flrt.: beef we hads




 tasted since we left the ocean, the night passed
peacefully, both sides preparing for. the mor-.
row.""
Here Mr. Stanley narrates how negotiations
with the natives failed, Mazambom declining a
peace offering, and how a .detachment of forty
persons, led by Lieutenant Stairs, and another
of thirty, under command of Mr. Jephson, with
;harpshooters, left the Zareba and assaulted
and carried the villages, driving the natives into
ageneral route. The march was resumed on
the 12th, There were constant little fights all
:long the rout On the afternoon of the 13th,
says MAr Stanley, we sighted the Nyanza, with
Kavalli, the objective point of the expedition.
Six miles off I had told the men to prepare to
see the Nianzia. They murmured and doubted,
saying, ""Why does the master continually talk
this way? Nyanzi, indeed."" When they saw
the Nyanza below them many came to kissÂ­ my
hands.
""We were now at an altitute of 5.200 feet
above the sea, with the Albert Nyanza 2,900
feet below, In 1 degree 20 minutes.. The south
end of the Nyanza lay largely mapped for about

wast After a short halt to enjoy the prospect,
we commenced the ragged and stony descent.
Before the rear guard had descended 100 feet
the natives from the plateau poured after them,
keeping the rear guard busy until within a few
hundred feet of the Nyanza plain. We camped
at the foot of the plateau wall.
""We afterward approached the village of
Kakongo, situated at the southwest corner of
Albert Lake. Three hours were spent by us in
attempting to make friends, but we signally
failed. They would not allow us to go to the
lake' because we might frighten their cattle.
They would not exchange the blood of brotherÂ­
hood because they never heard of any good
people coming from the west side of the
lake. They would not accept any present from
us because they did not know who we were.
But they would give us water to drink and
would show us the road up to Nyam-Sassic
From these singular people we learned that
they had heard that there was a white man at
Unyoro, but they had never heard of any white
men being on the west side, nor had they over
seen any steamers on the lake. There was no
excuse for quarreling.. The people were civil
enough, but they did not want us near them.
We therefore were shown the path and followed
it for miles.
""We camped about one-half mile from the
lake ;and then began to consider our position
with the light thrown: upon it by the conversa-.
tion with the Kakong natives. My couriers
from Zanzibar had evidently not arrived; or
Emn Pasha, or his two steamers, would have'
paid the southwest side of the lake a visit to
prepare the natives for our coming. My boat
was at Kilinga Longs, 190 miles distant and
there was no canoe obtainable. To sieze a
canoe without the excuse of a quarrel my conÂ­
science would not permit There was no
tree anywhere of a size sufficient to make'
canoes. Wadelai was a terrible distance off for
an expedition so reduced. We had used five
cases of cartridges on five days' fighting on the
plain. A month of such fighting must exhaust
our stock. There was no .plan suggested that
was feasible, except to


RETREAT' TO IBWI:I,
build a fort, send the party back to Kilinga
Loniga for a boat, stord""i'p every load in the
fort not 'cn'veyable, leave t garrison in the
fort to'hold it, march back to Albert Lake, and
send a boat in search of Emin Pasha. This
was the plan which, .after lengthy disÂ­
cussionus with the officers, I - resolved
upon. On the 15th we began
a night inarch, andby 10 a. m. on the 16th we
bad gained the crest of the plateau :once more,
the Kakonhoes natives having persisted in folÂ­
lowing us to the slope of the plateau. We had
one man killed and one wounded. On January
7 we were in lbwiri once again. After a few
d-ys rest, Lieutenant Stairs, with one hundred
men, was sent to Kilinga Louga to bring the
boat and goods. I also sent Surgeon Parke and
Captain Nelson. Out of the thirty-eight sick
men in their charge only eleven were brought
to the fort. The rest had diedlor deserted. On
the return of Stairs with the boat and goods he
was sent to Ugarrowas. Soon after his departure
I was attacked by gastritis and an abscess on
the arm. After a month's careful nursing by
Parke I recovered and set out again for the AlÂ­
bertNyanza on April 2, accompanied by JephÂ­
son and Iarke. Nelson was appointed comÂ­
mandant of Fort Bodo in our absence, with a
garrison of forty-three men and boys On April
20 we larrived in Mozambini's country again.
This time, after solicitation. Mozambini decided
to mike blood brotherhood with me. His exÂ­
ample was followed by all the other chiefs as
fir as the Nyanza. Every difficulty seemed
now to be removed. Food was supplied gratis
Cattle, goats, sheep and fowls were also given in
abundance, so that our peopli lived royally.
When one day's march from tuo Nyanza, the
natives came from Kavi1li and said that a white
man named Malejja had given their chief a
black packet to give me, his son. Woald I folÂ­
low them. they asked. 'Yes, to-morrow,' I anÂ­
swered; 'and if your words are true I will make
you'r!ch?' They remained with us that night,
telling us wonderful stories about big ships as
large as islands filled with men, etc., which left
no doubt in our mind that the white than was
Emin Pasha. The next day's march brought us
to Chief Kavali. After a while he handed lne
A NOTE FROMI EMIN PASHS,
covered with a strip of black American oil
cloth. The note was to the effect that as their
had been a native rumor that a white man had
been seen at the south end of the lake, he had
gone in a steamer to make inquiries, but 'ihad
been unable to obtain rehable information. He
begged me to remain where I was until he could
communicate with me. The next day, April
23,
. Mr. Jephson was dispatcheed with
a strong force to tao the boat
to the Nyanza On the 20th the boat's
crew sighted Alawa Station, the most southern
post eelonging to Emmin Pasha. Mri Jephson was
there hospitably received by the Egyptian:.garÂ­
rison.' Ti'e boat's crew say that they were emÂ­
braced one by one, and that they never had
such attention shown to them as by these men,
who hailed them as brothers. An April 29 we
once again reached the bivouac ground occuÂ­
vied by us on Dec. 16, and at 5 p. m. of that
day I-saw the Khedive's steamer about seven
miles : away Steaming up toward us.
Soon after 7 p. m. Emin Pasha, Signor Casati,
and Mt Jephson arrived at our camp, where
they were heartily welcomed by ill of us.
I Next day we moved to a better camping place
about three miles above Nyamsassie, and atthis
spot Emie Pasha also made his camp. We were
togetner until May 25, when I left him, leaving
Mr. Jephbon, three Soudanese, and Zanzibaris
in'his care. In return he caused to accompany
me three of his irregulars andÂ­ 102 Madi
natives as' porters. Foulrteen days later I was
at Fort Bodoe. At the fort were Captain Nelson
and Lieutenant-Stairs.. The latter had returned
from Ugarrowas twenty-two days after I
had set out for the lake, bringing with hlim,
alas, only sixteen men out of the fifty-six; all
the rest were dead. May 20 couriers whom I
had. sent with letters to Major Barttellot had
sat oly left Ugarrowas for Yambuga on March 16.
Fort Bodo was in a flourishing condition.
Nearly ten acres; were under cultivation. One
crop of Indian corn had been harvested and was
in the granaries. On June .16 I left
Fort Bodo with 111 Zanzibarists and 101 of
Emin's people ILieutenant Stairs was appointed
'commandant of the fort Captain Nelson was
second in command, and S:uigeon Parke was
medical offieer. The garrison consisted of fiftyÂ­
nine riftes. I thus deprived myself of. all my
officers in order not to, be encumbered with'bagÂ­
gage; provisions, and medicines, which would
iave to be takenif accompanued by Europeans.
On june 24 we roachedÂ­ Kilingas and on July
19 Ugarrowas. The latter station was deÂ­
serteud Ugarrowas having
"" ' GATHERED AS MUOH IVORY
as he could obtahii 'from the district; had proÂ­
ceeded down the river about.three months ba




 fore. On leaving Fort Sdo I hald loaded every
carrier with 6(0 pounds of corn so that we were
able to pass through tile wilderness iunscatled.
Passing on down. the iiver as fast as' we could
go, daily expecting to meet the couriers, who
had been stimulated. to exert themselves for a
reward of ""10': p-ounds 'per head, .or
the Major -himself,.. leading an army
of carriers, we ifidulged, ourselves .:in
pleasant anticipation: as we. neaed the,
goal On Aug. 10 we overtook Ugarrowas
with an immense flotilla of iffty-seven canoes,
and,-to our wonder, our couriers, now, reduced
to seventeen, who related. an awful ,stor'y of
hairbreadth escapes and tiagic scenes.. Three
had been slain; two were still feeble from
wounds; all except five bore on their bodies the
scars of arrow wounds,
A week later, Aug. 17, we met the rear.colÂ­
umn of the expedition at Bunalya. There was
a white man at the gate of the stockade who
at first I thought: wa MrhI Jamieaon.
A nearer view revealed the features of Mr.
Bonney, who left the medical servioc of the
army to accompany us.
""Well, my dear Bonney, where's the Major?""
I asked. -
""He is dead, sir; shot by a Mauyuema about
a month ago,"" replied Bonney.
""Good God,"" I cried, '""aind Jamieson?""
""He has gone to Stanley.Falls to try to get
more men from Tippoo Tib.""
""And Troup?""
""Troup has gone home invalided;""
""Well, where is Ward?""
""Ward is atJlangala.""
""Heaven alive, then you are the only one
here?""
""Yes, sir.""
After describing what a wreck hlie found the
rear column,to be. Stanley complains of the ofÂ­
ficers at Yambuga too readily accepting the, deÂ­
serter's report of his death and sending his perÂ­
sonal kit, medicines, eta, down the Congo.leavÂ­
ing him naked.of necessities to return to Emin..
""By accident,"" he says, ""two hats, a fair pair of
boots, and a flannel jacket were left, a truly Af-.
rican kit, with which to return.""
THE GiEAT FORESTS,
The letter then proceeds to summarize what
had been accomplished. Stanley says: ""We
were 160 days in the forest-one continuous,
unbroken, compact forest. The grass land was
traversed by us in eight days.' T'he limits of
the forest along the 'edge of the grass laud are
well marked. We saw it extonding northeasterly,
witn its curves, bays and capes just like a seaÂ­
shore.' Southwesterly it preserved the same
character. North and south the forest area exÂ­
tends from Nyangivo to the southern borders of
Monbuttu, east aild west it omabraces all from
the Congo, at the mouth of the Aruwimi to
about east longitude 29 degrees, latitude 40
degrees. How far west beyond the Congo
the forest' reaches I: do not know.
*The superficial extent of the tract described toÂ­
tally covered by forest, is 246,000 square
miles. North of tihe Congo, between Upsoto
and Arnwimi, the forest embraces 'another 20,Â­
000 square miles, Between Yambuga and
Nyauza we came across 'five distinct
languages. The land slopes gentle from
the crest of the plateau about the Nvyanza
diown to the Congo River, from an altitude of
5,500 feet to 1,400 above the sea.' North and.
south of our track through the grass land the
face of the land was much broken by. groups of
cones or isolated mountain ridges. To the
north we saw no land higher than about 6,000
'feet above the sea, but at a dietanid of fifty
miles from our. caiml on. the Nyanza,
we saw a . towering mountÂ­
am, its summit covered with snow,
probably 17,000 feet or 18,000 feet above tihe.
sea. It is called lueyvenzon, and wdll' prove a
rival to Kelimarriio. ,I am not sure that it may
not prove to be QGoidon Bennett Mountain in,
Gaberiara, but there are two reasons for doubtÂ­
ing it to be the same. In tihe first place, it is too'

force in near proximity to the United States
Long and continued applause.
On motion of Bushnell, of Conn., the resoluÂ­
tions were adopted by acclamation. --.
A motion was then made that the house proÂ­
ceed at once to nominate for President and Vice
President. .
Gen. Cameron, of Pa., offered as a substitute
a resolution that Abraham Lincoln and HanniÂ­
bal Hamlin be declared the uuanimous choice of
the Union party for Presideut and Vice PresiÂ­
dent. Great cheering and loud calls for a divisÂ­
ion of the resolution.
Mr. Cresswell, of Md., called for a division of
the question so as to vote first on that portion
of the resolution declaring Abraham Lincoln
the choice of the Convention as its candidate for
the Presidency of the United States.
Mr. Stevens moved to lay the resolution on
the table. ( Great confusion, cheering, and cries
of question.) ... . '
Mr. Cameron withdrew his resolution, and
offered another.
Rewlved, That Abraham Lincoln be declared
the uuanimous choice of the Union party, as its
nominee for President of the United States.
As the vote was about being taken Mr. RayÂ­
mond urged that the vote should be taken by
States. That as it had been said there was a disÂ­
position to rush the nomination of Mr. Lincoln
through this Convention, and to stifle any conÂ­
trary expression of sentiment, such a vote would
carry with it more of power and influence than
the passage of any such resolution.
The proposition' was well received. Amidst
much confusion the States were called. The
result was as follows:
For Mr. Lincoln Maine, 14; New Harashire,
10; Vermont, 10; Massachusetts, 24; Rhode IsÂ­
land, 8; Connecticut, 12 New York, 66; New

vjtry highly the coniidence and respect

the nomination with a feeling of gratiÂ­
tude and a full sense of the responsibilÂ­
ities which accompany it.

Regarding the Tariff,

It is a matter

of

of

congratulation that

the declarations of the Chicago convenÂ­
tion upon the questions that now attract
the interest of our people are so clear
and emphatic. There is further cause of
congratulation in the fact that the conÂ­
vention utterances of the Democratic
party, if in any degree uncrrtuiu and
contradictory, can now be judged aud
interpreted by executive acts aud mesÂ­
sages, and by definite propositions in
legislation. This is especially true of
what is popularly known as tlie tariff
question. The issue cannot now be ob
scured. It is not a contest between
cheduies, but between wide apart prin-

Spies. The foreign competitors for our
""market have, with quick instinct, seen
how one issue of this contest may bring
them advantage, and our own people are
not so dull as to miss or neglect the grave

Interests that are involved for them.

Kaedless Hoarding of Fuads.

The fact of a treasury surplus, the
amout of which is variously stated, has
directed public attention to a consideraÂ­
tion of the methods by which the
national income may best be reduced to
the level of a wise and necessary exÂ­
pendtture. This condition has been
seized nnou by those who are hostile to I
protective customs duties as an advauÂ­
tageous base of attack upon our tar:
if
laws. They have magnified and nursed
the surplus, which they affect to depreÂ­
cate, seemingly for the purpose of exagÂ­
gerating the evil in order to reconcile
the people to the extreme remedy they
propose. A proper reduction of the revÂ­
ennes does not necessitate, and should
not suggest, the abandonment or impairÂ­
intfnt of the protective system. The
metho's suggested by our convention
will not need to be exhausted iu order to
elfect the necessary reduction. We are
not likely to be called upon, 1 thiuk, to
make a presteut choice between the surÂ­
render of the protective system and the
entire repeal of the internal taxes. Such
a contingency, in view of the present
local revenue expenditures, is remote.
The inspection and regulation of the
manufacture and sale of oleomargarine
is important, and the revenue derived
from it is not so great that the repeal of
the law need enter into any plan of revÂ­
enue reduction. The surplus now iu the
treasury should be used in the purchase
of bonds. The law authorizes this use of
it, aud if it is not- used for current or deÂ­
ficiency appropriations. the people, and
bauks in which it has been deposited,
should have the advautage of its use by
stopping interest upon the public debt.
At least those who needlessly hoard it
should not be allowed to r.se the fear of
a monetary stringency, thus produced,*
to coerce public sentiment upon other
questions.

Importation of Foreign Labor.

Closely connected with the subject of
the tariff is that of the importation of
foreign laborers under contracts of serÂ­
vice to be performed here. The law now
in force prohibiting such contracts reÂ­
ceived my cordial support in the senate,
and such amendments as may be found
necessary effectively to deliver our workÂ­
ingmeu and women from this most inÂ­
equitable form of competition will have
my sincere advocacy. Legislation proÂ­
hibiting the importation of laborers
under contracts to serve here will, howÂ­
ever, afford very inadequate relief to our
working people, if the system of protecÂ­
tive duties is broken down. If the proÂ­
ducts of American shops must compete
in the American market, without favorÂ­
ing duties, with the products of cheap
foreign labor, the effect will be different,
if at all, only in degree, whether the
cheap labor is across the street or over
the sea. Such competition will soon reÂ­
duce wages here to the level of those
abroad, und when that condition is
reached we will not need any laws forÂ­
bidding the importation of labor under
contractâ€”they will have no inducement
to come, and the employer no induceÂ­
ment to send for them.

On tlie Chinese Question.

In the earlier years of our history pubÂ­
lic agencies to promote immigration
were common. The pioneer wanted a
neighbor with more friendly instincts
than the Iudian. Labor was scarce and
fully employed. But the day of the imÂ­
migratiou bureau has gone ""by. While
our doors will continue open to proper
immigration, we do not need to issue
special invitations to the iuhabitauts of
other countries to come to our shores or
to share our citizenship. Indeed, the
necessity of some inspection and limitaÂ­
tion is obvious. We should resolutely
refuse to permit foreign governments to
send their paupers and criminals to our
ports. We are also clearly under a duty
to defend our civilization by excluding
alien races wiiose ultimate assimilation
with our people is neither possible or deÂ­
sirable. The family has been the nucleus
of our best immigration, and the home
the most potent assimilating force in our
civilization.

The objections to Chinese immigration
are distinctive and conclusive, and are
now so generally accepted as such that
the question has passed entirely beyond
tlie stage of argument. The laws relatÂ­
ing to this subject would, if

I

should be

charged with their enforcement, be faithÂ­
fully executed. Such amendments or
further legislation as may, be necessary
and proper to prevent evasions of the
laws aud to stop further Chinese immiÂ­
gration would also meet my approval.
The expression of the convention upon
this subject is in entire harmony with
my views.

A Free Ballot Box.

Our civil compact is a government by
majorities and the law loses its sanctiou
and the magistrate our respect when this
compact is broken. The evil results of
election frauds do not expend themselves
upon the voters who are robbed of their
rightful influence in public affairs. The
individual, or community, or party, that
practices or connives at election frauds
has suffered irreparable injury and will
sooner or later realize that to exchange
the American system of majority rule for
minority control is not only unlawful and
unpatriotic, but very unsafe for those
who promote it. The disfranchisement
of a single legal elector by fraud or inÂ­
timidation is a crime too grave to be reÂ­
garded lightly. The right of every qualÂ­
ified elector to cast one free ballot and to
have it honestly counted must not be
questioned. Kvery constitutional power
should be used to make this right secure
and to punish frauds upon the ballot.

Our colored people do not ask special
legislation iu their interest, but only to
be made secure in the common rights of
American citizenship. They will, howÂ­
ever, naturally mistrust the sincerity of
those party leaders who appeal to their
race for support only in those localities
where the suffrage is free and election
results doubtful, aud compass their disÂ­
enfrancliisement where tlieirvotes would
be controlling and their choice cannot be
coerced.

Liberal Aid fo Education.

The nation, no less than the states, is
dependent for prosperity aud security
upon the intelligence and morality of the
people. This common intercut very early
suggested national aid iu the establishÂ­
ment and endowment of schools and colÂ­
leges in the new states. There is, I beÂ­
lieve, a present exigency that calls for
still more liberal and direct appropriaÂ­
tions in aid of common school education
In the states.

Juvtiee to tlie Territories.

The territorial form of government is
ri temporary expedient, not a permanent
civil condition. It is adapted to the exÂ­
igency that suggested it, but becomes inÂ­
adequate, and even oppressive, when apÂ­
plied to fixed and populous communities.
Several territories are well able to bear
the burdens aud discharge the duties of
free commouweaitfcs in the American
union. To exclude is to deny the just
ights of their people, and may well exÂ­
cite their iudignant protest. No question

declaration

agaiust ""all combinations of capital,
organized in trusts or otherwise, to conÂ­
trol arbitrarily the condition of trade
among our citizens,"" is in harmony with
the views entertained and publicly exÂ­
pressed by me long before the assembling
of the convention. Ordinarily, capital
shares the losses of idleness with labor
but under the operation of the trust, iu
somf of its forms, the wage worker alone
surfers loss, while idle capital receives
dividends from a trust fund. Producers
who refuse to join the combination are
destroyed, and competition as an eleÂ­
ment of prices is eliminated. It cannot
be dftubted t! t'.ie legislative authority
should and will liuil a method of dealing
fairly and eiTeetively with these and
other abuses uneetcd with this subÂ­
ject.

In Belialr of the Veterans.

It can hardly be necessary for me to
say that I am heartily iu sympathy with
the declaration of the convention upou
the subject of peusions to our soldiers
and sailors.

W'hai

they gave and what

they suffered I had some opportunity to
observe and, iu a measure, to experience.
They gave ungrudgingly: it was not a
trade, but tin offering. The measure
was heaped up. running over. What
they achieved, only a distant generation
can adequately tell.

Without attempting to discuss particuÂ­
lar propositions, I may add that measÂ­
ures in behalf of the surviving veterans
of the war and of the families of their
dead comrades should be conceived and
executed iu a spirit of justice and of the
most grateful liberty, and that, in the
competition for civil appointments, honÂ­
orable military service should have apÂ­
propriate recognition.

For True Civil Service Reform.

The law regulating appointments to
the classified civil. service rceived my
support iu the senate in the belief that it
opened the way to a much needed reÂ­
form. I still think so, and, therefore,
cordially approve the clear and forcible
expression of the convention upon this
subject. The law should have the aid of
a friendly interpretation and be
faithfully and vigorously enforced. All
appointments under it should be absoÂ­
lutely free from partisan considerations
and influence. Some extensions of the
classified list are practicable and desirÂ­
able, aud further legislation extending
the reform to other branches of the servÂ­
vice, to which it is applicable, would reÂ­
ceive my approval. In appointments to
every grade aud department, fitness, and
not party service, should be the essential
and discriminating test, and fidelity and
efficiency the only sure tenure of office.
Only the interests of the public service
should suggest removals from office. I
know the practical difficulties attending
the attempt to apply the spirit of the
civil service rules to all appointments
and removals. It will, however, be my
sincere purpose, if elected, to advance
the reform.

Temperance and the Home.

I notice with pleasure that the conÂ­
vention did not oinit to express its soliciÂ­
tude for the promotion of virtue and
temperance among our people. The ReÂ­
publican party has always been friendly
to everything that tended to make the
home life of our people free, pure and
prosperous, and will in the future be
true to its history in this respect.
Xo Weak and Vacillating Foreign Policy.

Our relations with foreign powers
should be characterized by friendliness
and respect The right of our people and
of our ships to hospitable treatment
should be insisted upou with dignity and
firmness. Our uation is too great, both
iu material strength and mornl power, to
indulge in bluster or to be suspected of
timorousness. Vacillation and inconsisÂ­
tency are as incompatible with successÂ­
ful diplomacy as they are with the naÂ­
tional dignity. We should especially
cultivate and extend our diplomatic and
commercial relations with the Central
and South American states. Our fishÂ­
eries should be fostered and protected.
The hardships and risks tliat are the
necessary incidents of the business should
not be increased by an inhospitable exÂ­
clusion from the near lying ports. The
resources of a firm, dignified and conÂ­
sistent diplomacy are undoubtedly equal
to the prompt and peaceful solution of
the difficulties that now exist. Our
neighbors will surely not expect in our
ports a commercial hospitality they deny
to us in theirs.

Chicago Platform Is Ail Right.

I cannot extend this letter by a special
reference to other subjects upou which
the convention gave an expression. In
respect to them, as well as to those I
have noticed, I am in entire agreement
with the declarations of the convention.
The resolutions relating to the coinage,
to the rebuilding of the navy, to coast
defenses and to public lands, express conÂ­
clusions to all of which I gave my supÂ­
port in the senate. Inviting a calm and

innn nf

thoughtful consideration of these public
questions, we submit them to the people.
Their intelligent patriotism and the good
providence that made and has kept us a
nation will lead them to wise and safe
conclusions. Very respectfully, your
obedient servant,

BEXJAMIS HARRISON.

COMMENTS OF CRITICS.

NEW YORK, Sept. 13.â€”Thepapers comÂ­
ment on Gen. Harrison's letter of acceptÂ­
ance as follows:

Tribune: This letter will take a high
place in the literature of our politics. It
is in such effective contrast to tlie dull
labored, verbose and egotistical letter of
the Democratic candidate that it seems
almost unkind on the part of Gen. HarriÂ­
son to bring them before the people in
close juxtaposition. It is courageous,
frank, simple and unaffected. Many of
its phrases pierce the Democratic armor
like sword thrusts. It is a letter that
will make votes, is worthy of the leader
of a great party, and demonstrates his
fitness for the presidency as well as the
public need that the principles he repreÂ­
sents shall prevail. It is the letter of a
good fighter.

Times: Mr. Harrison accepts the
publicau nomination in a letter that
notable for nothing except its weak and
safe generalizations. His letter betrays
only such a superficial acquaintance
with public affairs as any busy and fairly
intelligent lawyer might gain from a
hasty daily perusal of his morniug papers
on his way to business. The policies and
principles approved in the letter are set
forth in vague and general terms, and

RETURN OF CAPTAIN M'CLINTOCK, R.N.
The. Fox screw discovery vessel (Captain M'ClinÂ­
took, R.N.), which had been sent to the Arctic
Regions, at the expense of Lady Franklin, to disÂ­
cover traces of the missing expedition, arrived off
the Isle of Wight on Wednesday. On landing
Captain M'Clintock at once came on by train for
London, bringing with him two cases containing
relics of the long missing expedition of Sir John
Franklin.
We have been favoured by the Secretary of the
Admiralty with the accompanying letter:
""YACHT FOX, R.Y.S.
"" Sir.-I beg yon will inform the Lords ComÂ­
missioners of the Admiralty of the safe return to this
country of Lady Franklin's final searching expediÂ­
tion, which I have had the honour to conduct.
Their lordships will rejoice to hear that our
endeavoare to ascertain the fate of the I Franklin
Expedition' have met with complete success.
"" At Point Victory, upon the N.W. coast of King
William Island, a record has been found, dated April
25, 1848, and signed by Captains Crozier and FitzÂ­
james. By it we were informed that her Majesty's
ships Erebus and Terror were abandoned on April
22, 1848, in the ice, five leagues to the N.N.W.,
and that the survivors, in all amounting to 105
souls, under the command of Captain Crozier, were
proceeding to the Great Fish River. Sir John
Franklin had died on June 11, 1847.
""Mny deeply interesting relics of our lost counÂ­
trymen have been picked up upon the western shore
of King William Island, and others obtained from
the Esquimaux, by whom we were informed that
(subsequent to their abandonment) one ship was
crushed and sunk by the ice, and the other forced
on shore, where she has ever since remained, affordÂ­
ing them an almost inexhaustible mine of wealth.
""1 Being unable to penetrate beyond Bellot
Straits, the Fox wintered in Brentford Bay, and
the search-including the estuary of the Great
Fish River, and the discovery of 800 miles of coast
line, by which we have united the explorations of
the former searching expeditions, to the north and
west of our position, with those of James Ross,
Dease, and Simpson, and Rae to the south-has
been performed by sledge journeys this spring, con.
ducted by Lieutenant Hobson, R.N., Captain Allen
Young, and myself.
""As a somewhat detailed report of our proceedÂ­
ings will doubtless be interesting to their lordships,
it is herewith enclosed, together with a chart
of our discoveries and explorations; and at the
earliest opportunity I will present myself at the
Admiralty to afford further information, and lay
before their lordships the record found at Point
Victory.

The words "" wintered in 1846-47 at Beechey

were beset in the ice, and ships abandoned in April,
1848. The same mistake occurs in both papers.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE YACHT FOX.
CONTINrRuD rRox MY, 1858.
It va Al be remembered that the Fox effected her escape out
of the main pack in Davis's Straits, in lat. 63i deg. N., on
25th April, 1858, after a winter's ice drift of 1,194 geograÂ­
phical miles.
The small settlement of Holsteinborg was reached on the
28th, and such very scanty supplies obtained as the place
afforded.
On May 8 our voyage was recommenced; Godhaven and
;Upernivik visited, Melville Bay entered early in Jane, and
crossed to Cape York by the 26th. Here SDMe natives were
communicated with. They immediately recognised Mr.
Petersen, our interpreter, formerly known to them in the
Grinnell expedition, under Dr. Zane. In reply to our
inquiries for the Esquimaux dog driver "" Hans,"" left behind
from the Advance in 1858, they told us that he was residing
at Whale Sound. Had he been there I would most gladly
have embarked him, ashis longing to return to South GreenÂ­
land continues unabated.
On 12th July communicated with the Cape Warrender
natives, near Cape Horeburgh; they had not seen any ships
since the visit of the Phoenix in 1854, nor have any wrecks
6 ever drifted upon their Shores.
it, was nec uttil 27th July that we reached Pond's Inlet
owing to a most unusual prevalence of ice in the northera
portion of Baffin's Bay, and which rendered our progress
since leaving Holsteinborg one of increasing struggle.
Without steam power we could have done nothing. Here
only one old woman and a boy were found, but they served
to pilot us up the inlet for 25 miles, when we arrived at their
village. For about a week we were in constant and moet inÂ­
teresting communication with these friendly people. Briefly,
L the information obtained from them was, that nothing whatÂ­
I ever respecting the Franklin expedition had come to their
knowledge, nor had any wrecks within the last 20 or 30
years reached their shores.
L The remains of three wrecked ships are known to them;
two of these appear to have been the whalers Dexterity and
Aurora, wrecked in August, 1821, 70 or 80 miles southward
of Pond's Inlet. The third vessel, now almost buried in
the sand, lies a few miles east of Cape Hay. This people
communicate overland every winter with the tribes at
Igloolik; they all knew of Perry's ships having wintered
there in 1822-3, and had heard of late years of Dr. Rae's
visit to Repulse Bay, describing his boats as similar to our
l whale boat, and his party as living in tents, within snowÂ­
houses, smoking pipes, shooting reindeer, &e. None died.
They remained there only one winter.
No rumour of the lost expedition has reached them.
Within Pond's Inlet the natives told us the ice decays away
every year, but so long as any remains whales aboundÂ­
Several large whales were seen by us, and we found amongst
the natives a considerable quantity of whalebone and many
norwhals' horns, which they were anxious to barter for
knives, tiles, saws, rifles, and wool; they drew us some rude
charts of the inlet, showing that it expands into an extensive
3 channel looking westward into Prince Regent's Inlet.
We could not but regret that none of our own whaling
friende-from whom we had recently received so much kindÂ­
f ness-were here to profit by so favourable an opportunity.
r Leaving Pond's Inlet on 6th August, we reached Beechy
Island on 11th, and landed a handsome marble tablet, sent on
board for this purpose by Lady Franklin, bearing an approÂ­
priate inscription to thy memory of our lost countrymen in
I the Erebus and Terror.
f The provisions end stores seemed in perfect order, but a
small boat was much damaged from having been turned over
e and rolled along the beach by a storm. The roof of the house
received some necessary repairs. Having embarked some
coals and stores we stood in need of, and touched at Cape




 Hothamn ot the 16th, we sailed down PeeM Strait
for 25 miles on the 17th, but finding the reÂ­
rnalder of this channel covered by unbroken ice,
I determined to make for Bellot Strait on the 19.h
of August, examined into supplies remaining at Port LeoÂ­
pold, and left there a whale-boat which we brought away
trom Cape Hotham fur the purpose, so as to aid us in our reÂ­
treat should we be obliged eventually to abandon the Fox
The steam lunch had been forced higher up on the beach,
and somewhat damaged by the ice. Prince Regent's Inlet
was unusually free from ice, but very little was seen during
our run down to Brentford Bay, which we reached on the
20th August. Bellot Strait, which communicates with the
western sea, averages one mile in width by 17 or 18 miles in
length. At this time it was filled with drift ice, bhtt as the
season advanced became perfectly clear; its shores are in
many places faced with lofty granite cliffs, and some of the i
adjacent hills rise to 1,600 feet; the tides are very strong, I
running six or seven knots at the springs. On the l
6th of September we passed through Bellot Strait
without obstruction, and secured the ship to fixed
ice across its weetern outlet. From here, until the
27th, when I deemed it necessary to retreat into winter I
quarters, we constantly watched the movements of the ice in t
the western sea or channel. In mid-channel it was broken i
up and drifting about; gradually the proportion of water inÂ­ t
creased, until at length the ice which intervened was reÂ­
duced to three orfour miles in width. But this was firmly
held fast by numerous islets, and withstood the -iolence Of
the autumn gales. It was tantalizing beyond description thus
to watch from day to day the free water which we could not
reach, and which washed the rocky shore a few miles to the t
southward of us. I
Daring the autumn attempts were scads to carry out deÂ­ t
pots of provisions towards the magnetic pole, but these i
almost entirely failed owing to the disruption of the ice to I
the southward. Lieutenant Hobeon returned with his sledge
parties in November, after much suffering from severe weaÂ­ I
ther, and imminent peril on one occasion, when the ice upon
which they were encamped became detached from the shore,
and drifted off to the leeward vith them. t
Our wintering position was at the east entrance to Xi
Ballot Strait in a snug harbov', which I have named Port I
Kennedy, after my predecessor in these waters, the comÂ­ I
mander of one of Lady Franklin's former searching expediÂ­
tions. Although vegetation was tolerably abundant, and our
two Esquimaux hunters, Mr. Petersen, and several sportsÂ­ i
men constantly on the alert, yet the resources of the country I
during eleven months and a half only yielded us eight reinÂ­ i
deer, two bears, eighteen reals, and a few water fowl and 4
ptarmigan. e
The winter was unusually cold and stormy. Arrangements
were completed during the wtuter for carrying out our in. I
tended plan of search; I felt it to ba my duty personally to I
visit Marshal Island, and in so doing proposed to complete
the circuit of King William Island.
To Lieut. Hohion I allotted the search of the western I
shore of Boothia to the magnetic pole, and from Gateahead
Island westward to Wynniatt's fe'thest. Captain Allen i
Young, our sailing master, was to trace the shore of Prince
of Wales Land, from Lieutenant Browne's furthest; and
also to examine the coast from Bellot Strait northwrrd, to
Sir James Ross'e farthest. l
Early spring journeys were commenced on tho 17th '
February, 1869, by Captain Young and myself, Captain l
Young carrying his depot across to Prince of Wales Land,
whilst I went southward, tovards the magnetic polo, in the l
hope of communicating with the Esquiimaux, and obtaining
such information as might lead us at once to the object of our
search.I
I was accomparied by Mr. Petersen, our interpreter, and l
Alexander Thomson, quartermaster. We had with us two
sledges drawn bydogs. On 28th February, when near Cape
Victoria, we had the good foctune to meet a small party of
natives, and were subsequently visited by at ut forty-five
individuals.
For four days we remained in communication with them
obtaining many relics, and the information that several years I
ago a ship was crushed by the ice off the north shore, off l
King William Island, but that all her people landed safely,
and went away to the Great Fish River, where they died. i
This tribe was well supplied with wood, obtained, they said,
from a boat left by the white men on the greet river.
We reached our vessel after 25 days' absence, in good
health, but somewhat reduced by sharp marching and the
unusually severs weather to which we had been exposed.
For several days after starting the mercury continued frozen.
On 2nd of April our long projected spring journeys were
commenced; Lieut. Robson accompanied me as far as Cape
Victoria; each of ushad a sledge drawn by four men. and an
auxiliary sledge drawn by six dogs. This was all the force
we could mrster.
Before separating we saw two Esquimaux families living
out upon the ice in snow huts; from them we learned that
a second ship had been seon off King William Island, and
that she drifted ashore on the fall of the same year. From
this ship they had obtained a vast deal of wood and iron.
I now gave Lieutenant Hobson directions to search for
the wreck, and follow up any traces he might find upon
King William Island.
Accompanied by my own party and Mr. Petersen, I
marched along the east shore of King William Island, oo
casionaUy passing deserted snow huts, but without meeting
natives till the 8th of May, when off Cape Norton we arrived
atea snow village containing about 30 inhabitants. They
gathered about us without the slightest appearance of fear or
shyness, although none had ever seen living white people
before. They were most w'lling to communicate all their
knowledge; and barter all their goods, but would have stolen
everything had they not been very closely watched. Many
more relics of our countrymen were obtained-we could not
carey away all we might have purchased They pointed to
the inlet we bad crossed the day before, and told us that
one day's march up it, and from thence four days overland,
brought them to the wreck.
None of these people had been there since 1857-8, at
which time they said but little remained, their countrymen
having carried away almost every thing.
Most of our information was received from an intelligent
old woman. She said it wae on the fall of the year that the
ship was forced ashore. Many of the white man dropped by
the way, as they went towards the Great River; but this
was only known to them in the winter following, when their
bodies were discovered. They all assured us that we would
find natives upon the south shore, at the Great River, and
some few at the wreck; but unfortunately this was not the
case. Only one family was met with off Point Booth, and
none at Montreal Island, or any place subsequently visited.
Point Ogle, Montreal Island, and Barrow Island, were
searched without funding anything except a few scraps of
copper and iron in an Esquimaux hiding-place.
Recrossing the Strait to K'ng William Island, we conÂ­
tinued the examination of its southern shore without success
until the 24th of May, when, about ten miles eastward Of
Cape Herschel, a bleached skeleton was found, around which
lay fragments of Erropern clothing. Upon carefully reÂ­
moving the snow a small pocket-book was found containing
a few letters; these, although much decayed, may yet be deÂ­
ciphered. Judging from the remains of his dress this unforÂ­
tunate young man was a steward or officer's servant, and
his position exactly verified the Esquimaux's assertion that
they dropped as they walked along.
On reaching Cape Herschel next day, he examined SimpÂ­
son's Cairn, or rather what remains of it, which is only four
feet high, and the central stones have been removed, as if by
men seeking something within it. My impression at the
time, and which I still retain, is that records were deposited
there by the retreating crews, and subsequently removed by
the natives.
After parting from me at Cape Victoria on the 28th April
Lieutenant Hobson made for Cape Felix; at a short distance
westward of it he found a very large cairn, and close to it
three small tents, with blankets, old clothes, and other relics
of a shooting or a magnetic station; but although the cairn
was dug under, and a trench dug all round it at a distance of
ten feet no record was discovered. A piece of blank paper
folded up waeefound in the cairn, end two broken bottles
which may perhaps have contained records, lay beside it
amongst some stones which had fallen from off the top. The
most interesting of the articles discovered here, including a
boat's ensign, were brought away by Mr. Hobson. About
two miles further to the S.W. a small cairn was found, but
neither records nor relics obtained. About three miles north
of Point Victory a second small cairn was examuned, but
only a broken pickaxe and empty canister found.
On 6th May Lisut. Hobson pitched his tent beside a large
cairn upon Point Victory. Lying amongst Eome loose stones
which had fallen from the top of this cairn was found a emall
tin ease containing a record, the substance of which is briefly
as follows :-This cairn was built by the Franldin ExpediÂ­
tion upon the assumed site of James Ross's pillar, which
had not been found. The Erebus and Terror spent their first
winter at Beechy Island; after having ascended Wellington
Channel to lat. 77 deg. N., and retrrned by the west side of
Cornwallis Islaud. On the 12th September, 1846, they were
beset in lat. 70.05 N., and Ion. 98,23 W.
Sir J. Franklindiedonthe llthJune, 1847. On the 22nd
April, 1848, the ships were abandoned five leagues to the
l N,N.W. of Point Victory, and the survivors, a hundred and




 five in number, la dedhere under the command of Captain
Crozier. This paper was dated 26th April, 1848, and upon the
following day they intended to start for the Great Fish
River. The total loss by deaths in the expedition up to this
date was nine offilera 'and fifteen men. A vast quantity of
clothing and stores of all sorts lay strewed about, as if here
every article was thrown away which could possibly he dieÂ­
pansed with; pickaxes, shovels, boats, cooking utensils, iron
work, rope, blocks, canvas, a dip circle, !a sextant engraved
""Frederic Hornby,"" R.N., a small medicine chebt,
oars, &c.
A few miles southward, across Back Bay, a second record
was found, having been deposited by Lieutenant Gore and
M. des Vooax in May, 1847. It afforded no additional inÂ­
formation.
Lieutenant Hebson continued his search until within a few
days' march of Cape Herschel, without finding any trace of
the wreak or of natives. He left fall information of his imÂ­
portant discoveries for me; therefore, when returning northÂ­
ward by the west shore of King William Island, I had the
advantage of kaowing what had already been found.
Soon after leavsng Cape Herschel the traces of natives
became less numerous and less recent, and after rounding
the west point of the island they ceased altogether. This
shore is extremely low, and almost utterly destitute of vegeÂ­
tation. Numerous banks of shingle and low islets lie off it,
and beyond theee Viotola Strait is covered with heavy and
impenetrable packed ice.
When in lat. 69 deg. 09 N., and long. 99 deg, 27 W., we
came to a large boat, discovered by Lieutenant Hobson a few l
days previously, as his notice informed me. It appeara that
this boat had been intended for the ascent of the Fish
River, but was abandoned apparently upon a return jouuney
to the ships, the sledge upon which she was mounted being
pointed in that direction. She measured 28 feet in length,
by 7i feet wide, was most carefully fitted, and made as light
as possible, but the sledge was of solid ovk, and almost Be
heavy as the boat.
A large quantity of clothing was found within her, also
two humr-o skeleton,. One of these lay in the afrer part of
the boat, under a pile of clothing; the other, which was
much more disturbed, probably by animals, was found in the
bow. Fivepocket watches, a qurnaity of silver spoons and
forks, and a few religious books, were also found, but no
journals, pocket books, or even names upon any article of i
clothing. Two double-barrelled guns stood upi:ght against
the boat's side, precisely as they had been placed eleven years
before. One barrel in each was loaded and c nked; there
was ammunition in abundance, also 30lbs. or 40lbs. of
chocolate, some tea, and tobacco. Fuel was not wanting; a
drift tree lay M :th'Â­ 100 yards of the boat.
Many very interesting relics were brought away by Lieut
Hobson, and aome few by myself. On the 6th June I reached
Point Victory without having forund anything further. The
clothing, &e., was again examined for documents, note-books,
&c., without success, a record placed in the cairn,.and another
buried ten feet true north of it.
Nothing worthy of remark occ'rred upon my return
journey to the ship, which we reached on 19th June, five
days after Lieutenant Hobson.
The shore of King William Island between its north and
west extremes, Capes Felix and Crozier, has not been visite.
by Esquimaux since the abandonment of the Erebus and
Terror, as the cairns and articles lying strewed about, which
are in their eyes of priceless value, remain untouched.
If the wreck still remains visible it is probable she lies upon
some of the off-lying islets to the southward between Capes
Crozier and Herschel.
On 28th June Captain Young and his party returned
having completed their portion of the search, by which the inÂ­
sularity of Prince of Wales Land was determined, and the
coastline intervening between the extreme points reached by
Lieutenants Osborne and Browne discovered; also between
Bellot Strait end Sir James Ross's furthest in 1849, at Four
River Bay.
Fearing that his pro-isions might not last out the requisite
period, Captain Young sent back four of his moo, and for 40
days journeyed on through fogs end gales with bat one man
and the degs, building a snow hut each night ; but few men
could stand so long a continuance of labour and privation, end
its effect upon Captain Young was painfully evident.
Lieutenant Hobson was unable to stand without asaistance
upon his return on board; he was not in good health
when he commenced his long journey, and the sudden severe
exposure brought on a serious attack of scurvy; yet he also
most ably completed his work; and such facts will more
clearly ev'nce the unflinching spirit with which the object of
our voyage has been pursued in these detached duties, than
any praise of mine.
We were now, at length, all on board again. As there
were some slight cases of scurvy, all our treasured resources
of Burton ale, lemon juice, and fresh animal food were put
into requisition, so that in a comparatively short time all
were restored to sound health.
Daring our sojourn in Fort Kennedy we were twice called
upon to follow a shipmate to the grave. Mr. George Brands,
engineer, died of apoplexy, on the 6 th of November, 1858;
he had been out deer-shooting for several hours that day,
and appeared in excellent health.
On the 14th June, 1859, Thomas Blackwell, ship's steward
died of scurvy; this man had served in two of the former'
searching expeditions. The summer proved a warm one;
we were able to start upon our homeward voyage on the 9th of
August, and although the loss ofthe engine-driverin 1867, and
of the engineer in 1888, left us with only two stokers, yet with
their assietanee I was able to control the engines and steam
the ship up to Fury Point.
For six days we lay there closely beset, when a change of
wind removing the ice, our voyage was continued almost
without further interruption, to Godhaven, in Disco, where
we arrivePon the 27th August, and were received with grea
kindness by Mr. Click, inspector of North Greenland, and
the local authorities, who obligingly supplied our few wants.
The two Esquintaux dog drivers were now discharged, and
on the lt September we sailed for England.
From all that can be gleaned from the record paper, end
the evidence afforded by the boat, and various articles of
clothing and equipment discovered, it appears that the abanÂ­
donment of the Erebus end Terror had been deliberately
arranged, and every effort exerted during the third winter to
render the travelling equipments complete.
It is much to be apprehended that disease had greatly reÂ­
ducead the strength of all on board-far more, perhaps, than
they themselves were aware of.
The distance by sledge route from the position of the
ships when abandoned to the boat is 66 geographical miles;
and from the ships to Montreal Island, 220 miles.
The moat perfect order seems to have existed throughout.
In order to extend as much as possible the public utility of
this voyage, magnetical, meteorological, and other observaÂ­
tions, subservient to scientific purposes, and for which inÂ­
struments were supplied through the liberality of the Royal
Society, have been continually and carefully taken, and
every opportunity has been embraced by the surgeon, D.
Walker, M.D., of forming complete collections in all the
various branches of natural history.
This report would be incomplete did I not mention the
obligations I have been laid under to the companions of my
voyage, both officers and men, by their zealous and unvaryÂ­
ing support throughout.
A feeling of entire devotion to the cause which Lady
Franklin has so nobly sustained, end a firm determination
to effect all that men could do, seems to have supported them
through every difficulty. With less of this enthusiastic
spirit, and cheerful obedience to every command, our small
number-23 in all-would net have sufficed for the successful
performance of so great a work.

THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.





SFelloo-citizens of the Senate and House of jt
Representatives-With great gratitude to the c(
bountiful giver of all good I congratulate you r
at the beginning of your first regular session. m
You find our country blessed with -health and I
peace, and abundant harvests, and with enÂ­ w
couraging prospects of an early return of el
s
general prosperity to conplete and make perÂ­ ct
manent. The pacification of the country conÂ­ a]
8
tinues to be, and until it is fully accomplished it
must remain the most important, of all our naÂ­
tional interests. The earnest purpose of good p
citizens generally to unite their efforts in tl
those endeavors is evident. It found decided St
expression in the resolution announced le
in 1876 by the National C'onvention
of the leading political parties of the t'
country. There was a widespread apprehenÂ­ t,
a sion that the momentous results in our progÂ­ n
ress as a nation marked by the recent amendÂ­ a
ment to the Constitu~tion, were in imminent v
i. jeopa;dy; that the good understanding which t(
prompted their adoption in the interest of a a
loyal devotion to the general welfare, might a:
prove a barren truce, and that the sections of n
the country once engaged in civil strife might it
be again almost as widely severed and disunitÂ­ e:
ed as they were when arrayed in arms against a
each other. The course to be pursued which
in my judgment seemed wisest in the presence li
of emergency, was plainly indicated in my inÂ­ a
augural address. It pointed to the time which e
all our people desire to see, when a genuine v
love of our whole country and of all that conÂ­
cerns its true welfare, shall supplant the deÂ­
structive forces of mutual animosity, of races, a
d of sectional hostility. Opinions have differed ,
widely as to the measures best calculated to a:
secure this great end. This was to be exÂ­ ii
pected. The measures adopted by r
the administration have been subjectÂ­ ii
ed to severe and varied criticisms. n
Any course whatever which might have been o
entered upon would certainly have encounÂ­ I
f ter-l, distrust and opposition. These measÂ­ n
ures were, in my judgment, such as were most r
in harmony with the constitution and with the v
genius of our people, and best adapted under a
all the circumstances to attain the end in view. v
d Beneficent results ahleady apparent prove that
* these endeavors are not to be regarded as a
mere experiment, and should sustain and enÂ­ o
courage us in our efforts. Already in the brief c
period which has elapsed the immediate effectÂ­ I
iveness, no less than the justice of the course t
. pursued, is demonstrated, and I have an abidÂ­ e
in g faith that time will furnish its ample vinÂ­ 1,
tt dication in the minds of the great majority of g
my fellow citizens. t
n The discontinuance of the use of the army t,
for the purpose of upholding local governÂ­ a
ments in two States of the Union was no less a
a constitutional duty and requirement v
under the circumstances existing at the time b
than it was a much needed measure for the v
restoration of local self-government and the h
promotion of national harmony. The withÂ­ hI
drawal of the troops from such employment II
was effected deliberately, and with solicitous d
care for the peace and good order of society p
and the protection of property and persons, t]
[l. and every right of all classes of citizens. The ii
iÂ­ results that have followed are indeed signifiÂ­ p
'Y
cant and encouraging. All apprehension of d
danger from remitting those states to local selfÂ­ is
government is dispelled, and a most salutory o.
1I change in the minds of the people has begun n
y and is in progress in every part of that section is
ie
of country, once the theater of G
'a unhappy civil strife, substituting S
' for suspicion, distrust and aversion, v
concord, friendship and patriotic attachment fi
te
to the Union. No unprejudiced mind will it
if deny that the fatal collisions which for several u
I years have been of frequent occurrence, and a
have alarmed the public minds, have almost ri
e entirely ceased; and that a spirit of mutual vn
st forbearance and hearty national interest has n
r succeeded. There has been a general reestabÂ­ ii
ment of order and of the orderly administraÂ­ a
tion of justice. Instances of remaining lawÂ­ ii
lessness have become of rare occurrence; poÂ­ t4
to litical turmoil and turbulence have disapÂ­ b
peared; useful industries have been resumed; f
public credit in the Southern States has been t
greatly strengthened, and the encouraging c
benefits of a revival of commerce between the
sections of the country lately embroiled in y
. civil war are fully enjoyed. Such are some. v
of the results already obtained, upon It
which the country is to be congratulated.
They are of such importance that we


may wltn connaence pauen.uy aWaI ie
~Lu a
sired consummation that will surely come with o
the natural progress of events. 11
he It may not be improper here to say that it a
is should be our fixed and unalterable determinaÂ­ s
tion to protect by all available and proper ii
means under the constitution and the laws, the n
lately emancipated race in the enjoyment of a
their rights and privileges, and I urge upon a
those to whom heretofore the colored people t
have sustained the relation of bondsmen, the d
wisdom and justice of humane and liberal loÂ­ c
0Â­ cal legislation with respect to their education a
id and general welfare. A firm adherence to the t
laws, both national and state, as to the civil g
and political rights of the colored people, .1
now advanced to full equal citizenship, z
and the immediate repression and sure punishÂ­ 1;
ment by the national and local authorities e
within their respective jurisdictions of every c
he instance of lawlessness and violence toward t
is them, is required for the security alike of both c
races, and is justly damanded by the public t
opinion of the country and the age. In this I
way the restoration of harmony and good will, c
and the complete protection of every citizen t
in the full enjoyment of every constitutional t
right, will surely be attained. Whatever i
authority rests with me to this end I shall not
0Â­ hesitate to put forth. Whatever belongs to
s1 the power of Congress and the jurisdiction of E
bÂ­ the Courts of the Union they may confidently I
,rÂ­ be relied upon to provide and perform, and to
the legislatures, the courts and the executive i
authorities of the. several states It




 earnestly appeal to secure by adequate,. ad
appropriate and reasonable means within IV
their borders these common and uniform si]
rights of a united people which love-liberty, wi
abhor oppression and revere justice. These at
objects are very dear to my heart, and I shall re
continue most earnestly to strive for their atÂ­
tainment. The cordial co-operation of all cc
classes, of all sections of the country, and of bE
both races is required for this purpose, and of
with these blessings assured, and not otherÂ­ th
wise, we may safely hope to hand down our Aj
free institution of government unimpaired to 15

the generations that will succeed us. le
FINANOIAL. cc
Among the other subjects of great and 0o
S
general importance to the people of this th
S country, I cannot be mistaken, I think, in reÂ­ cc
garding as pre-eminent the policy and measÂ­ e3
ures which are designed to secure the restoraÂ­ re
tion of the currency to that normal and at
healthful condition in which by the resumpÂ­ re
- tion of specie payments our internal trade and of
foreign commerce inay be brought into harÂ­ to
m'ony with the system of exchanges which is d(
devolved upon the precious metal as the inÂ­ te
trinsic money of the world. In the public 'h,
f
judgment, that this end should be sought and w
e compassed as speedily and as securely as the bh
resources of the people and the wisdom of of
the Government can accomplish, there is a a
much, greater degree of unanimity than is le
found to concur in the specific measures cc
rÂ­
which will bring the country to this desired Si
if end, or the rapidity of the steps by which it t1
can be safely reached. Upon a most anxious it:
and deliberate examination, which I have felt vo
d it my duty to give to the subject, I am but the w
more confirmed in the opinion which I exÂ­
pressed in accepting the nomination for the 1P
d Presidency, and again upon my inauguration,
`
n
that the policy of resumption should be purÂ­ fa
d sued by every suitable means, and that no cm
d legislation would be wise that should disparage 1!
n the importance or retard the attainment of ci
that result? I have no disposition, and cerÂ­ o0
e tainly no right, to question the sincerity or inÂ­ it
- tegrity of opposing opinions; and would p
neither conceal nor undervalue the considerÂ­
1Â­ able difficulties and even occasional distresses
a
it which may attend the progress of the nation o1
h toward this primary condition, to its general jr
and permanent prosperity. I must, however, p
adhere to my most earnest conviction, that tc
it
any wavering in purpose or unsteadi-. o:
if ness in methods, so far from avoidÂ­ n
it
ing or reducing the inconveniÂ­
tÂ­
ence inseparable from the transition from U
t an irredeemable to a redeemable paper curÂ­ i<
h rency, would only tend to increased and proÂ­ ti
longed disturbance in values, and unless reÂ­ c,
:e
lieved must end in serious disorder, dishonor li
1Â­
and disaster in the financial affairs of *the govÂ­ tc
Ii ernment and of the people. The mischiefs it
ic which I apprehended and urgently deprecate, b
are confined to no class of the people, indeed,
n
but seem to me most certainly to threaten the c,
industrious masses, whether their occupations ci
are of skilled or common labor. To them it
a:
seems tO me itis of importance that their labor p
to
should be compensated in money which is in I
i. itself fixed in exchangeable value by being irÂ­ ri
iy
revocably measured by the labor necessary to ti
tÂ­ its production. The permanent quality of the a
s. money of the people is sought for and can
n only be gained by the resumption of specie t]
aÂ­ payment. The rich, the speculative, the a
sÂ­ money-dealing classes, may not always feel the f,
st mischiefs of, or may find casual profits in a a
ic
variable currency; but the misfortunes of such fi
er
a currency to those who are paid salaries or a
v. wages are remediless. d
it COINAGE. O
a Closely connected with this general subject a
aÂ­
of the resumption of specie payments is one o
ef
of subordinate but still of grave importance, v
tÂ­ I mean the readjustment of our coinage sysÂ­ o
se tem. By the renewal of the silver dollar as an o
3Â­
element in our specie currency, endowed by ti
nÂ­
legislation with the quality of legal tender to a ii
of
greater or less extent. As there is no doubt of c
the power of Congress under the constitution t]
iy to coin money and regulate the value thereof, a
aÂ­ and as this power covers the whole range of te
ss
authority applicable to the metal, the rated c:
at
value, and the legal tender quality which shall i1
ie
be adopted for the coinage, the considerations ci
ie
which should induce or discourage a particuÂ­ fi
ie lar measure connected withll the coinage beÂ­ d
iÂ­
long clearly to the province of legisÂ­ d
at
lative discretion and of public expeÂ­ ti
is
diency. Without intruding upon this si
y province of legislation in the least, I have yet si
s, thought the subjectof such critical importance I
e in the actual condition of our affairs as to t1
iÂ­
present an occasion for the exercise of the o:
)f
duty hiposed by the Constitution on the PresÂ­ v
fÂ­
ideAnt. of ImrnlnmeirliTlnr to tllp annarlo r~nf


y of Congress such measures as he shall judge
n necessary and expedient. Holding the opinÂ­ n
*n
ion, as I do, that neither the interests of the ci
)f
Government nor of the people of the United lE
g States would be promoted by disparaging silÂ­ a
r,
ver as one of the two precious metals which o:
it furnish the coinage of the world, and that g
11
legislation which looks to maintaining the volÂ­ b
l ume of intrinsic money to as full .
da measure of both metals as their n
st
relative commercial values will permit, a
al
would be neither unjust nor inexpedient, I sj
is must ask your indulgence to a brief and defÂ­ c:
3Â­
inite statement of certain essential features in d
iÂ­ any such legislative measure which I feel t
vÂ­
it my duty to recommend. I do not propose ti
)Â­
to enter the debate represented on both sides k
pÂ­
by such able disputants in Congress and beÂ­ b
d;
fore the people and ini the press, as to the exÂ­ r,
n tent to which the legislation of any one nation n
ig
can control this question. Even within its tj
ie own borders, against the laws of trade or the a
in
positive .laws of other governments, the e:
te.
wisdom of Congress in shaping any particular
a
>n
law that may be presented for my approval t]
d.
may wholly supersede the nr -essity of my enÂ­ e
rc
tering into these considerations, and willingly g
aÂ­
avoid either vague or intricate inquiries. It is sj
bh only certain plain and practical traits of such o
legislation that I desire to recommend to your n
it attention. In any legislation providing for a li
aÂ­
silver coinage, regulating its value and impartÂ­ ih
ar
ing to it the quality of legal tender, it seems to a
ie
me that Congressshould not lose sight of its e:
of
action as operating in a two-fold capacity
in
and two distinct directions. If the United
le States Government were free from a public c
le
debt its legislative dealin'g with the question n
oÂ­ of silver coinage would be purely sovereign e'
m
and governmental, under no restraint but o
ie
those of the constitutional power, the public n
ril
good as affected by the proposed legislation,
g
e, but in the actual circumstances of the nation, e
p,
with a vast public debt distributed very wideÂ­ fi
hÂ­
ly among our own citizens and -held in great ii
es amlounts also abroad, the nature of the silver a
ry coinage measure as affecting this relation of c
rd
the government to the holders of the public
th
debt becomes, in any proposed legislation, of b
Lic
the highest concern. The obligation of the a
Lis
public faith transcends all questions of profit t:
11,
or public advantage otherwise. Its .unquesÂ­
an
tionable 'maintenance is the dictate as well as 1,
Lal the highest expediency as of the most
er necessary duty, and will be 'carefully
u
ot guarded by Congress and the people ,
to alike. The public debt of the United j
of States to the amount of .$729,000,000 bears t'
ly interest at the rate of six per cent., and $708,Â­ '
to 000,000 at the rate of 5 per cent., and the only '
ve
way in which the country can be relieved from (
I the payment of the high rates of interest is by t


advantageously refunding the indebtedness.
Whether the debt is ultimately paid in gold or
silver coin is of but little moment compared
with the possible reduction of interest to the
amount of one third by refunding it at such
reduced rate. If the United States had the uiÂ­
questionable right to pay its bonds in silver
coin the little benefit from that process would
be greatly overbalanced by the injurious effect.
of such payment if made or proposed against
the honest convictions of the public creditors.
All the bonds that have been issued since Feb,
12, 1873, when gold became the only unlimited
legal tender metallic currency of the
country, are justly payable in gold coin
or in coin of equal value. During
the time of these issues the only dollar that
could be or was received by the government in .
exchange for bonds was the gold dollar. To
require the public creditors to take in payment
any dollar of less commercial value would be
regarded by them as a repudiation of the full
obligation assumed. The bonds issued prior
to 1873 were issued at a time when the gold
dollar was the only coin in circulation or conÂ­
templated by either the government or the
,
'holders of the bonds, as the coin in which they'
were to be paid. It is far better to pay these.
bonds in coin than to seem to take advantage
of the unforseen fall of silver bullion, to pay in
a new issue of silver coin that made so much
less valuable the power of the United States'to
coin money and to regulate the value thereof. :
Such a power ought never to be exercised for
the purpose of enabling the government to pay
its obligations in a coin of less
value than that contemplated by the parties
when the bonds were issued. Any attempt'to
pay the national indebtedness in coinage 'of
less commercial value than the money of the.
.
world would involve a violation of the public.
faith and work irreparable injury to the public
credit. It was the great merit of the act of
March, 1869, in strengthening the public
credit that removed all doubt as to the purpose
of the United States to pay their bonded debt
in coin. That act was accepted as a pledge of. .
public faith. The government has derived
great benefit from it in the progress thus far
made in refunding the public debt at lowrate .
of interest. An adherence to the wise and
just policy of, or the exact observance of,. the
public faith will enable the government rapidly
to reduce the burden of 'interest
of the national debt to an amount/
not exceeding $20,000,000 per anÂ­
num and effect an aggregate saving to the
United States of more than $300,000,000 beÂ­
fore the bonds can be fully paid. In adopting
the new silver coinage to the ordinary uses of
currency, in the every day transactions of
life,and preserving the quality of legal tender,
to be assigned to it a consideration of the first
importance, should be so to adjust the rites
between the silver and the gold coinage which
now constitutes our specie currency as to acÂ­
complish the desired end of maintaining the
circulation of the the two metallic currencies
and keeping up theavolume of the two:
precious metals as our intrinsic' money.
It is a mixed question for scientific
reasoning and historical experience to de-.
termine how far and by what methods
a practicable equilibrium can be maintained'
which will keep both metals in circulation in
their appropriate spheres of common use. A.i
absolute equality ofÂ­ commercial value,' free
from disturbing fluctuations, is hardly attainÂ­
able, and without it an unlimited legal-tender
1
for private transactions assigned to both metÂ­
.
als would tend to drive out of circulation the
dearest coinage, and disappoint the principal
object proposed by the legislation in view. I
t
apprehend, therefore, that the two conditions

of a near approach to equality of commercial

that every possible increase should be given to

are desired from the proposed coinage, and

embarrass with new elements of confusion

and uncertainty the business of the country,
that I urge upon your attention these' considÂ­

1 lic debt, heretofore issued and now outstand-..

ent gold coinage of the country.
cIVIL SERVICE.
1
The organization of the civil service of the
country has for a number of years attracted
more and more of public attention. So genÂ­
eral has become the opinioni that the methods:
t of admission to it, and the condition of reÂ­
maining in it, are unsound, that both of the
great political parties have agreed on the most.
explicit declarations of the necessity of reÂ­
form, and in the most emphatic demands for .
t it. I have fully considered the declarations:
r and demands to be the expressions of sincere,,i
f convictions of the intelligent masses of the :
c
people upon the subject, and that they should
f be recognized and followed by earnest.
B and prompt action on the part of the legisla:i
t tive and executive departments of the govern:
ment. In.pursuance of the purpose indicated.::.
s before my accession to office, I endeavored' to
have my own views distinctly understood,. andur.i:t
I
Y upon my inauguration my accord with the:i:rs
e .public opinion was stated in terms believed to
be plain and unambiguous. My experience in
5.the executive duties has strongly confirmed
-the belief in the great advantage the country
Y w ould find in observing strictly the planei of: the
a Constitution which imposes upon the' execuÂ­
Y
tive the sole duty and responsibility :of the

selection of those federal officers who by law
are appointed, not elected, and which in like
manner assigns to the Senate the complete
right to advise and consent to or to reject the
nominations so made, whilst the House of
representatives stands as the public censor of
the performance of official duties, with the
'prerogative of investigation and providing
for punishment in all cases of dereliction.
The blemishes and imperfections in the civil
service may, as I think, be traced in most
eases to a practical confusion of the duties asÂ­
signed to the several departments of the govÂ­
ernment. My purpose in this respect has
been to return to the system established by the
fundamental law, and to. do this with the
heartiest cooperation and most cordial underÂ­
standing with the Senate and House of RepreÂ­
sentatives. The political difficulties in the seÂ­
lection of numerous officers for posts of widely
varying responsibilities and duties are acknowlÂ­
edged to be very great. No system can be exÂ­
pected to secure absolute freedom from mistakes
and the beginning of any attempted change
of custom is quite likely to be more emparÂ­
rassed in this respect than any subsequent
period. It is here that the constitution seems
to most prove of its claim to be the great
wisdom accorded to it gives the Executive the
assistance of the knowledge and experienc
of the Senate, which, when acting upon nomiÂ­
nations as to which they may be disinterested
and impartial judges, secures as strong a
guarantee of freedom of errors of importance
as is perhaps possible in human affairs. In
addition to this, I recognize the public adÂ­
vantage of making all nominations as nearly
as possible in person. In the sense of being
free from mere caprice or favor
in these directions, and in those offices
-which special training is of greatly increased
value, I believe such a rule as to the tenure of
office should obtain as may induce men of
proper qualifications to apply themselves inÂ­
distriously to the task of becoming proficients.
Bearing these things in mind, I have endeavÂ­
ored to reduce the number of changes in subÂ­
ordinate places usually made upon the change
of the general administration, and shall most
heartily co-operate with Congress in the best
systematizing of such methods and rules of
admission to the public service, and ofypromoÂ­
tion within it as may promise to be nmst sucÂ­
cessful, in making thorough competency, effiÂ­
ciency and character the decisive tests in these
matters..
I ask the renewed attention of Congress to
what has already been done by the civil serÂ­
vice commission appointed in pursuance of act
of Congress by my predecessor to prepare and
revise the civil service rules. In regard to
much of the departmental service, especially
at Washington, it may be difficult to organize
a better system than that which has thus been
provided, and it is now b'eing used to a considÂ­
erable extent, under my direction. The ComÂ­
mission has still a legal existence, althoughfor
several years no appropriation has been made
for defraying its expenses. Believing that this
commission has rendered valuable service, and
will be a most universal agency in improving
the administration of the civil service,
I respectfully recommend that a
suitable appropriation to be immediately made
to enable it to continue its service. It is my
purpose to transmit to Congress as early as
practicable, a report by the Chairman of the
Commission, and to ask your attention to such
measures upon this4subject as in my opinion
will further promote the improvement of the
civil service.
FOREIGN RELATIONS.
' During the past year the United States have conÂ­
tinued to maintain peaceful relations with foreign
powers. The outbreak of war between Russia and
Turkey, though at one time attended by grave apÂ­
prehensions as to its effect upon other European
nations, has had no tendency to disturb the amicaÂ­
ble relations existing between the United States and
each of the contending powers. An attitude of just
and impartial neutrality has been preserved, and I
am gratified to state that in the midst of their hostiliÂ­
ties both the Russian and the Turkish Governments 1
have shown an earnest desire to adhere to the obliÂ­ I
gations of all treaties with the United States and
give due regard to the rights of American citizens.
By the terms of the treaty defining the rights, imÂ­
.munities and privileges of consuls between Italy'
and the United States, ratified in 1868, either governÂ­
ment may after the lapse of ten years terminate the
existence of the treaty by giving twelve months' noÂ­
tice of its intention. The government of Italy, availÂ­
ing itself of this, has now given the required notice.
The treaty will accordingly end on the 15th of SepÂ­
tember, 1878. It. is understood, however, that the
Italian government wishes to renew in its general
scope, desiring only certain modifications in some of
its al-ticles. h this disposition I concur, and shall
hope that no serious obstacles may intervene to preÂ­
vent or delay the negotiaion of a satisfactory treaty.
Numerous questions in regard to passports, naturÂ­
alization and.exemption from military service, have
continued to arise in cases of emigrants from GerÂ­
many, who have returned to their native country.
The provisions of the treaty of February 22, 1868,
however, have proved to be so ample and so judiÂ­
cious that the legation of the United States at Berlin


bhas been able to adjust all claims arising under it,
not only without detriment to the amicable relations
existing between the two governments, but it is beÂ­
lieved without injury or injustice duly naturalized
American citizen. It is desirable that the treaty
originally made with the North-German Union in
1867 should now be extended so as to apply equally
to all the States of the Empire of Germany.
The institution of the government of France to
participate in the exposition of the products of agriÂ­
culture, industry and the fine arts, to be held at Paris
during the coming year, was submitted for your conÂ­
sideration at the extra session. It is not doubted
that its acceptance by the United States, and a wellÂ­
selected exhibition of the products of American inÂ­
dustry on that occasion, will tend to stimulate interÂ­
national commerce and immnigration, as well as to
promote friendship between the two countriest
A question arose some time since as to the proper
meaning of the extraditing articles of the treaty of
1843 between the United States and Great Britain.
Both governments, however, are now in accord in
the belief that the question is not one that should be
allowed to frustrate the ends of justice or to disturb.
the friendship between the two nations. No serious
difficulty has arisen in accomplishing the extradition
of criminals when necessary. It is probable that the
points of disagreement will in due time be settled,
and if need be. more explicit declarations be made in
a new treaty. The Fishery Commission under artiÂ­
cles 28 and 30, of the Treaty of Washington,
has concluded its session. The result of
the deliberations of the Commission as made public
by the Commissioners, will be communicated to
Congress, A treaty for the protection of tradeÂ­
anarks has been negotiated with Great Britain, which
has been submitted to the Senate for consideration.
The revolution which recently occurred in Mexico
was followed by the accession of the successful parÂ­
ty to power and the installation of its chief ganeral,
Poriirio Diaz, in the Presidentialoilce. It has been
the custom of the United States wheni such changes
of government have heretofore occurred in Mexico
to recognize and enter into offilcial relations with the
â€¢defacto government as soon as it should appear
to have the approval of the MIexican people
and should manifest a disposition to adhere to
the obligations of treaties and international
friendship. In the present case such official recogÂ­
nition has been deferred by the occurrences on the
Rio Grande border, the records of which have alÂ­
ready been communicated to each House of ConÂ­
gress in answer to their respective resolutions of inÂ­
qluiry. Assurances have been received that the auÂ­
thorities at the seat of the Mexican government have
both the disposition and the power to prevent and
punish such unlawful invasions and depredations.
It is earnestly to be hoped that events may prove
these assurances to be well founded. The best inÂ­
terests of both countries require the maintenance
of peace upon the border, and the development of
commerce between the two Republics. It is gratifyÂ­
ing to add that this temporary interruptioni of oillcial
relations has not prevented duie attention
by the representatives of the United
States in Mexico to the protection of
American citizens so far as practicable; nor has it
interfered with the prompt payment of the amounts
due from Mexico to the United States under the
treaty of July 4, 1868, and the awards of the Joint
Commission. While I do not anticipate an InterrupÂ­
tion of the friendly relations with Mexico. yet I canÂ­
not but look with some solicitude on a continuance
of the brder disorders as exposing the two countries
to initiations of popular feeling and mischances of
-action, which are naturally unfavorable to complete
amity. Firmly determined that nothing shall be
wanting on their part to promote a good understandÂ­
ing between the two nations, I yet must ask the
attention of Congress to the actual occurrences on
-the border, that-the lives and property of our citizens
may be adequately protected and peace preserved.
Another year has passed without bringing 'to a
close the protracted contest between the Spanish
government and tihe insurrection in the island of
Cuba. While the United States have sedulously
abstained from any intervention in this controversy.
it is impossible not to feel that it is attended by inÂ­
cidents affecting the rights of American citizens
apart from the effect of the hostilities upon the trade
between the United States anud Cuba. Their progÂ­
ress is inevitably accompanied by complaints,
having more or less foundation, of searches, arrests,
embargoes and oppressive taxes upon the property
of American residents and of unprovoked
interference with American vessels and comÂ­
Inerce. It is due to the government of Spain
to say that during the past year it has promptly disÂ­

 avowed and offered reparation for any unauthorized
acts of zealous subordinates whenever Such acts have
been brought to its attention. Nevertheless such ocÂ­
currences cannot but tend to excite feelings of anÂ­
noyance, suspicion and resentment, which are greatÂ­
ly tobe deprecated, between the respective subjects
and citizens of two friendly powers.
Much delay consequent on the occasions of fraud
in some of the awards has occurred in respect to the
distribution of the limited amounts received from
Venezuela under the treaty of April 25, 1866,applicable
to the awards of the joint commissioners created by
that treaty. So long as these matters are pending
in Congress the Executive cannot assume either to
pass upon the questions presented or to distribute
the fund received. It is eminently desirable that
definite legislative action should be taken either deÂ­
ciding the awards to be final or providing some
method for examination of the claims. Our relations
with the Republics of Central and South America
and with the Empire of Brazil have continued withÂ­
out serious change further than the temporary interÂ­
ruption of diplomatic intercourse with Venezuela and
with Guatemala. Amicable relations have already
been fully restored with Venezuela, and it is not
doubted that all grounds of misundersttznding with
Guatemala will speedily be removed. From all these
countries there are favorable indications of a disÂ­
position on the part of their governments and people
to reciprocate our efforts in the direction of increased
commercial intercourse.
The government of the Samoan Islands has sent
an envoy in the person of its Secretary of State to
invite the government of the United States to advise
and protect their independence, to establish comÂ­
mercial relations with their people and to assist them
in their steps towards responsible and regular govÂ­
ernment. The inhabitants of these Islands having
made considerable progress in Christian civilization'
and in the development of trade are doubtful of their
ability to maintain peace and independence without
the aid of some stronger power. The subject is
deemed worthy of respectful attention and the
claims upon our assistance by this independent conmÂ­
munity will be carefully considered.
BUSINESS DEPRESSION.
The long commercial depression in the United
States has directed attention to the subject of the
possible increase of our foreign trade and the methÂ­
ods for its development, not only with Europe but
with other countries, and especially with the states
and sovereignties of the Western Hemisphere. InÂ­
structions from the Department of State were isÂ­
sued to the various diplomatic and consular olfices
of the Government, asking them to devote attention
to the question of methods by which trade between
the respective countries of their official residences
and the United States could be most judiciously
founded. In obedience to the instructions, exÂ­
aminations and reports upon this subject have been
made by many of these officers and transmitted to
thb Department, and the same are submitted to the
cohsideration of Congress.
FINANCIAL.
The annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury
presents important questions for the action of ConÂ­
gress, upon some of which I have already remarked.
The revenues of the government during the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1877, were $269,000,5b6.6'2. The
total expenditures for the same period were $23S,Â­
660,00S.93, leaving a surplus revenue of $30,340,577.69.
This has substantially supplied the requirements of
the sinking fund for that year. The estimated reveÂ­
nues of the current fiscal year are $2i5,500,000, and
the estimated expenditures for the same period are
$232,430,643.72. If these estimates prove to be
correct there will be a surplus revenue of $33,Â­
069,856.28, an amount nearly sufficient for
the sinking fund for that year. The
estimated revenues for the next fiscal year are
$269,250,000. It appears from the report that during
the last fiscal year the revenues of the government
compared with the previous year, have largely deÂ­
creased. This decrease, amounting to the sunm of
$18,481,452.54, was mainly in customs duties caused
partly by a large falling off of the amount of imÂ­
ported dutiable goods and partly by the general fall
of prices in the markets of the productions of such
articles as pay ad valorem taxes. While this is felt
injurious it has been accompanied with a
very large increase of exportations. Tne total
'exports during the last fiscal year, including coin,
has been $658,637,457 and the imports have been $192,Â­
097,540, leaving a balance of trade in favor of the
United, States amounting to the sum of $166,539,917,
the beneficial effects of which extend to all branches
of business. The estimated revenue for the next
fiscal year will impose upon Congress the duty of
strictly limiting the appropriations, including the
requisite sum for the maintenance of the sinking
fund, within the aggregate estimate of receipts.
While the aggregate of taxes should not be increased
amendments might be made to the revenue laws
that would without diminishing the revenue
relieve the people from unnecessary burdens.
A tax on tea and coffee is shown by the experience
not only of our own country but of other countries
to ibe easily collected without loss by undervaluation
or fraud and largely borne in the country of producÂ­
tion. A tax of 10 cents per pound on tea and two
cents per pound on colffee would produce a revenue
exceeding $12,000,000, and thus enable Congress to
repeal a multitude of annoying taxes yielding a revÂ­
enue not exceed!ng that sum. The internal revenue
system grew out of the necessities of the war, and
most of the legislation imposing taxes upon domesÂ­
tic products under this system has been repealed.
By the substitution of a tax on tea and coffee all
forms of internal taxation may be repealed, except
that on whisky, spirits, tobacco and beer.
REVENUE LAWS.
Attention is also called to the necessity of enacting
more vigorous laws for the protection of the revenue
and for the punishment of frauds and smuggling.
This can be best done by judicious provisions that
will induce the disclosure of attempted fraud by unÂ­
dervaluation and smuggling. All revenue laws
should be simple in their provisions and easily unÂ­
derstood. So far as practicable the rates of taxation
should be in the form of specific duties and not adÂ­
valorem, requiring the judgment of experienced
men to ascertain values and exposing the revenue to
the temptation of fraud. IMy attention has been
called during the recess of Congress to the abuses
in connection with the customs, and strenuous efforts
have been made for their correction by executive
orders. The recommendations submitted to the SecÂ­
retary of the Treasury by a commission appointed to
examine into the collection of customs duties at the
port of New York contain many suggestions for the
mnodification of the customs laws to which the attenÂ­
tion of Congress is invited.


It is a matter of congratulation that notwiths tandÂ­
ing the severe burdens caused by the war the public
faith with all creditors has been preserved, and as
the result of this policy the public credif has continÂ­
uously advanced and our public securities are reÂ­
garded with the highest favor in the markets of the
world. I trust that no act of the government will
cast a shadow upon its credit. The progress of reÂ­
funding the public debt has been rapid and satisfacÂ­
tory.
SUBSCRIPTION TO BONDS.
Under the contract existing when I entered upon
the discharge of the duties of my office the bonds
bearing interest at the rate of 4;! per cent. were beÂ­
ing rapidly sold and within three months the aggreÂ­
gate sales of these bonds had reached the sum of
$2L0,000,000. With my sanction the Secretary of the
Treasury entered into a new contract for the sale of
4 per cent bonds, and within 30 days after the popuÂ­
lar subscription for such bonds was opened. subÂ­
scriptions Were had amounting to $75,496,550, which
were paid for within 90 days after the date of the
subscription. By this process within but little more
than one year the annual interest on the public debt
was reduced in the sum of $3,775,000.
SAVINGS.
I recommend that suitable provision be made to
enable the people to easily convert their savings into
government securities, as the best mode in which
small savings may be well secured and yield a modÂ­
erate interest. It is an object of public policy to reÂ­
tain among our own people the securities of the
United States. In this way our country is guarded
against their sudden return from foreign countries,
caused by war or other disturbance beyond our conÂ­
trol.
INTERNATIONAL TRADE.
The commerce of the United States with foreign
nations and especially in the export of domestic
productions, has of late years largely increased, but
the greater portion of this trade is conducted
in foreign vessels. The importance of
enlarging our foreign trade and especially by diÂ­
rect and speedy interchange with the countries on
this continent, cannot be overestimated, and it is a
matter of great moment that our shipping interest
should receive, to the utmost practical extent, the
bonefit of our commerce with other lands. These
considerations are forcibly urged by all the large
commercial cities of the country, and public attenÂ­
tion is generally and wisely attracted to the solution
of the problems they present. It is not doubted that
Congress will take them up in the broadest spirit of
liberality and respond to the public demand by pracÂ­
ticable legislation upon this subject.
THE ARMIY.
The report of the Secretary of War shows that the
army has been actively employed during the
year, and has rendered very important service in
repressing hostilities in the Indian country, and
preserving peace and, proteeting life and property in
the interior, as well as along the Mlexican border.
A long and arduous campaign has been prosecuted
with tinal complete success against a portion of the
NezPerces tribe of Indians. A full account of this
campaign will be found in the report of the General
of the Army. It will be seen that in its course several
battles were fought, in which a number of gallant
oillcers and men lost their lives. I join with the SecÂ­
retary of War and the General of the Army in
awarding to the ofillcers and umen employed in the
long and toilsome pursuit, and in the final
capture of these Indians, the honor and praise which
is so justly their due.
TRADE TROUBLES.
The very serious riots which occurred in several
of the states in July last rendered necessary the emÂ­
ployment of a considerable portion of the army to
preserve peace and maintain order in the states of
West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Illinois.
These disturbances were so formidable as to defy
the local and state authorities, and the National exeÂ­
cutive.was called upon in the mode provided by the
Constitution and laws to furnish military, and I am
grateful to he able to state that the troops sent in reÂ­
sponse to these calls for aid in suppression of domesÂ­
tic violence, were able by the influence of their presÂ­
ence in the disturbed regions to preserve the peace
and restore order without the use of force. In the
discharge of this delicate and important duty both
officers and men acted with great prudence and
courage, and for their services deserve the thanks
of their country.
THE MEXICAN TROUBLES.
Disturbances along the Rio Grande in Texas, to
which I have already referred, have rendered necesÂ­
sary the coustant employment of a military force in
that vicinity. A full report of all recent military

 operations in that quarter has been transmitted to I1
the House of Representatives in answer to a resoluÂ­ fi
tion of that body, and it will not therefore be necesÂ­ fi
sary to enter into details. I regret to say that these tl
lawless incursions into our territory by armed bands s1
from the Mexican side of the line, for the purpose of p
robbery, have been of frequent occurrence, and in c
spite of the most vigorous efforts of the commander d
of our forces, the marauders have generally sucÂ­
ceeded in escaping into Mexico with their plunder.
In May last I gave orders for the exercise of .the utÂ­ si
most vigilance on the part of our troops c
for the suppression of these raids and the d
punishment of the guilty parties, as well as the reÂ­ n
capture of property stolen by:them. Gen. Ord, comÂ­ d
manding in Texas. was directed to invite the cooperÂ­ o
ation of the Mexican authorities in efforts to this t1
end, and assure ithem that I was anxious to avoid ti
giving the least offense to Mexico; at the sameltime ii
he was directed to give notice of my determination
to put an end to the invasion of our territory by lawÂ­
less bands, intent on the plunder of our peaceful c
citizens, even if the effectual punishment of the outÂ­ o
laws should make the crossing of the border by our ti
troops in their pursuit necessary. It is believed that X
this policy has had the effect to check somewhat ti
these depredations, and that with a considerable inÂ­ h
crease of our force upon that frontier, and the estabÂ­ t
lishment of several additional military posts along v
the Rio Grande, so as more effectually to guard that '1
extensive border, peace may be preserved and the t
lives and property of citizens in Texas be fully proÂ­ b
tected. ti
THE ARMY. p
Prior to the first day of July last the army was, in a
acdordance with law, reduced to the maximum of e
25,000 enlisted men, being a reduction of 2500 below o
the force previously authorized. This reduction was ii
made as required by law, entirely from the infantry c
and artillery branches of the service, without any reÂ­ v
duction of the cavalry. Under the law as it now a
stands, it is necessary that the Cavalry regiments be r
recruited to 100 men in each company for service on n
the Mexican and Indian frontiers. The necessary o
effect of this legislation is to reduce the infantry and n
artillery arms of the service below the number reÂ­
quired for efficiency, and I concur with the SecreÂ­
tary of War in recommending that authority be given o
to recruit all companies of infantry to at least lifty ii
men, and all batteries of artillery to at least seventyÂ­ i
five men, with power in case of emergency to inÂ­ p
crease the former to 100 and the latter to 125 men a
each. .
I invite your special attention to the following recÂ­ v
dmmendations of the Secretary of War: First, that t
provision be made for supplying to the army a more
abundant and better supply of leading matter.
Second, that early action be taken by Congress lookÂ­ t
ing to a complete revision and republication of the t:
army regulations. Third, that section 1258, of the o
Revised Statutes limiting the number of oflicers on t
the retired list be repealed. Fourth, that the claims a
arising under act of July 4, 1864, for supplies, taken h
by the army during the war, be taken from the offices t
of the Quartermaster and Commissary Generals, and v
transferred to the Southern Claims Commission, or i
some other tribunal having more time and better faÂ­ i
cilities for their prompt investigation and decision d
than are possessed by these olllcers. Fifth, that ConÂ­ t
gress provide for an annuity fund for the families of n
deceased soldiers, as recommended by the PaymlasÂ­ e
ter General of the army. r
THE NAVY.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy shows i
that we have six squadrons now engaged in the proÂ­ o
tection of our foreign commerce and other duties t,
pertaining to the naval service. The condition and e
operations of the department are also shown. The C
total expenditures for the fiscal year ending June 30, ih
1877, were $16,0T7,974.54. There are unpaid claims n
against the department chargeable to the last year lI
which are presented to the consisderation of Con-. i
gress. By the report of the Secretary the estimates I
for the liscal year commencing July 1, 1878, are o
16,233,234.40, exclusive of the sum of 231,443.11 subÂ­ e
mitted for new building, repairs and improvements f1
at tile several navy yards. The appropriations for p
present fiscal year commencing July, 1577, are n
$13,592,932.90. The amount drawn from the treasury e
from July 1 to November 1, 1877, is $3,343,037.40, of d
which there is estimated to be yet available $1,029,Â­ o
523 30, showing the amount of actual expenditure it
during the first four months of the present liscal year i
to have been $4,313,509.10. b
THE 1'OSTOFFICE DEPART3IENT. t
The report of the Postmaster General contains a a
full and clear statement of the operations and conÂ­ t;
dition of the Postollice Department. The ordinary it
revenues of the department for the fiscal year endÂ­ C
ing June 30, 1577, including receipts from the money o
order business and from olticial stamps and stamped "",
envelopes amounted to to the sum of $27,531,085.26. The
\
additional sum of $7,013,000 was received from apÂ­ c
propriation from the general treasury for various 1
purposes, making the receipts from all sources $34,Â­ 13

The ordinlary revenue of the Postoffice Department I
for the year ending Juhe 30, 1879. are estimated at an si
increase of three per cent over those of 1877, making tl
$29,034,098.28, and the expenditures for the same t1
year are estimated at $36,427,771, leaving an estimated ,
deliciency for 1179 of $7,393,392.02. The addlitional p
legislation recommended by the Postmaster General f,
for improvements of the mail service and to protect
the postal revenue from the abuses practicedl under a
existing laws is respectfully commended to the careÂ­ c
ful consideration of Congress. h
DEPAIRTMENT OF JUSTICE. n
The report of the Attorney General contains sevÂ­ e
eral suggestions as to the administration of justice tl
to whica I invite attention. The pressure of busiÂ­ t
ness in the Supreme Court and mn certain circuit e
courts of the United States is now such that serious g
delays to the great injury anti even oppression of suitÂ­ (
ors occur, and a remedy should bie sought for. This o
condition of alf'irs, whether it will be found in the s
nhltn r'iiflv nl(tcllpd in ;lie l'lrenrt. of inr:l'nngino the


number of jutges of Circuit Courts, and by means p
of this addition to the judicial force of creating an
intermediate Court of Errors and Appeals, or s
whether some other mode can be devised for obviatÂ­
ing the difficulties which now exist, I leave to your tl
mature consideration.
TIIE INDIANS.
The present condition of the Indian tribes on the
Territory of the United States, and our relations with g
them, are fully set forth In the reports of the SecreÂ­
tary of the Interior and the Comniissioner of Indian i
Affairs. After a series of the most deplorable conÂ­
flicts, the successful termination of which while reÂ­
electing honor on the brave soldiers who accomÂ­ t
plished it, cannot lessen our regret at the occurrence. e
We are now at peace with all the Indian tribes in our 1
borders. To preserve that peace by a just and lhuÂ­ o
mane policy will be the object of my earnest endeavÂ­ t
ors. Whatever may be said of their character and ,
savage propensity, of the difficulties of introducing r
among them the habits of civilized life, and the obÂ­ t
stacles they have offered to the progress of settling t
in certain parts the country, the IndlÂ­ s
ans are certainly entitled to our sympathy B
and to a conscientious respect on our part for their e
claims upon our sense of justice. They were the ,
aboriginal occupants of the land we now possess; c
they have been driven from place to place; the purÂ­ c
chase money paid to them in some cases for what c
they called their own has still left them poor; in f
many instances when they had settled down upon
land assigned to them by compact, and begun to supÂ­
port themselves by their own labor, they were rudely
jostled off and thrust into the wilderness again.
Many, if not most all, our Indian wars have had i
their origin in broken promises and acts of injustice
on our part, and the advance of Indians in civilizaÂ­
tion has been slow because the treatment they reÂ­
ceived did not permit it to be faster and more genÂ­
eral. We cannot expect them to improve and
follow our guidance unless we keep faith with
them in respecting the rights they possess; and unÂ­
less, instead of depriving them of their opportunities,
we lend them a helping hand. I cordially approve
the policy regarding the management of Indian afÂ­
fairs outlined in the reports of the Secretary of the
Interior, and of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs.
The faithful performance of our promises is the first
condition of a good understanding with the Indians.
I cannot too urgently recommend to Congress that
prompt and liberal provision be made for the conÂ­
scientious fulfillment of all agreements entered into
by the government with Indian tribes. To withhold
the means necessary for the performance of a
promise is always false economy, and is apt to prove
disastrous in its consequences. Especial care is
recommended to provide for Indians settled on their
reservation, such as by furnishing cattle and
agricultural implements to aid them in whatever efÂ­
forts they may make to support themselves, and
by the reestablishment and maintenance of schools
to bring them under the control of civilized intluÂ­
ences. I see no reason why Indians who can give
satisfactory proof of having by their own labor supÂ­
ported their families for a number of years, and who
are willing to detach themselves from their tribal reÂ­
lations, should not be admitted to the benefits of the
homestead act, and the privileges of citizenship, and
I recommend the passage of a law to that effect. It
will be an act of justice as welias a measure of enÂ­
couragement. Earnest efforts ame being made to puÂ­
rify the Indian Service so that every dollar approÂ­
priated by Congress shall redound to the benefit of
the Indian. The efforts will have my firm support.
With an improved service and every possible enÂ­
couragement held out to the Indians to better their
condition and to elevate them in the scale of civilizaÂ­
tion we may hope to do at the same time a good work
for them and for ourselves.
PRESERVING UIILIC TIMBER.
I invite the attention of Congress to the importÂ­
ance of the statements and suggestions by the SecÂ­
retary of the Interior concerning the depredations
committed upon the timber lands of the United
States and the necessity for the preservation of forÂ­
ests. It is believed that the measures taken in purÂ­
suance of the existing law to arrest these depredaÂ­
tions will be entirely successful if Congress by an apÂ­
propriation for that purpose renders their continued
enforcement possible. The experience of other naÂ­
tions teaches us that a countrjÂ­ cannot be stripped of
its forests with impunity, and we shall expose ourÂ­
selves to the gravest consequences unless the wasteÂ­
ful and improvident manner which the forests in the
United States are destroyed be effectually checked.
I earnestly recommend that the measures
suggested by the Secretary of the Interior for the
suppression of depredations on the public timber

 lauds of the United States for the selling of timber F
from the public lands, and for the preservation of F
forests, be embodied in law, and that, considering F
the urgent necessity of enabling the people of certain F
states and territories to purchase timber from the
public lands in a legal manner, which at present they
cannot do, such a law be passed without unavoidable F
delay.
BARREN LAND.
I would also call the attention of Congress to a F
statement made by the Secretary of the Interior conÂ­
cerning the disposition that might be made of the
desert lands not irrigatable, west of the one hundreth I
meridian. These lands are practically unsalable unÂ­
der the existing laws, and the suggestion is worthy
of consideration, that a system of lease would make
them a source of profit to the United States, while at
the same time legalizing the business of cattle-raisÂ­
ing, which is at present carried on upon them. '
THE HARVEST. '
The report of the Commissioner of Agriculture
contains the gratifying announcement of the extraÂ­ 'I
ordinary success which has rewarded the agriculÂ­
tural industry of the country for the past year. 'I
With the fair prices which obtain for the products of
the soil, especially for the surplus which our people
have to export, we may confidently turn to this as
the most important of all our resources for the reÂ­
vival of the depressed industries of the country. S
The report shows our agricultural progress during $
the year and contains a statement of the work done
by this department for the advancement of agriculÂ­ c
tural industry, upon which the prosperity of our r
people ,o largely depends. Matters of information h
are included of great interest to all who seek by the s
experience of others to improve their own methods $
of cultivation. The effoits of the (lepartment a
increase the production of important artiÂ­ a
cles of consumption, and it is hoped n
will improve the demand for labor and a
advance the business of the country and eventually r
result in saving some of the many millions that are y
now annually paid to foreign nations for sugar and
other staple products which habitual use has made t
necessary in our every-day life. r
CENTENNIAL REPORT.
The Board in behalf of the Executive Departments a
on the International Exposition of 1876 has concluded c1
its labors. The final report of the Board was transÂ­ a
mitted to Congress by the last session. As these paÂ­ r
pers contain interesting and valuable information,
and will constitute the only report emanating from t
the government on the subject of 'the exhibition, I r
will invite attention to the matter and recommend r
that the report bhe published for general information. d
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. a
Congress is empowered by the Constitution with c
the authority of exclusive legislation over the DisÂ­ ii
trictof Columbia in which the seat of government 11
of the nation is located. The interests of the DisÂ­
trict, having no direct representation in Congress, t
are entitled to especial consideration and care at the c
hands of the general government. The Capital of r
the United States belongs to the nation, and it is c
natural that the American people should take pride
in the seat of their national government and desire
it to be an ornament to the country. Much has been a
done to render it healthful, convenient and attracÂ­ -
tive,.but much remains to be clone, which its perÂ­
manent inhabitants are not able and ought not to be
expectedto do. To impose upon them the outlay
required for public improvements, which are in a
great measure planned and executed for the convenÂ­
ience of the government and of the many thousands
of visitors from all parts of tile country, who
temporarily reside in the Capital of the nation, is an
edvient injustice. Special attention is asked by the
Commissioners of the District, in their report, which
is herewith transmitted, to the importance of a perÂ­ F
manent adjustment by Congress of the linancial reÂ­
lations between the United States and the District,
involving the regular annual contribution lby the
United States of its just proportion of the expenses
of the District government, of the outlay of all needÂ­
ed public improvements and such measure of relief F
from the burden of taxation now resting on the
people of the District as in the wisdom of Congress F
may be deemed just. The report of the CommissionÂ­
ers shows that the affairs of tie District are in a conÂ­ F
dition as satisfactory as could he expected, in view
of the heavy debt resting thereupon and its verylimÂ­ F
ited means for the necessary expensesthe debtof the
District is as follows: Funded debt SS,357-,691.96; 3.85 F
bonds guaranteed by the United States, $13,743,2530;
total bonded debt, $22,122,941.96; to which should be F
added certain outstanding claims as explained in
the report of the Commissioners-$11S,220,452, makÂ­
ing the total debt of the District, 523,310,146.4S. The
Connnissioners also ask attention to the importance
of the improvement of the Potomac River and the
reclamation of the marshes bordering on the City of e
Washington, and their views upon this subject are
concurred in by the members of the Board of
Health, whose report is also herewith transmitted.
BOJth the commercial and sanitary interests of the
District will be greatly promoted, I doubt not, by this
improvement. Your attention is invited to the suggesÂ­
tion of the Commissioners and of the Board of
Health, for the organization of a Board of Charities
to have supervision and control of the disbursement
of all moneys for charitable purposes fronm tile DisÂ­
trict treasury. I desire also to ask your especial atÂ­
tention to the need of adding to the efficiency of
the public schools of the District by a supplemental F
appropriation, aid from tihe national treasury. This
is especially just since so large a number of those
attending schools are children of employes of the
Government. I earnestly commend to your care
the interests of the people of the District who are so
intimately associated with the government estabÂ­
lishments, and to whose enterprise the good order
and attractiveness of the Capital are largely due,and
I ask your attention to the request of the CommisÂ­
sioners for legislation in behalf of the interests enÂ­
trusted to their care. The appropriations asked for
the care of reservations belonging to the government F
within their charge by the Commissioners of Public
Buildings and Grounds are also commendled to your
favorable consideration.
The report of the Joint Commission created biy the
act approved August 2, 1176, an act providing for the -
completion of the Washiugton monument, is also
herewith transmitted, with accompanying docuÂ­ tl
ments. The board of engineer ofllcers detailed to tl
examine the monumnent, in compliance with ri
the second section of the act, have reported 5
that the foundation is insullclent. No authority n
exists for making the expenditure necessary to ti
secure its stability. I therefore recommend that the 8
Commission be authorized to expenld such portion 4
of the sum appropriated by the act as may be necesÂ­
sary for the purpose. The present unfinished condiÂ­


LtUlu 01 IIU IIUIUIt.11, UKguu so iou101g ago, is a reÂ­ i
proach to the nation. It cannot be doubted that the F
patriotic sense of the country will mainly respond to F
such prompt provision as may be made for its comÂ­ F
pletion at an early day, and I urge upon Congress F
the propriety and necessity of immediate legislation
for this purpose. F
EDUCATIONAL.
The wisdom of legislation upon the part of ConÂ­ F
gress in aid of the States for education of the whole F
people in those branches of study which are taught
in the common schools of the country is no longer a F
question. The intelligent judgment of the country
goes still further regarding it, as also both constituÂ­ F
tional and expedient for the general government to I
extend to technical and higher education such aid as F
is deemed essential to the general welfare, and to
our due prominence among the enlightened and culÂ­
tivated nations of the world. The ultimate settleÂ­
ment of all questions of the future, whether of adÂ­ r
ministration or finance, or of true nationality of selÂ­ a
timent, depends upon the virtue and intelligence of I
the people. It is vain to hope for the I
success of a free government without the J
means of insuring the intelligence I
of those who are the source of power. No less than i
one seventh of the entire voting population of our 1
country are yet unable to read and write. It is enÂ­ I
couraging to observe in connection with the growth I
of fraternal feeling in those States in which slavery I
formerly existed evidences of increasing interest in
uinive'sal education, and I shall be glad to give my
approval to any appropriate measures which may be
enacted by Congress for the purpose of supplementÂ­
ing with national aid the local systems of education
in these States, and in all the States. Having already I
invited your attention to the needs of the District of 3
Columbia with respect to its public school I
system, I here add that I believe it deÂ­
sirable, not so much with reference to the
local wants of the District, but the great and lasting
benefit of the entire country, that this system should
be crowned with a university in all respects in keepÂ­
ing with the national capital, and thereby realize the
cherished hopes of Washington on this subject. I
also earnestly commend the request of the Regents
of the Smithsonian Institute that an adequate approÂ­
priation be made for the conduct of a national m0uÂ­
seum under their supervision. r
The subject of providing for preservation and a
growth of the library of Congress is also one of naÂ­ '
tional importance. As the depositary of copyright ]
publications and records, this library has out-grown J
the provisions for its accommodation, and the erecÂ­ 3
tion on such site as the judgment of Congress may I
approve, of a fire-proof library building to preserve I
the treasures and enlarge the usefulness of this valÂ­ I
uable collection, is recommended.
I recommend, also, such legislation as will render
available and efficient for the purpose of instruction,
so far as consistent with the public service, the
cabinets or museums of invention, of surgery, of
education and of agriculture and other collections, I
the property of the National Government.
The capital of the nation should be something f
more than amere political center. We should avail t
ourselves of all the opportunity which providence t
has placed at our command to commit the general
intelligence of the people and increase the conditions c
most favorable to the success and perpetuity of its c
institutions. (Signed) R. B. HAYESS.

11 BRYAN FORMALLY ACCEPTS.

I

ILLIAM J. BRYAN has
ent the following letter of acÂ­
ceptance to the notification

on|mlttee- of the Chicago convention:
Hon. Stephen M. White and Others,
Members of the Notification Committee
â€¢of the Democratic National Convention.â€”

Gentlemen: I accept the nomination
tendered by yon on behalf of the DemoÂ­
cratic party, and in so doing desire to
.assure you that I fully appreciate the
ihigh honor which such a nomination conÂ­
fers and the grave responsibilities which
Accompany
â€¢of the United
Impressed with
â€¢ed vested by the Constitution in the Chief
'Executive of the nation and with .the
benefit or injury of the people that I wish
to enter the office, if elected, free from'
â€¢every personal desire except the desire to
prove worthy the confidence of my counÂ­
try. Human judgment is fallible enough
when unbiased by selfish considerations,
â€¢and in order that I may not be tempted to
use the patronage of the office to advance
Any personal ambition, I hereby announce,
with nil the emphasis which words can
Â«xprbf ray fixed determination not, unÂ­
~T"" circumstances, to be a candidate
|'ection in case this campaign reÂ­
election.

Indorsee the Platform.

I have carefully considered the platÂ­
form adopted by the Democratic national
â€¢convention and unqualifiedly iiidorse each
plank thereof.

Our institutions rest upon the proposiÂ­
tion that all men, being created equal,
!are entitled to equal, consideration at the
'hands of the Government. Because all
men are created equal it follows that no
citizen has a natural right to injure any
other citizen. The main purpose of govÂ­
ernment being to protect all citizens in
the enjoyment of life, liberty and the purÂ­
suit of happiness, this purpose must lead
the Government, first, to avoid acts of
'affirmative injustice, and, second, to reÂ­
strain each citizen from trespassing upon
the rights of any other citizen.

A democratic form of government is
conducive to the highest civilization beÂ­
cause it opens before each individual the
.greatest opportunities^ for development
and stimulates to the highest endeavor by
insuring to each the full enjoyment of
all the rewards of toil except such contriÂ­
bution as is necessary to Bupport the GovÂ­
iernment which protects him. Democracy
da indifferent to pedigreeâ€”it deals with
the individual rather than with his anÂ­
cestors. Democracy ignores differences
jin wealthâ€”neither riches nor poverty can
Ibe Invoked in behalf of or against any citÂ­
n. Democracy knows no creedâ€”recog-

SSng the right of each individual to
Jlp God according to the dictates of
â„¢wn conscience, it welcomes all to a
on brotherhood and guarantees
treatment to all, no matter in what
church or through what forms they comÂ­
mune with their Creator.

Having discussed portions of the platÂ­
form at tne time of its adoption and again
-when your letter of notification was forÂ­
mally delivered, it will not be necessary
at this time to touch upon all the subjects
ambraced in the party's declaration.

A Dual Government.

Honest differences of opinion have ever
,existed and ever will exist as to the most
effective means of securing domestic tranÂ­
quility, but no citizen fails to recognize
Idt all times and under all circumstances
ithe absolute necessity for the prompt and
vigorous enforcement of law and the
'preservation of the public peace. In a
'government like ours law is but the crysÂ­
'tallization of the will of the people with
out it the citizen is neither secure in the
enjoyment of life and liberty nor protectÂ­
ed in the pursuit of happiness. Without
lobedience to law government is impossiÂ­
ble. The Democratic party.is pledged to
^defend the Constitution and enforce the

!lawa

of the United States, and it is also
'pledged to respect and preserve the dual
[scheme of government instituted by the
founders of the republic. The name UniÂ­
ted States was happily chosen. It comÂ­
bines the idea of national strength with
Ithe idea of local self-government and sugÂ­
gests ""an indissoluble union of indestructÂ­
ible States.""

Our revolutionary fathers, fearing the
tendencies toward centralization, as well
las the dangers of disintegration, guarded

1

gainst both and national safety, as well
aestic security, is to be found in the
observance of the limitations

H4ichVthey

impose. It will be noticed

Jljpot, while the United States guarantees
to%very State a republican form of govÂ­
ernment and is empowered to protect each
State against invasion, it is not authorÂ­
to interf

jized uterfere in the domestic affairs
'of any State except upon application of
the Legislature of the State or upon the
Application of the Executive when the
Legislature cannot be convened.

This provision rests upon the sound
theory that the people of the State, acting
through their legally chosen representaÂ­
tives. are, because of their more intimate
acquaintance with local conditions, better
qualified than the President to judge of
the necessity for Federal assistance.
Those who framed our Constitution wiseÂ­
ly determined to make as broad an appliÂ­
cation of the principles of local self-govÂ­
ernment as circumstances would permit,
and we cannot dispute the correctness of
the position taken by them without exÂ­
pressing a distrust of the people themÂ­
selves.

Economy*

Since governments exist for the protecÂ­
tion of the rights of the people and not
for their spoliation, no expenditure of pubÂ­
money can be justified unless that exÂ­
ile money can be jus
liture is necessary for the honest,

economical and efficient administration of
the government. In determining what apÂ­
propriations are necessary the Interest
of those who pay the taxes should be conÂ­
sulted rather than the wishes of those
who receive or disburse public moneys.

Bonds.

An increase in the bonded debt of the
United States at this time is entirely withÂ­
out excuse. The issue of interest-bearing
bonds within the last few years has been
defended on the ground that they were
,ry to secure gold with which to
redeem United States notes and treasury
notes, but this necessity was imaginary
rather than real. Instead of exercising
the legal right vested in the United States
to redeem its coin in either gold or silver,
the executive branch of the Government
has followed a precedent established by a
former administration and surrendered

a pecuniary profit in bond issues. The
fact that the dealers in money and securiÂ­
ties have been able to deplete the treasury
according to the changing whims shows
how dangerous It is to permit them to
exercise a controlling influence on the
Treasury Department.

The government of the United States
when administered in the interest of all
the people is able to establish and enforce
its financial policy, not only without the
aid of syndicates, but in spite of any
opposition which syndicates may present.
To assert that the Government is dependÂ­
ent upon the good will or assistance of
any portion of the people other than a
constitutional majority is to assert that
we have a government in form, but withÂ­
out vital force.

National Bank Currency.
The position taken by the platform
against the issue of paper money by naÂ­
tional banks is supported by the highest
Democratic authority as well as demandÂ­
ed by the interests of the people. The
present attempt of the national banks to
force the retirement of United States
notes and treasury notes in order to seÂ­
cure a basis for a larger issue of their own
notes illustrates the danger which arises
from permitting them to Issue their paper
as a circulating medium. The national
bank note, being redeemable in lawful
money, has never been better than the
United States note which stands behind
it, and yet the banks persistently demand
that these United States notes, which
draw no interest, shall give place to interÂ­
est-bearing bonds in order that the banks
may collect the interest which the people
now save.

To empower national banks to issue
circulating notes is to grant a valuable
privilege to a favored class, surrender to
private corporations the control over the
volume of paper money and build up a
class which will claim a vested interest
in the nation's financial policy. Our UniÂ­
ted States notes, commonly known as
greenbacks, being redeemable in either
gold or silver, at the option of the GovÂ­
ernment, and not at the option of the
holder, are safer and cheaper for the
people their national bank notes based upÂ­
on Interest-bearing bonds.

The Monroe Doctrine.

A dignified but firm maintenance of the
foreign policy set forth by President MonÂ­
roe and reiterated by the Presidents who
have succeeded him, Instead of arousing
hostility abroad, is the best guaranty of
amicable relations with other nations. It
la better for all concerned that the United
States should resist any extension of EuÂ­
ropean authority in the Western hemisÂ­
phere rather than invite the continual irriÂ­
tation which would necessarily result
from any attempt to increase the influÂ­
ence of monarchical institutions over that
portion of the Americas which has been
dedicated to republican government.

Pension*

No nation can afford to be unjust to its
defenders. The care of those who have
suffered injury in the military and naval
service of the country is a sacred duty. A
nation which, like the United States, reÂ­
lies upon voluntary service rather than
upon a large standing army, adds to its
own security when it makes generous proÂ­
vision for those who have risked tneir
lives in its defense, and for those who
are dependent upon them.

The Producers of Wealth.
Labor creates capital. Until wealth is
produced by the application of brain and
muscle to the resources of this country
there is nothing to divide among the nonÂ­
producing classes of society. Since the
producers of wealth create the nation's
prosperity in time of peace and defend the
nation's flag in time of peril, their interÂ­
ests ought at all times to be considered
by those who stand in official positions.
The Democratic party has ever found its
voting strength among those who are
proud to be known as the common people,
and it pledges itself to propose ana enact
such legislation as is necessaiy to protect
the masses in the free exercise of every
political right and in the enjoyment of
their just share of the rewards of their
labor.

Arbitration.

I desire to give special emphasis to the
plank which recommends such legislation as
Is necessary to secure the arbitration of
differences between employers engaged In
Interstate commerce and their employes. ArÂ­
bitration Is not a new Ideaâ€”It is simply an
extension of the court of justice. The laborÂ­
ing men of the country have expressed a
desire for arbitration and the railroads canÂ­
not reasonably object to the decisions renÂ­
dered by an Impartial tribunal. Society has
an Interest even greater than the Interest
of employer or employe and has a right to
protect itself by courts of arbitration agalaat

if

the growing inconvenience and embarrass
ment occasioned by disputes between those
who own the great arteries of commerce on
the one hand and the laborers who operate
them on the other.

Immigration.

While the Democratic party welcomes to
the country those who come with love for
our Institutions and with the determination
and ability to contribute to the strength
and greatness of our nation, it is opposed
to the dumping of the criminal classes upon
our shores and to the Importation of cither
pauper or contract labor to compete with
American labor.

In junctions.

The recent abuses which have grown out
of Injunction proceedings have been so emÂ­
phatically condemned by public opinion that
the Senate bill providing for trial by Jury
In certain contempt cases will meet with
general approval.

Trasts.

The Democratic party Is opposed to trusts.
It would be recreant to its duty to the people
of the country if It recognized either, the
moral or the legal' right of these neat aggreÂ­
gations of wealth to stifle competition, bankÂ­
rupt rivals and then prey upon society. CorÂ­
porations are the creatures of law, and they
must not be permitted to pass from under
the control of the power which created thems
they are permitted to exist upon the.theory
that they advance the public weal, and they
must not be allowed to use their powers for
the public Injury.

Railroads.

The right of the United States Government
to regulate Interstate commerce cannot be
questioned, and the necessity for the vigorÂ­
ous exercise of that right is becoming moro
and more Imperative. The interests of the
whole people require such an enlargement
of the powers of the interstate commerce
commission as will enable It to prevent disÂ­
crimination between persons and places ana
protect patrons from unreasonable charges.

Pacific Railroads.

The Government cannot afford to discrimÂ­
inate between Its debtors, and must, there-,
fore, prosecute its legal claims against the
Pacific railroads. Sucn a policy Is necessary
for the protection of the rights of the pa-,
trons as well as for the interests of the Gov*
ernment.

Cnba.

The people of the United States, happy in
the enjoyment of the blessings of free govÂ­
toward
blessÂ­
ings for themselves. This sympathy, .while
respecting all treaty obligations. Is especialÂ­
ly active and earnest when excited 6y the
struggles of neighboring peoples, who, like
the Cubans, are near enough to observe the
workings of a government which derives
all its authority from the consent of the
governed.

The Civil Service.

That the American people are not In favor,
of life tenure In the civil service Is evident,
from the fact that they, as a rule, make fre*
quent changes .In their official representaÂ­
tives when those representatives are chosen'
by ballot. A permanent office-holding class
Is not in harmony with our Institutions. A
fliefi term in appointive offices, except where
the Federal Constitution now provides othÂ­
erwise, would open the public service to aÂ­
larger number of citizens without Impairing
its efficiency.

The Territories.

The Territorial form of government is
temporary In its nature and should give way
as soon as the Territory Is sufficiently adÂ­
vanced to take Its place among the States..
New Mexico, Oklahoma and Arizona are enÂ­
titled to Statehood, and their early admisÂ­
sion is demanded by their material and politÂ­
ical Interests. The demand of the platform
that officials appointed to administer the
government of the Territories, the District
of Columbia and Alaska should be bona fide
residents of the Territories or District Is enÂ­
tirely In keeping with the Democratic theory
of home rule. I am also heartily In symÂ­
pathy with the declaration that all public
lands should be reserved for the establishÂ­
ment of free homes for American citizens.

Waterways.

The policy of Improving the great water-,
ways of the country Is justified by the naÂ­
tional character of those waterways and the
enormous tonnage borne upon them. ExÂ­
perience has demonstrated that continuing
appropriations are, in the end, more econ-,
omlcal than single appropriations separated
by long intervals.

The Tariff.

It Is not necessary to discuss the tariff
question at this time. Whatever may be the
Individual views of citizens as to the relative
merits of protection and tariff reform, ail
must recognize that until the money quesÂ­
tion is fully and finally settled the American
people will not consent to the consideration,
of any other Important question. Taxation
presents a problem which In some form Is
continually present, and a postponement of
definite action upon It Involves no sacrifice
of personal opinion or political principles
but the crisis presented by financial condiÂ­
tions cannot be postponed. Tremendous reÂ­
sults will follow the action taken by the UniÂ­
ted States on the money question and delay
is impossible. The people of this nation, sitÂ­
ting as a high court, must render Judgment
in the cause which greed is prosecuting
against humanity. The decision will eitherÂ­
give hope and inspiration to those who toil
or ""shut the doors of mercy on mankind.""
In the presence of this overshadowing IsatM,
differences upon minor questions must be
laid aside in order that there may be united
action among those who are determined
that progress toward a universal gold standÂ­
ard shall be stayed, and the gold and silver
coinage of the Constitution restore^

A Chinese Funeral.

A well-conducted Chinese funeral
the most forgeous sight in Asia. At the
front of the funeral procession walk
the noisy, musicless musicians. Then
come men bearing the insignia of the
dignity of the dead, if he had any. Next
come more men, carrying figures of
animals, idols, umbrellas and blue an
white streamers. After them come men
carrying pans of perfume. Just beÂ­
fore the coffin walk bonzes, Chinese
priests. Over the coffin a canopy ia
usually carried. The casket Is borne
by about a score of men. Immediately
behind the coffin walk the children of
the deceased. The eldest son comes
flret. He is dressed in canvas and leans
heavily upon a stout stick. He is sup-'
posed to be too exhausted by grief and
fasting to walk without the aid of thai
staff. The other children and relatives
follow this chief mourner. They aro
clothed In white linen garments. The,
women are carried in chain. They sobi
and wail at intervals and in unison.'
When the burying place is reached the
bonzes begin chanting a mass for thai
dead, and the coffin ia put in the tomb.!
A large, oblong white marble table is'
placed before the tomb. On the middlo
of it are set a censer and two rases and!
two candlesticks, all of as exquisite
workmanship as possible. Then they,
have a paper cremation. Paper figures
of men, horses, garments and a score!
of other things are burned. They are
supposed to undergo a material resurÂ­
rection and to be useful to the dead in
the Chinese heaven. The tomb is sealÂ­
ed up or closed, and an entertainment'
concludes the ceremony at the grave.-*

Noise.

That birds do not mind a noise so
long as they feel safe from enemies is
shown by a pair of pewees, who built
a nest last spring and hatched out a
orood in a North Limlngton, Me., sawÂ­
mill. The nest is on a horizontal Joist,
within six feet of the end of the car-'
riage where the logs are rolled. At
the time of the building, laying and
hashing, three saws were running and
five men at work in the mill","unknown"
"681","3522211","be more emparÂ­
rassed in this respect than any subsequent
period. It is here that the constitution seems
to most prove of its claim to be the great
wisdom accorded to it gives the Executive the
assistance of the knowledge and experienc
of the Senate, which, when acting upon nomiÂ­
nations as to which they may be disinterested
and impartial judges, secures as strong a
guarantee of freedom of errors of importance
as is perhaps possible in human affairs. In
addition to this, I recognize the public adÂ­
vantage of making all nominations as nearly
as possible in person. In the sense of being
free from mere caprice or favor
in these directions, and in those offices
-which special training is of greatly increased
value, I believe such a rule as to the tenure of
office should obtain as may induce men of
proper qualifications to apply themselves inÂ­
distriously to the task of becoming proficients.
Bearing these things in mind, I have endeavÂ­
ored to reduce the number of changes in subÂ­
ordinate places usually made upon the change
of the general administration, and shall most
heartily co-operate with Congress in the best
systematizing of such methods and rules of
admission to the public service, and ofypromoÂ­
tion within it as may promise to be nmst sucÂ­
cessful, in making thorough competency, effiÂ­
ciency and character the decisive tests in these
matters..
I ask the renewed attention of Congress to
what has already been done by the civil serÂ­
vice commission appointed in pursuance of act
of Congress by my predecessor to prepare and
revise the civil service rules. In regard to
much of the departmental service, especially
at Washington, it may be difficult to organize
a better system than that which has thus been
provided, and it is now b'eing used to a considÂ­
erable extent, under my direction. The ComÂ­
mission has still a legal existence, althoughfor
several years no appropriation has been made
for defraying its expenses. Believing that this
commission has rendered valuable service, and
will be a most universal agency in improving
the administration of the civil service,
I respectfully recommend that a
suitable appropriation to be immediately made
to enable it to continue its service. It is my
purpose to transmit to Congress as early as
practicable, a report by the Chairman of the
Commission, and to ask your attention to such
measures upon this4subject as in my opinion
will further promote the improvement of the
civil service.
FOREIGN RELATIONS.
' During the past year the United States have conÂ­
tinued to maintain peaceful relations with foreign
powers. The outbreak of war between Russia and
Turkey, though at one time attended by grave apÂ­
prehensions as to its effect upon other European
nations, has had no tendency to disturb the amicaÂ­
ble relations existing between the United States and
each of the contending powers. An attitude of just
and impartial neutrality has been preserved, and I
am gratified to state that in the midst of their hostiliÂ­
ties both the Russian and the Turkish Governments 1
have shown an earnest desire to adhere to the obliÂ­ I
gations of all treaties with the United States and
give due regard to the rights of American citizens.
By the terms of the treaty defining the rights, imÂ­
.munities and privileges of consuls between Italy'
and the United States, ratified in 1868, either governÂ­
ment may after the lapse of ten years terminate the
existence of the treaty by giving twelve months' noÂ­
tice of its intention. The government of Italy, availÂ­
ing itself of this, has now given the required notice.
The treaty will accordingly end on the 15th of SepÂ­
tember, 1878. It. is understood, however, that the
Italian government wishes to renew in its general
scope, desiring only certain modifications in some of
its al-ticles. h this disposition I concur, and shall
hope that no serious obstacles may intervene to preÂ­
vent or delay the negotiaion of a satisfactory treaty.
Numerous questions in regard to passports, naturÂ­
alization and.exemption from military service, have
continued to arise in cases of emigrants from GerÂ­
many, who have returned to their native country.
The provisions of the treaty of February 22, 1868,
however, have proved to be so ample and so judiÂ­
cious that the legation of the United States at Berlin


bhas been able to adjust all claims arising under it,
not only without detriment to the amicable relations
existing between the two governments, but it is beÂ­
lieved without injury or injustice duly naturalized
American citizen. It is desirable that the treaty
originally made with the North-German Union in
1867 should now be extended so as to apply equally
to all the States of the Empire of Germany.
The institution of the government of France to
participate in the exposition of the products of agriÂ­
culture, industry and the fine arts, to be held at Paris
during the coming year, was submitted for your conÂ­
sideration at the extra session. It is not doubted
that its acceptance by the United States, and a wellÂ­
selected exhibition of the products of American inÂ­
dustry on that occasion, will tend to stimulate interÂ­
national commerce and immnigration, as well as to
promote friendship between the two countriest
A question arose some time since as to the proper
meaning of the extraditing articles of the treaty of
1843 between the United States and Great Britain.
Both governments, however, are now in accord in
the belief that the question is not one that should be
allowed to frustrate the ends of justice or to disturb.
the friendship between the two nations. No serious
difficulty has arisen in accomplishing the extradition
of criminals when necessary. It is probable that the
points of disagreement will in due time be settled,
and if need be. more explicit declarations be made in
a new treaty. The Fishery Commission under artiÂ­
cles 28 and 30, of the Treaty of Washington,
has concluded its session. The result of
the deliberations of the Commission as made public
by the Commissioners, will be communicated to
Congress, A treaty for the protection of tradeÂ­
anarks has been negotiated with Great Britain, which
has been submitted to the Senate for consideration.
The revolution which recently occurred in Mexico
was followed by the accession of the successful parÂ­
ty to power and the installation of its chief ganeral,
Poriirio Diaz, in the Presidentialoilce. It has been
the custom of the United States wheni such changes
of government have heretofore occurred in Mexico
to recognize and enter into offilcial relations with the
â€¢defacto government as soon as it should appear
to have the approval of the MIexican people
and should manifest a disposition to adhere to
the obligations of treaties and international
friendship. In the present case such official recogÂ­
nition has been deferred by the occurrences on the
Rio Grande border, the records of which have alÂ­
ready been communicated to each House of ConÂ­
gress in answer to their respective resolutions of inÂ­
qluiry. Assurances have been received that the auÂ­
thorities at the seat of the Mexican government have
both the disposition and the power to prevent and
punish such unlawful invasions and depredations.
It is earnestly to be hoped that events may prove
these assurances to be well founded. The best inÂ­
terests of both countries require the maintenance
of peace upon the border, and the development of
commerce between the two Republics. It is gratifyÂ­
ing to add that this temporary interruptioni of oillcial
relations has not prevented duie attention
by the representatives of the United
States in Mexico to the protection of
American citizens so far as practicable; nor has it
interfered with the prompt payment of the amounts
due from Mexico to the United States under the
treaty of July 4, 1868, and the awards of the Joint
Commission. While I do not anticipate an InterrupÂ­
tion of the friendly relations with Mexico. yet I canÂ­
not but look with some solicitude on a continuance
of the brder disorders as exposing the two countries
to initiations of popular feeling and mischances of
-action, which are naturally unfavorable to complete
amity. Firmly determined that nothing shall be
wanting on their part to promote a good understandÂ­
ing between the two nations, I yet must ask the
attention of Congress to the actual occurrences on
-the border, that-the lives and property of our citizens
may be adequately protected and peace preserved.
Another year has passed without bringing 'to a
close the protracted contest between the Spanish
government and tihe insurrection in the island of
Cuba. While the United States have sedulously
abstained from any intervention in this controversy.
it is impossible not to feel that it is attended by inÂ­
cidents affecting the rights of American citizens
apart from the effect of the hostilities upon the trade
between the United States anud Cuba. Their progÂ­
ress is inevitably accompanied by complaints,
having more or less foundation, of searches, arrests,
embargoes and oppressive taxes upon the property
of American residents and of unprovoked
interference with American vessels and comÂ­
Inerce. It is due to the government of Spain
to say that during the past year it has promptly disÂ­

 avowed and offered reparation for any unauthorized
acts of zealous subordinates whenever Such acts have
been brought to its attention. Nevertheless such ocÂ­
currences cannot but tend to excite feelings of anÂ­
noyance, suspicion and resentment, which are greatÂ­
ly tobe deprecated, between the respective subjects
and citizens of two friendly powers.
Much delay consequent on the occasions of fraud
in some of the awards has occurred in respect to the
distribution of the limited amounts received from
Venezuela under the treaty of April 25, 1866,applicable
to the awards of the joint commissioners created by
that treaty. So long as these matters are pending
in Congress the Executive cannot assume either to
pass upon the questions presented or to distribute
the fund received. It is eminently desirable that
definite legislative action should be taken either deÂ­
ciding the awards to be final or providing some
method for examination of the claims. Our relations
with the Republics of Central and South America
and with the Empire of Brazil have continued withÂ­
out serious change further than the temporary interÂ­
ruption of diplomatic intercourse with Venezuela and
with Guatemala. Amicable relations have already
been fully restored with Venezuela, and it is not
doubted that all grounds of misundersttznding with
Guatemala will speedily be removed. From all these
countries there are favorable indications of a disÂ­
position on the part of their governments and people
to reciprocate our efforts in the direction of increased
commercial intercourse.
The government of the Samoan Islands has sent
an envoy in the person of its Secretary of State to
invite the government of the United States to advise
and protect their independence, to establish comÂ­
mercial relations with their people and to assist them
in their steps towards responsible and regular govÂ­
ernment. The inhabitants of these Islands having
made considerable progress in Christian civilization'
and in the development of trade are doubtful of their
ability to maintain peace and independence without
the aid of some stronger power. The subject is
deemed worthy of respectful attention and the
claims upon our assistance by this independent conmÂ­
munity will be carefully considered.
BUSINESS DEPRESSION.
The long commercial depression in the United
States has directed attention to the subject of the
possible increase of our foreign trade and the methÂ­
ods for its development, not only with Europe but
with other countries, and especially with the states
and sovereignties of the Western Hemisphere. InÂ­
structions from the Department of State were isÂ­
sued to the various diplomatic and consular olfices
of the Government, asking them to devote attention
to the question of methods by which trade between
the respective countries of their official residences
and the United States could be most judiciously
founded. In obedience to the instructions, exÂ­
aminations and reports upon this subject have been
made by many of these officers and transmitted to
thb Department, and the same are submitted to the
cohsideration of Congress.
FINANCIAL.
The annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury
presents important questions for the action of ConÂ­
gress, upon some of which I have already remarked.
The revenues of the government during the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1877, were $269,000,5b6.6'2. The
total expenditures for the same period were $23S,Â­
660,00S.93, leaving a surplus revenue of $30,340,577.69.
This has substantially supplied the requirements of
the sinking fund for that year. The estimated reveÂ­
nues of the current fiscal year are $2i5,500,000, and
the estimated expenditures for the same period are
$232,430,643.72. If these estimates prove to be
correct there will be a surplus revenue of $33,Â­
069,856.28, an amount nearly sufficient for
the sinking fund for that year. The
estimated revenues for the next fiscal year are
$269,250,000. It appears from the report that during
the last fiscal year the revenues of the government
compared with the previous year, have largely deÂ­
creased. This decrease, amounting to the sunm of
$18,481,452.54, was mainly in customs duties caused
partly by a large falling off of the amount of imÂ­
ported dutiable goods and partly by the general fall
of prices in the markets of the productions of such
articles as pay ad valorem taxes. While this is felt
injurious it has been accompanied with a
very large increase of exportations. Tne total
'exports during the last fiscal year, including coin,
has been $658,637,457 and the imports have been $192,Â­
097,540, leaving a balance of trade in favor of the
United, States amounting to the sum of $166,539,917,
the beneficial effects of which extend to all branches
of business. The estimated revenue for the next
fiscal year will impose upon Congress the duty of
strictly limiting the appropriations, including the
requisite sum for the maintenance of the sinking
fund, within the aggregate estimate of receipts.
While the aggregate of taxes should not be increased
amendments might be made to the revenue laws
that would without diminishing the revenue
relieve the people from unnecessary burdens.
A tax on tea and coffee is shown by the experience
not only of our own country but of other countries
to ibe easily collected without loss by undervaluation
or fraud and largely borne in the country of producÂ­
tion. A tax of 10 cents per pound on tea and two
cents per pound on colffee would produce a revenue
exceeding $12,000,000, and thus enable Congress to
repeal a multitude of annoying taxes yielding a revÂ­
enue not exceed!ng that sum. The internal revenue
system grew out of the necessities of the war, and
most of the legislation imposing taxes upon domesÂ­
tic products under this system has been repealed.
By the substitution of a tax on tea and coffee all
forms of internal taxation may be repealed, except
that on whisky, spirits, tobacco and beer.
REVENUE LAWS.
Attention is also called to the necessity of enacting
more vigorous laws for the protection of the revenue
and for the punishment of frauds and smuggling.
This can be best done by judicious provisions that
will induce the disclosure of attempted fraud by unÂ­
dervaluation and smuggling. All revenue laws
should be simple in their provisions and easily unÂ­
derstood. So far as practicable the rates of taxation
should be in the form of specific duties and not adÂ­
valorem, requiring the judgment of experienced
men to ascertain values and exposing the revenue to
the temptation of fraud. IMy attention has been
called during the recess of Congress to the abuses
in connection with the customs, and strenuous efforts
have been made for their correction by executive
orders. The recommendations submitted to the SecÂ­
retary of the Treasury by a commission appointed to
examine into the collection of customs duties at the
port of New York contain many suggestions for the
mnodification of the customs laws to which the attenÂ­
tion of Congress is invited.


It is a matter of congratulation that notwiths tandÂ­
ing the severe burdens caused by the war the public
faith with all creditors has been preserved, and as
the result of this policy the public credif has continÂ­
uously advanced and our public securities are reÂ­
garded with the highest favor in the markets of the
world. I trust that no act of the government will
cast a shadow upon its credit. The progress of reÂ­
funding the public debt has been rapid and satisfacÂ­
tory.
SUBSCRIPTION TO BONDS.
Under the contract existing when I entered upon
the discharge of the duties of my office the bonds
bearing interest at the rate of 4;! per cent. were beÂ­
ing rapidly sold and within three months the aggreÂ­
gate sales of these bonds had reached the sum of
$2L0,000,000. With my sanction the Secretary of the
Treasury entered into a new contract for the sale of
4 per cent bonds, and within 30 days after the popuÂ­
lar subscription for such bonds was opened. subÂ­
scriptions Were had amounting to $75,496,550, which
were paid for within 90 days after the date of the
subscription. By this process within but little more
than one year the annual interest on the public debt
was reduced in the sum of $3,775,000.
SAVINGS.
I recommend that suitable provision be made to
enable the people to easily convert their savings into
government securities, as the best mode in which
small savings may be well secured and yield a modÂ­
erate interest. It is an object of public policy to reÂ­
tain among our own people the securities of the
United States. In this way our country is guarded
against their sudden return from foreign countries,
caused by war or other disturbance beyond our conÂ­
trol.
INTERNATIONAL TRADE.
The commerce of the United States with foreign
nations and especially in the export of domestic
productions, has of late years largely increased, but
the greater portion of this trade is conducted
in foreign vessels. The importance of
enlarging our foreign trade and especially by diÂ­
rect and speedy interchange with the countries on
this continent, cannot be overestimated, and it is a
matter of great moment that our shipping interest
should receive, to the utmost practical extent, the
bonefit of our commerce with other lands. These
considerations are forcibly urged by all the large
commercial cities of the country, and public attenÂ­
tion is generally and wisely attracted to the solution
of the problems they present. It is not doubted that
Congress will take them up in the broadest spirit of
liberality and respond to the public demand by pracÂ­
ticable legislation upon this subject.
THE ARMIY.
The report of the Secretary of War shows that the
army has been actively employed during the
year, and has rendered very important service in
repressing hostilities in the Indian country, and
preserving peace and, proteeting life and property in
the interior, as well as along the Mlexican border.
A long and arduous campaign has been prosecuted
with tinal complete success against a portion of the
NezPerces tribe of Indians. A full account of this
campaign will be found in the report of the General
of the Army. It will be seen that in its course several
battles were fought, in which a number of gallant
oillcers and men lost their lives. I join with the SecÂ­
retary of War and the General of the Army in
awarding to the ofillcers and umen employed in the
long and toilsome pursuit, and in the final
capture of these Indians, the honor and praise which
is so justly their due.
TRADE TROUBLES.
The very serious riots which occurred in several
of the states in July last rendered necessary the emÂ­
ployment of a considerable portion of the army to
preserve peace and maintain order in the states of
West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Illinois.
These disturbances were so formidable as to defy
the local and state authorities, and the National exeÂ­
cutive.was called upon in the mode provided by the
Constitution and laws to furnish military, and I am
grateful to he able to state that the troops sent in reÂ­
sponse to these calls for aid in suppression of domesÂ­
tic violence, were able by the influence of their presÂ­
ence in the disturbed regions to preserve the peace
and restore order without the use of force. In the
discharge of this delicate and important duty both
officers and men acted with great prudence and
courage, and for their services deserve the thanks
of their country.
THE MEXICAN TROUBLES.
Disturbances along the Rio Grande in Texas, to
which I have already referred, have rendered necesÂ­
sary the coustant employment of a military force in
that vicinity. A full report of all recent military

 operations in that quarter has been transmitted to I1
the House of Representatives in answer to a resoluÂ­ fi
tion of that body, and it will not therefore be necesÂ­ fi
sary to enter into details. I regret to say that these tl
lawless incursions into our territory by armed bands s1
from the Mexican side of the line, for the purpose of p
robbery, have been of frequent occurrence, and in c
spite of the most vigorous efforts of the commander d
of our forces, the marauders have generally sucÂ­
ceeded in escaping into Mexico with their plunder.
In May last I gave orders for the exercise of .the utÂ­ si
most vigilance on the part of our troops c
for the suppression of these raids and the d
punishment of the guilty parties, as well as the reÂ­ n
capture of property stolen by:them. Gen. Ord, comÂ­ d
manding in Texas. was directed to invite the cooperÂ­ o
ation of the Mexican authorities in efforts to this t1
end, and assure ithem that I was anxious to avoid ti
giving the least offense to Mexico; at the sameltime ii
he was directed to give notice of my determination
to put an end to the invasion of our territory by lawÂ­
less bands, intent on the plunder of our peaceful c
citizens, even if the effectual punishment of the outÂ­ o
laws should make the crossing of the border by our ti
troops in their pursuit necessary. It is believed that X
this policy has had the effect to check somewhat ti
these depredations, and that with a considerable inÂ­ h
crease of our force upon that frontier, and the estabÂ­ t
lishment of several additional military posts along v
the Rio Grande, so as more effectually to guard that '1
extensive border, peace may be preserved and the t
lives and property of citizens in Texas be fully proÂ­ b
tected. ti
THE ARMY. p
Prior to the first day of July last the army was, in a
acdordance with law, reduced to the maximum of e
25,000 enlisted men, being a reduction of 2500 below o
the force previously authorized. This reduction was ii
made as required by law, entirely from the infantry c
and artillery branches of the service, without any reÂ­ v
duction of the cavalry. Under the law as it now a
stands, it is necessary that the Cavalry regiments be r
recruited to 100 men in each company for service on n
the Mexican and Indian frontiers. The necessary o
effect of this legislation is to reduce the infantry and n
artillery arms of the service below the number reÂ­
quired for efficiency, and I concur with the SecreÂ­
tary of War in recommending that authority be given o
to recruit all companies of infantry to at least lifty ii
men, and all batteries of artillery to at least seventyÂ­ i
five men, with power in case of emergency to inÂ­ p
crease the former to 100 and the latter to 125 men a
each. .
I invite your special attention to the following recÂ­ v
dmmendations of the Secretary of War: First, that t
provision be made for supplying to the army a more
abundant and better supply of leading matter.
Second, that early action be taken by Congress lookÂ­ t
ing to a complete revision and republication of the t:
army regulations. Third, that section 1258, of the o
Revised Statutes limiting the number of oflicers on t
the retired list be repealed. Fourth, that the claims a
arising under act of July 4, 1864, for supplies, taken h
by the army during the war, be taken from the offices t
of the Quartermaster and Commissary Generals, and v
transferred to the Southern Claims Commission, or i
some other tribunal having more time and better faÂ­ i
cilities for their prompt investigation and decision d
than are possessed by these olllcers. Fifth, that ConÂ­ t
gress provide for an annuity fund for the families of n
deceased soldiers, as recommended by the PaymlasÂ­ e
ter General of the army. r
THE NAVY.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy shows i
that we have six squadrons now engaged in the proÂ­ o
tection of our foreign commerce and other duties t,
pertaining to the naval service. The condition and e
operations of the department are also shown. The C
total expenditures for the fiscal year ending June 30, ih
1877, were $16,0T7,974.54. There are unpaid claims n
against the department chargeable to the last year lI
which are presented to the consisderation of Con-. i
gress. By the report of the Secretary the estimates I
for the liscal year commencing July 1, 1878, are o
16,233,234.40, exclusive of the sum of 231,443.11 subÂ­ e
mitted for new building, repairs and improvements f1
at tile several navy yards. The appropriations for p
present fiscal year commencing July, 1577, are n
$13,592,932.90. The amount drawn from the treasury e
from July 1 to November 1, 1877, is $3,343,037.40, of d
which there is estimated to be yet available $1,029,Â­ o
523 30, showing the amount of actual expenditure it
during the first four months of the present liscal year i
to have been $4,313,509.10. b
THE 1'OSTOFFICE DEPART3IENT. t
The report of the Postmaster General contains a a
full and clear statement of the operations and conÂ­ t;
dition of the Postollice Department. The ordinary it
revenues of the department for the fiscal year endÂ­ C
ing June 30, 1577, including receipts from the money o
order business and from olticial stamps and stamped "",
envelopes amounted to to the sum of $27,531,085.26. The
\
additional sum of $7,013,000 was received from apÂ­ c
propriation from the general treasury for various 1

DEPAIRTMENT OF JUSTICE. n
The report of the Attorney General contains sevÂ­ e
eral suggestions as to the administration of justice tl
to whica I invite attention. The pressure of busiÂ­ t
ness in the Supreme Court and mn certain circuit e
courts of the United States is now such that serious g
delays to the great injury anti even oppression of suitÂ­ (
ors occur, and a remedy should bie sought for. This o
condition of alf'irs, whether it will be found in the s
nhltn r'iiflv nl(tcllpd in ;lie l'lrenrt. of inr:l'nngino the


number of jutges of Circuit Courts, and by means p
of this addition to the judicial force of creating an
intermediate Court of Errors and Appeals, or s
whether some other mode can be devised for obviatÂ­
ing the difficulties which now exist, I leave to your tl
mature consideration.
TIIE INDIANS.
The present condition of the Indian tribes on the
Territory of the United States, and our relations with g
them, are fully set forth In the reports of the SecreÂ­
tary of the Interior and the Comniissioner of Indian i
Affairs. After a series of the most deplorable conÂ­
flicts, the successful termination of which while reÂ­
electing honor on the brave soldiers who accomÂ­ t
plished it, cannot lessen our regret at the occurrence. e
We are now at peace with all the Indian tribes in our 1
borders. To preserve that peace by a just and lhuÂ­ o
mane policy will be the object of my earnest endeavÂ­ t
ors. Whatever may be said of their character and ,
savage propensity, of the difficulties of introducing r
among them the habits of civilized life, and the obÂ­ t
stacles they have offered to the progress of settling t
in certain parts the country, the IndlÂ­ s
ans are certainly entitled to our sympathy B
and to a conscientious respect on our part for their e
claims upon our sense of justice. They were the ,
aboriginal occupants of the land we now possess; c
they have been driven from place to place; the purÂ­ c
chase money paid to them in some cases for what c
they called their own has still left them poor; in f
many instances when they had settled down upon
land assigned to them by compact, and begun to supÂ­
port themselves by their own labor, they were rudely
jostled off and thrust into the wilderness again.
Many, if not most all, our Indian wars have had i
their origin in broken promises and acts of injustice
on our part, and the advance of Indians in civilizaÂ­
tion has been slow because the treatment they reÂ­
ceived did not permit it to be faster and more genÂ­
eral. We cannot expect them to improve and
follow our guidance unless we keep faith with
them in respecting the rights they possess; and unÂ­
less, instead of depriving them of their opportunities,
we lend them a helping hand. I cordially approve
the policy regarding the management of Indian afÂ­
fairs outlined in the reports of the Secretary of the
Interior, and of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs.
The faithful performance of our promises is the first
condition of a good understanding with the Indians.
I cannot too urgently recommend to Congress that
prompt and liberal provision be made for the conÂ­
scientious fulfillment of all agreements entered into
by the government with Indian tribes. To withhold
the means necessary for the performance of a
promise is always false economy, and is apt to prove
disastrous in its consequences. Especial care is
recommended to provide for Indians settled on their
reservation, such as by furnishing cattle and
agricultural implements to aid them in whatever efÂ­
forts they may make to support themselves, and
by the reestablishment and maintenance of schools
to bring them under the control of civilized intluÂ­
ences. I see no reason why Indians who can give
satisfactory proof of having by their own labor supÂ­
ported their families for a number of years, and who
are willing to detach themselves from their tribal reÂ­
lations, should not be admitted to the benefits of the
homestead act, and the privileges of citizenship, and
I recommend the passage of a law to that effect. It
will be an act of justice as welias a measure of enÂ­
couragement. Earnest efforts ame being made to puÂ­
rify the Indian Service so that every dollar approÂ­
priated by Congress shall redound to the benefit of
the Indian. The efforts will have my firm support.
With an improved service and every possible enÂ­
couragement held out to the Indians to better their
condition and to elevate them in the scale of civilizaÂ­
tion we may hope to do at the same time a good work
for them and for ourselves.
PRESERVING UIILIC TIMBER.
I invite the attention of Congress to the importÂ­
ance of the statements and suggestions by the SecÂ­
retary of the Interior concerning the depredations
committed upon the timber lands of the United
States and the necessity for the preservation of forÂ­
ests. It is believed that the measures taken in purÂ­
suance of the existing law to arrest these depredaÂ­
tions will be entirely successful if Congress by an apÂ­
propriation for that purpose renders their continued
enforcement possible. The experience of other naÂ­
tions teaches us that a countrjÂ­ cannot be stripped of
its forests with impunity, and we shall expose ourÂ­
selves to the gravest consequences unless the wasteÂ­
ful and improvident manner which the forests in the
United States are destroyed be effectually checked.
I earnestly recommend that the measures
suggested by the Secretary of the Interior for the
suppression of depredations on the public timber

 lauds of the United States for the selling of timber F
from the public lands, and for the preservation of F
forests, be embodied in law, and that, considering F
the urgent necessity of enabling the people of certain F
states and territories to purchase timber from the
public lands in a legal manner, which at present they
cannot do, such a law be passed without unavoidable F
delay.
BARREN LAND.
I would also call the attention of Congress to a F
statement made by the Secretary of the Interior conÂ­
cerning the disposition that might be made of the
desert lands not irrigatable, west of the one hundreth I
meridian. These lands are practically unsalable unÂ­
der the existing laws, and the suggestion is worthy
of consideration, that a system of lease would make
them a source of profit to the United States, while at
the same time legalizing the business of cattle-raisÂ­
ing, which is at present carried on upon them. '
THE HARVEST. '
The report of the Commissioner of Agriculture
contains the gratifying announcement of the extraÂ­ 'I
ordinary success which has rewarded the agriculÂ­
tural industry of the country for the past year. 'I
With the fair prices which obtain for the products of
the soil, especially for the surplus which our people
have to export, we may confidently turn to this as
the most important of all our resources for the reÂ­
vival of the depressed industries of the country. S
The report shows our agricultural progress during $
the year and contains a statement of the work done
by this department for the advancement of agriculÂ­ c
tural industry, upon which the prosperity of our r
people ,o largely depends. Matters of information h
are included of great interest to all who seek by the s
experience of others to improve their own methods $
of cultivation. The effoits of the (lepartment a
increase the production of important artiÂ­ a
cles of consumption, and it is hoped n
will improve the demand for labor and a
advance the business of the country and eventually r
result in saving some of the many millions that are y
now annually paid to foreign nations for sugar and
other staple products which habitual use has made t
necessary in our every-day life. r
CENTENNIAL REPORT.
The Board in behalf of the Executive Departments a
on the International Exposition of 1876 has concluded c1
its labors. The final report of the Board was transÂ­ a
mitted to Congress by the last session. As these paÂ­ r
pers contain interesting and valuable information,
and will constitute the only report emanating from t
the government on the subject of 'the exhibition, I r
will invite attention to the matter and recommend r
that the report bhe published for general information. d
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. a
Congress is empowered by the Constitution with c
the authority of exclusive legislation over the DisÂ­ ii
trictof Columbia in which the seat of government 11
of the nation is located. The interests of the DisÂ­
trict, having no direct representation in Congress, t
are entitled to especial consideration and care at the c
hands of the general government. The Capital of r
the United States belongs to the nation, and it is c
natural that the American people should take pride
in the seat of their national government and desire
it to be an ornament to the country. Much has been a
done to render it healthful, convenient and attracÂ­ -
tive,.but much remains to be clone, which its perÂ­
manent inhabitants are not able and ought not to be
expectedto do. To impose upon them the outlay
required for public improvements, which are in a
great measure planned and executed for the convenÂ­
ience of the government and of the many thousands
of visitors from all parts of tile country, who
temporarily reside in the Capital of the nation, is an
edvient injustice. Special attention is asked by the
Commissioners of the District, in their report, which
is herewith transmitted, to the importance of a perÂ­ F
manent adjustment by Congress of the linancial reÂ­
lations between the United States and the District,
involving the regular annual contribution lby the
United States of its just proportion of the expenses
of the District government, of the outlay of all needÂ­
ed public improvements and such measure of relief F
from the burden of taxation now resting on the
people of the District as in the wisdom of Congress F
may be deemed just. The report of the CommissionÂ­
ers shows that the affairs of tie District are in a conÂ­ F
dition as satisfactory as could he expected, in view
of the heavy debt resting thereupon and its verylimÂ­ F
ited means for the necessary expensesthe debtof the
District is as follows: Funded debt SS,357-,691.96; 3.85 F
bonds guaranteed by the United States, $13,743,2530;
total bonded debt, $22,122,941.96; to which should be F
added certain outstanding claims as explained in
the report of the Commissioners-$11S,220,452, makÂ­
ing the total debt of the District, 523,310,146.4S. The
Connnissioners also ask attention to the importance
of the improvement of the Potomac River and the
reclamation of the marshes bordering on the City of e
Washington, and their views upon this subject are
concurred in by the members of the Board of
Health, whose report is also herewith transmitted.
BOJth the commercial and sanitary interests of the
District will be greatly promoted, I doubt not, by this
improvement. Your attention is invited to the suggesÂ­
tion of the Commissioners and of the Board of
Health, for the organization of a Board of Charities
to have supervision and control of the disbursement
of all moneys for charitable purposes fronm tile DisÂ­
trict treasury. I desire also to ask your especial atÂ­
tention to the need of adding to the efficiency of
the public schools of the District by a supplemental F
appropriation, aid from tihe national treasury. This
is especially just since so large a number of those
attending schools are children of employes of the
Government. I earnestly commend to your care
the interests of the people of the District who are so
intimately associated with the government estabÂ­
lishments, and to whose enterprise the good order
and attractiveness of the Capital are largely due,and
I ask your attention to the request of the CommisÂ­
sioners for legislation in behalf of the interests enÂ­
trusted to their care. The appropriations asked for
the care of reservations belonging to the government F
within their charge by the Commissioners of Public
Buildings and Grounds are also commendled to your
favorable consideration.
The report of the Joint Commission created biy the
act approved August 2, 1176, an act providing for the -
completion of the Washiugton monument, is also
herewith transmitted, with accompanying docuÂ­ tl
ments. The board of engineer ofllcers detailed to tl
examine the monumnent, in compliance with ri
the second section of the act, have reported 5
that the foundation is insullclent. No authority n
exists for making the expenditure necessary to ti
secure its stability. I therefore recommend that the 8
Commission be authorized to expenld such portion 4
of the sum appropriated by the act as may be necesÂ­
sary for the purpose. The present unfinished condiÂ­


LtUlu 01 IIU IIUIUIt.11, UKguu so iou101g ago, is a reÂ­ i
proach to the nation. It cannot be doubted that the F
patriotic sense of the country will mainly respond to F
such prompt provision as may be made for its comÂ­ F
pletion at an early day, and I urge upon Congress F
the propriety and necessity of immediate legislation
for this purpose. F
EDUCATIONAL.
The wisdom of legislation upon the part of ConÂ­ F
gress in aid of the States for education of the whole F
people in those branches of study which are taught
in the common schools of the country is no longer a F
question. The intelligent judgment of the country
goes still further regarding it, as also both constituÂ­ F
tional and expedient for the general government to I
extend to technical and higher education such aid as F
is deemed essential to the general welfare, and to
our due prominence among the enlightened and culÂ­
tivated nations of the world. The ultimate settleÂ­
ment of all questions of the future, whether of adÂ­ r
ministration or finance, or of true nationality of selÂ­ a
timent, depends upon the virtue and intelligence of I
the people. It is vain to hope for the I
success of a free government without the J
means of insuring the intelligence I
of those who are the source of power. No less than i
one seventh of the entire voting population of our 1
country are yet unable to read and write. It is enÂ­ I
couraging to observe in connection with the growth I
of fraternal feeling in those States in which slavery I
formerly existed evidences of increasing interest in
uinive'sal education, and I shall be glad to give my
approval to any appropriate measures which may be
enacted by Congress for the purpose of supplementÂ­
ing with national aid the local systems of education
in these States, and in all the States. Having already I
invited your attention to the needs of the District of 3
Columbia with respect to its public school I
system, I here add that I believe it deÂ­
sirable, not so much with reference to the
local wants of the District, but the great and lasting
benefit of the entire country, that this system should
be crowned with a university in all respects in keepÂ­
ing with the national capital, and thereby realize the
cherished hopes of Washington on this subject. I
also earnestly commend the request of the Regents
of the Smithsonian Institute that an adequate approÂ­
priation be made for the conduct of a national m0uÂ­
seum under their supervision. r
The subject of providing for preservation and a
growth of the library of Congress is also one of naÂ­ '
tional importance. As the depositary of copyright ]
publications and records, this library has out-grown J
the provisions for its accommodation, and the erecÂ­ 3
tion on such site as the judgment of Congress may I
approve, of a fire-proof library building to preserve I
the treasures and enlarge the usefulness of this valÂ­ I
uable collection, is recommended.
I recommend, also, such legislation as will render
available and efficient for the purpose of instruction,
so far as consistent with the public service, the
cabinets or museums of invention, of surgery, of
education and of agriculture and other collections, I
the property of the National Government.
The capital of the nation should be something f
more than amere political center. We should avail t
ourselves of all the opportunity which providence t
has placed at our command to commit the general
intelligence of the people and increase the conditions c
most favorable to the success and perpetuity of its c
institutions. (Signed) R. B. HAYESS.
December 3, 1877","unknown"
"682","3690656","But the Constitution has not only conferred
these high powers upon Congress, but it has adoptÂ­
ed effectual means to restrain the States from inÂ­
terfering with their exercise. For that purpose
it has, in strong prohibitory language, expressly
declared that ""no State shall enter into any treaty,
alliance, or confederation ; grant letters of marque
and reprisal ; coin money ; emit bills of credit;
make anything but gold and silver coin a tender
in payment of debts; pass any bill of attainder,
ex post facto law, or law impairing the obligation
of contracts."" Moreover, ""without the consent
of Congress, no State shall lay any imposts or duÂ­
ties on any imports or exports, except what may
be absolutely necessary for executing its inspecÂ­
tion laws ;"" and, if they exceed this amount, the
excess shall belong to the United States.
And ""no State shall, without the consent of
Congress, lay any duty of tonnage; keep troops,
or ships of war, in time of peace; enter into any
agreement or compact with another State, or with
a foreign power; or engage in war, unless actually
invaded, or in such imminent danger as will not
admit of delay.""
In order still further to secure the uninterruptÂ­
ed exercise of these high powers against State inÂ­
terposition, it is provided ""that this Constitution
and the laws of the United States which shall be
made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made,
or which shall be made, under the authority of
the United States, shall be the supreme law of the
land; and the judges in every Stateshall be bound
thereby, anything in the Constitution or laws of
any State to the contrary notwithstanding.""
The solemn sanction of religion has been suÂ­
peradded to the obligations of official duty, and all
senators and representatives of the United States,
all members of State legislatures, and all execuÂ­
tive and judicial officers, ""both of the United
States and of the several States, shall be bound'by
oath or affirmation to support this Constitution.""
In order to carry into effect these powers, the
3 Constitution has established a perfect Government
in all its forms, Legislative, Executive, and JudiÂ­
cial ; and this Government, to the extent of its
powers, acts directly upon the individual citizens
of every State, and executes its own decrees by
I the agency of its own officers. In this respect it
differs entirely from the Government under the
old Confederation, which was confined to making
requisitions on the States in their sovereign charÂ­
acter. This left it in the discretion of each whethÂ­
1 er to obey or to refuse, and they often declined to
comply with such requisitions. It thus became
necessary, for the purpose of removing this barÂ­
e rier, and ""in order to form a more perfect Union,""
to establish a Government which could act directÂ­
f ly upon the people, and execute its own laws withÂ­
t out the intermediate agency of the States. This
I has been accomplished by the Consti:,ution of the
1 United States.
In short, the Government created by the ConÂ­
- stitution, and deriving its nathority from the sovÂ­
e ereign people of each of the several States, has
precisely the same right to exercise its power over
the people of all these States. in the enumerated
a cases, that each one of them possesses over subjects
e not delegated to the United States but ""reserved
to the States, respectively, or to the people.""
To the extent of the delegated powers the ConÂ­
, stitution of the United States is as much a part of
the Constitution of each State, and is as binding
upon its people, as though it haild been textually
h inserted therein.
o This Government, therefore, is a great and powÂ­
a erful Government, invested with all the attributes
e of sovereignty over the special subjects to which
n its authority extends. Its framers never intended
n to implant in its bosom the seeds of its own deÂ­
f struction, nor were they at its creation guilty of
the absurdity of providing for its own dissolution.
ii It was not intended by its framers to be the baseÂ­
less faibric of a vision which, at the touch of the
i enchanter, would vanish into thin air, but a subÂ­
e stantial and mighty fabric, capable of resistingthe
e slow decay of time and of defying the storms of
d ages. Indeed, welt may the jealous patriots of
c that day have indulged fears that agovernment of
.r such high powers might violate the reserved rights
is of the States, and wisely did they adopt the rule
h of a strict construction of these powers to prevent
i the danger! But they did not fear, nor had they
I any reason to imagine, that the Constitution
Swould ever be so interpretted as to enable any
v State by her own act, and without the consent of
f her sister States, to discharge her people from all
or any of their Federal obligations.
i It may he asked, then, are the people of the
States without redress against the tyranny and
I oppression of the Federal Governmcnt? By no
means. The right of resistance on the part of the
1 governed against the oppression of their governÂ­
ments cannot be denied. It exists independently
e of all Constitutions, and lhas been exercised at all


periods of the world's history. Under it old govÂ­
crnments have been destroyed, and new ones have
a taken their place. It isembodied in strong and exÂ­
press language in our own Declaration of IndepenÂ­
a dence. But the distinction must ever be observed,
n
that this is revolution against an established GovÂ­
es ernment, and not a voluntary secession from it
o by virtue of an inherent constitutional right. In
r short, let us look the danger fairly in the face : SeÂ­
t cession is neither more nor less than revolution.
It may or it may not be a justifiable revolution,
e but still it is revolution.
g
What, in the mean time, is the responsibility
e and true position of the Executive ? He is bound
d by solemn oath before God and the country ""to
t, take care that the laws be faithfully executed,""
and from this obligation he cannot be absolved by
any human power. But what if the performance
mt of this duty, in whole or in part, has been renderÂ­
sÂ­
ed impracticable by events over which he could
iÂ­
have exercised no control? Such, at the present
e moment, is the case throughout the State of South
IÂ­ Carolina, so far as the laws of the United States
f to secure the administration of justice by means
d
of the Federal Judiciary are concerned. All the
n
Federal officers within its limits, through whose
.e agency alone these laws can be carried into exeÂ­
g cution, have already resigned. We no longer
1Â­
have a districtjudge, a district attorney, or a marÂ­
h shal in South Carolina. In fact the whole maÂ­
chinery of the Federal Government, necessary for
i the distribution of remedial justice among the
people, has been demolished; and it would be difÂ­
I tlicult, if not impossible, to replace it.
The only acts of Congress on the statute-book,
n
bearing upon this subject, are those of the 28th
f, February, 1795, and 3d March, 1807. These auÂ­
al
thorize the President, after he shall have ascerÂ­
d tained that the marshal with his posse eomiiituis
.d is unable to execute civil or criminal process in
any particular case, to call forth the militia and
o employ the army and navy to aid him in perÂ­
: forming this service, having first by Proclamation
- commanded the insurgents ""to disperse and retire
st
peaceably to their respective abodes, within a limÂ­
'y
ied time."" This duty cannot by possibility be
- performed in a State where no judicial authority
exists to issue process, and where there is no marÂ­
s, shal to execute it, and where, even if there were
ni such an officer, the entire population would codn
)f
stitute one solid combination to resist him.
me
The bare enumeration of these provisions
sÂ­
proves how inadequate they are without further
legislation to overcome a united opposition in a
It single State, not to speak of othea States who may
s; place themselves in a similar attitude. Congress
al alone has power to decide whether the present
laws can or cannot be amended so as to carry out
)e more effectually the objects of the Constitution.
1Â­
The same insuperable obstacles do not lie in the
aÂ­
way of executing the laws for the collection of
d the customs. The revenue still continues to be
to
collected, as heretofore, at the custom-house in
iÂ­ Charleston; and should thecollector unfortunately
)Â­
resign, a successor may he appointed to perform
me
this duty.
of
Then in' regard to the property of the United
ie States in South Carolina. This has been purÂ­
- chased for a fair equivalent, ""by the consent of the
legislature of the State,""-""for the erection of forts,
ct magazines, arsenals,"" &c., and over these the auÂ­
of thority ""to exercise exclusive legislation"" has been
expressly granted by the Constitution to ConÂ­

 gress. It is not believed that any attempt willhe t
made to expel the United' States from this propÂ­ s
erty by force; but if in this I should prove to be r
mistaken, the officer in command of the forts has h
received orders to act strictlyon thedefensive. In (
such a contingency, the responsibility for conseÂ­ I
quences would rightifully rest upon the heads of t
the assailants.
Apart from the execution of the laws, so far as
this may be practicable, the Executive has no auÂ­ s
thority to decide what shall be the relations beÂ­
tween the federal government and South CaroliÂ­ c
na. He has been invested with no such discreÂ­ a
tion. He possesses no power to change the relaÂ­ s
tions heretofore existing between them, much loss t
to acknowledge the independence of that State. V
This would be to invest a mere Executive officer
with the power of recognising
"" the dissolution of <
the Confederacy among our thirty-three sovereign (
States. It bears no resemblance to the rec6gniÂ­
tion of a foreign de facto government, involving I
no such responsibility. Any attempt to do this e
would, on hispart, boa naked act'of usurpation.
It is, therefore, my duty to submit to Congress <
the whole question in all its bearings. The course (
of events is so rapidly hastening forward, that the i
emergency may soon arise, when you may be callÂ­ t
ed upon to decide the momentous question whethÂ­
er you posess the power, by force of arms, to
compel a State to remain in the Union. I should
feel myself recreant to my duty were I not to cxÂ­ I
press an opinion on this important subject.
The question fairly stated is: Has the ConstiÂ­
tution delegated to Congress the power to coerce
a State into submission which is attempting to
withdraw or has actually withdrawn from the
Confederacy? If answered in the affirmative, it
must be on the principle that the power has been
conferred upon Congress to declare and to make
war against a State. After much serious reflecÂ­
tion I have arrived at the conclusion that. no such
power has been delegated to Congress or to any
other department of the Federal Government. It
is manifest, upon an inspection oftheConstitution,
that this is not among the specific and enumerÂ­
ated powers granted to Congress; and it is equalÂ­
ly apparent that its exercise is not ""necessary and
proper for carrying into execution"" any one of
these poa\ers. So far from this power having
been delegated to Congress, it was expressly reÂ­
fused by the convention which framed the ConÂ­
stitution.
It appears, from the proceedings of that body,
that on the 3lstof May, 1787, the clause, ""authorÂ­
iizng ans xertion qof the force of the uwhole against
a delinquent State"" came up for consideration.
Mr. Madison opposed it in a brief but powerful
speech, from which I shall extract but a single
sentence. He observed : ""The use of force
against a State would look more like a declaration
of war than an infliction of punishment; and
would probably be considered by the party atÂ­
tacked as a dissolution of all previous compacts by
which it might be bound."" Upon his motion the
clause was unanimously postponed, and was nevÂ­
er I believe again presented. Soon afterwards,
on the 8th of June, 1787, when incidentally adÂ­
verting to the subject, he said: ""Any GovernÂ­
ment for the United States, formed on the supÂ­
posed practicability of using force against the unÂ­
constitutional proceedings of the States, would
prove as visionary and fallacious as the GovernÂ­
ment of Congress,"" evidently meaning the then
existing Congress of the old Confederation.
Without descending to particulars, it may
be safely asserted, that the power to make war
against a State is at variance with the whole spirÂ­
it and intent of the Constitution. Suppose such
a war should result in the conquest of a State,
how are we to govern it afterwards? Shall we
hold it as a province, and govern it by despotic
power ? In the nature of things we could not, by
physical force, control the will of the people, and
i
compel thenm to elect senators and representatives
to Congress, and to perform all the other duties
I depending upon their own volition, and required
from the citizens of a free State as a constituent
I
member of the Confederacy.
But, if we possessed this power, would it be wise
to exercise it under existing circumstances? The
f object would doubtless be to preserve the Union.
War would not only present the most effectual
means of destroying it; but would banish all hope
of its peaceable reconstruction. Besides, in the
fraternalconflict, a vast amount of blood and
s
treasure would be expended, rendering filture
I reconciliation betweer the States impossible. In
I the mean time, who can foretell what would be
- the sufhirings and privations of the people during
f its existence?
The fact is, that our Union rests upon public
opinion and can never be cemented by the blood
of its citizens shed in civil war. If it cannot live
-
in the affections of the people, it must one day
perish. Congress possess many means of proÂ­
f serving it by conciliation, but the sword was not
f placed in their hand to preserveit by force.
f But may I be permitted solemnly to invoke
s
my countrymen to pause and deliberate, before
C
they determine to destroy this, the grandest tenmÂ­
Sple which has ever beetn dedicated to hunan
Sfreedom
since the world began? It ihas been
Sconsecrated
by the blood of our fathers, by the
Sglories
of the past, and by the hopes of the fitÂ­
ture. The Union has already made us the most
I prosperous and, er long, will,ifpreserved,render
us the most powerful nation on the face of the
Searth.
In every foreign region of the globe the
title of American citizen is held in the highest
respect, and when pronounced in a foreign land
Sit
causes thhe arts o om
or countrymnen to swell
-
with honest pride. Surely when we reachnd the
Sbrink
of the yawning abyss, we shall recoil withll
1 horror from the last fatal plunge. By such a


- dread catastrophe the lhopes of the friends of
freedom throughout the world would be destroyÂ­
ed, and a long night of leaden despotism would enÂ­
shroud the nations. Our example for more than
eighty years would not only be lost; but it would
be quoted as a conclusive proof that man is unfit
t for self-government.
It is not every wrong-nay, it is not every grievous
wrong-which can justify a resort to such a fearÂ­
ful alternative. This ought to be thelast desperÂ­
ate remedy of at despairing people, after every
other constitutional means of conciliation had
been exhausted. We should reflect that under
this free Government there is an incessant ebb
and flow in public opinion. The slavery quesÂ­
tion, like everything human, will have its day.
I firmly believe that it has already reached and
passed the culminating point. But if, in the
midst of the existing excitement, the Union
t shall perish, the evil may then become irreparaÂ­
ble. Congress can contribute much to avert it
byproposingandrecommendingtothelegislatures
s
of the several States the remedy for existing
s
evils, which the Constitution has itself provided
for its own preservation. This has been tried
at different critical periods of our history, and
always with eminent success. It is to be found
in the 5th article providing for its own amendÂ­
ment. Under this article amendments have
been proposed by two-thirds of both houses of
r
Congress, and have been ""ratified by the legislaÂ­
tures of three-fourths of theseveral States,"" and
have consequently become parts of the ConstituÂ­
tion. To this process the country is indebted
for the clause prohibiting Congress from passing
1
any law respecting an establishment of religion,
or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the
Spress, or of the right of petition. To this we
s
are, also, indebted for the Bill of Rights, which
1
secures the people against any abuse of power by
1
the Federal Government. Such were the appreÂ­
hensions justly entertained by the friends of
1
State-rights at that period as to have rendered
a
-it extremely doubtful whether the Constitution
could have long survived without these amendÂ­
s
ments.
Again, the Constitution was amended by the
same process after the election of President .JeoÂ­
e
ferson by the Iouse of Representatives, in FebÂ­
Sruary, 1803. This amendment was rendered neÂ­
cessary to prevent a recurrence of the dangers
s
which had seriously threatened the existence of
the Government during the pendency of that
election. The article for its own amendment was
y
intended to secure the amicable adjustment of conÂ­
s flicting constitutional questions like the present,
t which might arise between the governments of
t the States and that of the United States. This
appears from contemporaneous history. In this
a
connection, I shall merely call attention to a few
f sentences in Mr. Madison's justly celebrated reÂ­
a
port, in 1799, to the legislature of Virginia. In
I this he ably and conclusively defended the resoluÂ­
y
tions of the preceding legislature against the
strictures of several other State legislatures.Â­
These were mainly founded upon the protest of
1
the Virginia legislature against the "" Alien and
-
Sedition Acts,"" as ""palpable and alarming inÂ­
e
fractions of the Constitution."" In pointing out
the peaceful and constitutional remedies, and he
referred to none other, to which the States were
i
anthorised to resort, on such occasions, he
- concludes by saying, "" that the legislatures of

 the States might have made a direct repreÂ­ J(
sentation to Congress with a view to obtain a N
rescinding of the two offensive acts, or they might
have represented to their respective Senators in r
Congress their wish that two-thirds thereof would c
propose an explanatory amendment to the ConstiÂ­
tution. or two-thirds of themselves, if such had
beenr their option, might, by an application to
c
Congress, have obtained a convention for the t
same object.""
This is the very course which I earnestly reÂ­ e
commend in order to obtain an "" explanatory I
amendment"" of the Constitution on the subject of
slavery. This might originate with Congress or
the State legislatures, rC may be deemed most
advisable to attain the object.
The explanatory amendment might be confinÂ­
ed to the final settlement of the true construction
of the Constitution on three special points :
1. An express recognition of the right of proÂ­
perty in slaves in the States where it now exists
or may hereafter exist.
2. The duty of protecting this right in all the
common territories throughout their territorial
existence, and until they shall be admitted as
States into the Union, with or without slavery, as'
their constitutions may prescribe.
:3. A like recognition of the right of the masÂ­
ter to have his slave, who has escaped from one
State to another, restored and ""delivered up"" to
him, and of the validity of the fugitive slave law
enacted for this purpose, together with a declaraÂ­
tion that all State laws impairing or defeating
this right are violations of the Constitution, and
are consequently null and void.
It may be objected that this construction of the
Constitution has already been settled by the SuÂ­
preme Court of the United States, and what more
ought to be required? The answer is, that a very
large proportion of the people of the United States
still contest the correctness of this decision, and
never will cease from agitation and admit its
binding force until clearly establis the peoÂ­
ple of the States in their sover ter.Â­
Such an explanatory amendm is beÂ­
lieved, forever terminate the ions
and restore peace and harmon ates.
It ought not to be doubted tha appeal
to the arbitrament established by the onstitution
itself would be received with favor by all the
States of the Confederacy. In any event it ought
to be tried in a spirit of conciliation before any
of these States shall separate themselves from the
Union.
When 1 entered upon the duties of the presiÂ­
dential office, the aspect neither of our foreign
nor domestic affairs was at all satisfactory. We
w ere involved in dangerous complications with sevÂ­
eral nations, and two of our territories were in a
state of revolution against the government. A
Srestoration of the African slave trade had numerÂ­
ous and powerful advocates. Unlawful military
expeditions were countenanced by many of our
citizens, and were suffered, in defiance of the ofÂ­
forts of the government, to escape from our shores,
for the purpose of making war upon the unofÂ­
fending people of neighboring republics with
whom we were at peace. In addition to these
and other difficulties, we experienced a revulsion
in monetary affairs, soon after my advent to powÂ­
er, of unexampled severity and of ruinous conseÂ­
quences to all the great interests of the country.
When we take a retrospect of what was then our
condition and contrast this with its material prasÂ­
perity at the time of the late presidential election,
we have abundant reason to return our grateful
thanks to that merciful Providence which has
t
never forsaken us as a nation in all our past trials.
OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS.
GREAT BRITAIN.
Our relations with Great Britain are of the most
friendly character. Since the commnencement of
my administration, the two dangerous questions,
arising from the Clayton and Bulwer treaty and
1 from the right of search, claimed by the British
t government, have been amicably and honorably
adjusted.
The discordant constructions of the Clayton and
e Bulwer treaty between the two governments,
which, at different periods of the discussion, bore
a threatening aspect, have resulted in a final setÂ­
tlement entiely satisfactory to this government.
In my last annual message I informed Congress
that the British government had not then "" comÂ­
pleted treaty arrangements ""'ith the republics of
Honduras and Nicaragua, in pursuance of the unÂ­
derstanding between the two governmeuts. It
is, nevertheless, confidently expected that this
good work will ere long be accomnplished."" This
c confident expectation has since been fulfilled.Â­
d
Her Britanic Majesty concluded a treaty with
He onduras on the 28th November, 1859, and with
}
Nicaragua on the 28th August, 1860, relinquishÂ­
ing the Mosquito protectorate. Besides, by the
,I former, the Bay Islands ares recognised as a part
of the republio of lhondsuras. It may be obÂ­
served that the stipulations of these treaties conÂ­
form in every important particular to the amendÂ­
meents adopted by the Senate of the United States
to the treaty concluded at London on the 17th
SOctober. 185t
, betwin tl, two governments. It
will be recollected thmet this treaty was rejected by
Sthe British government because of its objection
to the just and important amendment of the SenÂ­
ato to the article relating to Ruatan and the other
islands in the Bay of Honduras.
It must be a source of sincere satisfction to all
classes of our follow-citizens, and especially to
d those engaged in foreign commerce, that the
Sclaim, on the part of Great Britain, forcibly to
visit and search American merchant vensels on
the high seas in time of peace, has boeen obandonÂ­
ed. This was by far the mostdangerous question


to t.ue peace of tne two countries wicll has existÂ­
ed since the war of 1812. Whilst it remained
open, they might at any moment have been preÂ­
cipitated into a war. This was rendered manifest
by the exasperated state of public feeling throughÂ­
it
out our entire country, produchd by the forcible
search of American merchant vessels by British
cruisers on the coast of Cuba, in the spring of
s 1858. The American people hailed with general
acclaim the orders of the Secretary of the Navy
to our naval force in the Gulf of Mexico, ""to
S
protect all vessels of the United States on the
d high seas from search or detention by the vesselsÂ­
r of-war of any other nation."" These orders might
b have produced an immediate collision between
the naval forces of the two countries. This was
most fortunately prevented by an appeal to the
d justice of Great Britain and to the law of nations
0 as expounded by her own most eminent jurists.
n
The only question of any importance which
still remains open is the disputed title between the
t two governments to the island of San Juan, in
;s
the vicinity of Washington Territory. As this
g
question is still under negotiation, it is not deemÂ­
ed advisable at the present moment to make any
d
other allusion to the subject.
d
The recent visit of the Prince of Wales, in a
d
private character, to the people of this country,
Shas proved to be a most auspicious event. In its
e consequences, it cannot fail to increase the kindred
f and kindly feelings which I trust may ever actuÂ­
' ate the government and people of both countries
d in their political and social intercourse with each
- other.
d FRANEx.
g With France, our ancient and powerful ally,
our relations continue to be of the most friendly
character. A decision has recently been made by
a French judicial tribunal, with the approbation
of the Imperial Government, which cannot fail
to foster the sentiments of mutual regard that have
so long existed between the two countries. UnÂ­
der the French law no person can .serve in the
armies of France unless he be a French citizen.
The law of France recognising the natural right
ofexpatriation, it follows as a necessary consequence
that a Frenchman, by the fact of having become
a citizen of the United States, has changed his alleÂ­
giance and has lost his native character. Hecannot,
therefore, be compelled to serve in the French
armies in case he should return to his native counÂ­
.f try. These principles were announced in 1852
it by the French Minister of ""War, and in two late
s cases have been confirmed by the French judiciaÂ­
ry. In these, two natives of 'rance have been
t discharged from the French army because they
had become American citizens. To employ the
is language of our present minister to France, who
is has rendered good service on this occasion, "" I do
not think our French naturalized fellow-citizens
will hereafter experience much annoyance on this
subject."" I venture to predict that the time is not
far distant when the other continental powers will
e adopt the same wise and just policy which has
done so much honor to the enlightened govern.
ment of the Emperor. In any event, our govÂ­
d
ernment is bound to protect the rights of our nat.
uralized citizens everywhere to the same extent
as though they had drawn their first breath in
e this country. We can recognise no distinction
between our native and naturalized citizens.
e RUSSIA.
f Between the great empire of Russia and the

 United States the.mutual friendship and regard
which has so long existed still continues to pre.
vail, and, if possible, to increase. Indeed, our
relations with that Empire are all that we could
desire.
SPAIN.
Our relations with Spain are now of a more
complicated though less dangerous character than
they have been for many years. Our citizens
have long held, and continue to hold, numerous
claims against the Spanish government. These
had been ably urged for a series of years by our
successive diplomatic representatives at Madrid,
but without obtaining redress. The Spanish
government finally agreed to institute a joint
commission for the adjustment of these claims,
and on the 5th day of March, 1860, concluded a
convention for this purpose 3with our present
minister at Madrid. Under this convention,
what have been denominated ""the Cuban
clainis,"" amounting to S128,635 and 54 cents, in
which more than one hundred of our fellow-citiÂ­
zens are interested, were recognized, and the
Spanish government agreed to pay $100,000 of
this amount '""within three months following the
exchange of ratifications."" The payment of the
remaining $28,635 54 was to await the decision
of the commissioners for or against ""the Amistad
claiui ;"" but in any event the balance was to be
paid to the claimants either by Spain or the
UTnited States. These terms I have every reaÂ­
son to know are highly satisfactory to the holdÂ­
ers of the Cuban claims. Indeed, they have
made a formal offer authorizing the State DeÂ­
partment to settle these claims, and to deduct
the amount of the Amistad claim from the sums
which they are entitled to receive from Spain.
This offer, of course, cannot be accepted.
All other claims of citizens of the United States
against Spain, or of subjects of the Queen of
Spain against the United States, including the
""Amistad claim,"" were by this convention reÂ­
ferred to a board of commissioners in the usual
form. Neither the validity of the Amistad
claim nor of any other claim against either party,
with the single exception of the Cuban claims,
was recognised by the convention. Indeed, the
Spanish government did not insist that the vaÂ­
lidity of the Amistad claim should be thus recogÂ­
nised, notwithstanding its payment had been
recommended to Congress by two of my predeÂ­
cessors as well as by myself, and an appropriaÂ­
tion for that purpose had passed the Senate of the
United States. They were content that it should
be submitted to the board for examination and
decision, like the other claims. Both governÂ­
ments were bound respectively to pay the
amounts awarded to the several claimants ""at
such times and places as may be fixed by and acÂ­
cording to the tenor of said awards.""
I transmitted this convention to the Senate
for their constitutional action on the 3d May,
1860, and on the 27th of the succeeding June
they determined that they would ""not advise
and consent"" to its ratification.
These proceedings place our relations with
I Spain in an awkward and embarrassing position.
It is more than probable that the final adjustÂ­
ment of these claims will devolve upon my sucÂ­
cessor.
I reiterate the recommendation contained in
my Annual Message of December, 1858, and
r
repeated in that of December, 1859, in favor of
the acquisition of Cuba from Spain by fair purÂ­
1 chase. I firmly believe that such an acquisition
I would contribute, essentially to the well-being
and prosperity of both countries in all future
time, as well as prove the certain means of imÂ­
mediately abolishing the African slave-trade
throughout the world. I would not repeat this
accommendation upon the present occasion, if I
believed that the transfer of Cuba to the United
States, upon conditions highly favorable to Spain,
could justly tarnish the national honor of the
h
proud and ancient Spanish Monarchy. Surely
no person ever attributed to the first Napoleon a
Y
disregard of the national honor of France, for
d transferring Louisana to the United States for a
fair equivalent both in money and commercial
advantages.
AUSTRIA, &C.
With the Emperor ofAustria, and the remainÂ­
ing continental powers of Europe, including that
s of the Sultan, our relations continue to be of the
most friendly character.
CHINA.
t The friendly and peaceful policy pursued by the
Government of the United States towards the
Is empire of 'China has produced the most satisfacÂ­
tory results. The treaty of Tientsin of the 18th
of June, 1858, has been faithfully observed by
the Chinese authorities. The convention of the
8th November, 1858,supplementary to this treaty,
for the adjustment and satisfaction of the
e claims of our citizens on China, referred to in my
last Annual Message, has been already carried inÂ­
to effect, so far as this was practicable.
Unaer this convention the sum of 500,000 tacls
equal to about $700,000, was stipulated to be
paid in satisfaction of the claims of American
t citizens out of the one-fifth of the receipts for tonÂ­
nage import, and export duties on American
Svessels at the ports of Canton, Shanghae, and
n IFuchau; and it was ""agreed that this amount
shall be in full liquidation of all claims of AmerÂ­
a ican citizens at the various ports to this date.""
Debentures for. this amount-to wit: 300,000
taels for Canton,100,000 for Shanghne, and 100,Â­
o 000 for Fuchau-wero delivered according to the
0 terms of the convention by the respective Chinese
o collectors of the customs of these ports to the
n agent selected by our minister to receive the same.
Since that t.me the claims of our citizens have


been adjusted by the board of commissioners apÂ­
d pointed for that purpose under the act of March
3, 1859, and their awards, which proved satisfacÂ­
tory to the claimants, have been approved by our
minister. In the aggregate they amount to the
Ssum of 498,694 78. The claimants have alreaÂ­
hdy received a large proportion of the sums awardÂ­
ed to them out of the fund provided, and it is
d1
confidently expected that the remainder will ere
long be entirely paid. After the awards shall
y have been satisfied, there will remain a surplus
to
of more than $200,000 at the disposition of ConÂ­
IC
gress. As this will in equity belong to the ChiÂ­
nose government, would not justice require its
appropriation to some benevolent object in which
n the Chinese may be specially interested?
iS
Our minister to China, in obedience to his inÂ­
e structions, has remained perfectly neutral in the
s war between Great Britain and France and the
h Chlnese empire; although, in conjunction with
the Russian minister, he was ever ready and
1C
willing, had the opportunity offered, to employ
n his good offices in restoring peace between the
s parties. It is but an act of simple justice, both to
our present minister and his predecessor, to state,
y that they have proved fully equal to the delicate,
trying, and responsible positions in which they
have on different occasions been placed.
JAPAN.
d The ratifications of the treaty with Japan, conÂ­
eluded at Yedo on the 29th July, 1858, were exÂ­
,s changed at Washington on the 22d of May last,
h and the treaty itself was pi oclaimed on the sucÂ­
ceeding day. There is good reason to expect that,
under its protection and influence, our trade and
intercourse with that distant and interesting peoÂ­
ple will rapidly increase.
y
The ratifications ot' the treaty were exchanged
y with unusual solemnity. For this purpose the TyÂ­
n
coon hadaccredited three of his most distinguished
subjects as envoys extraordinary and ministers
o plenipotentiary, who were received and treated
with marked distinction and kindness both by.the
e Government and people of the United States.Â­
There is every reason to believthat they have reÂ­
turned to their native land entirely satisfied with
their visit, and inspired by the most friendly feelÂ­
ings for our country. Let us ardently hope, in
the language of the treaty itself, that ""there shall
h
henceforward, be perpetual peace and friendship
between the United' States of America and his
[Majesty the Tycoon of Japan and his successors.""
e BRAZIL.
With the wise, conservative, and liberal govÂ­
erhment of the empire of Brazil our relations ejnÂ­
tinue to be of the most amicable character.
NEW GRANADA.
0 The exchange of the ratifications of the convenÂ­
o tion with the republic of New Granada, signed at
Â°
Washington on the 10th September, 1857, has
been long delayed from accidental causes, for
which neither party is censurable. These ratificaÂ­
Stions were duly exchanged in this city on the 5th
of November last. Thus has a controversy been
amicably terminated which had become snserious
at the period of my inauguration, as to require
me, on the 17th of April. 1857, to direct our minÂ­
ister to demand his passports and return to dhp
United States.
Under this convention the government of New.
n
Granada has specially acknowledged itself to be
responsible to our citizens ""for damages which
were caused by the riot at Pianama on the 5th of
e April, 1856."" These claims, together with other

 claims of our citizens which had been
l ur e
in vain, are referred for adjustment
to ag uPrgea
commissioners. I submit a copy of th bordof
tion to Congross, and recommend the Ionen
necessary to carry it into oeffect.

turn soon compelled to retire and give place to
General Miramon.
Under the constitution which had thus beei
adopted, Senor Juarez, as chief justice of the Su.
preme Court, became the lawful President of the
Republic; and it was for, the maintenance of the
constitution nd ahis authority derived from it that
the civil war commenced, and still continues to
be prosecuted.
Throughout the year 1858 the constitutional
party grew stronger and stronger. In the previ.
Sous history of Mexico a successful military revo.
lution at the capital had almost universally been
the signal for submission throughout the republic,
Not so on the present occasion. A mnjorityof the
citizens persistently sustained the constitutional
government. When this was recognized in
April, 1859, by the government if the United
f
States, its authority extended over a large umajori.
ty of the Mexican States and people, including
Vera Cruz and all the other important sea ports
of the republic. From that period our commerce
e with Mexico began to revive, and' the constituÂ­
tional government has afforded it all the protecÂ­
tion in their power.
Meanwhile, the government of Miramon still
I held sway at the capital and over the surroundin,

few American citizens who still had thecoutge
e
to remain within its power. To cap the climax:
After the battleof Tacubaya, in April, 1859, Gun.
I
Marquez ordered three citizens of the United
r States, two of them physicians, to be seized in the
hospital at that place, taken out and shot, without
crime and without trial. This was done, notwith.
standing our unfortunate countrymen were at the
moment engaged in the holy cause of affording reÂ­
lief to the soldiers of both parties who had been
t wounded in the battle, without making any di-.
a
tinction between them.
The time had arrived, in my opinion, when thil
Government was bound to exert its power to
e avenge and redress the wrongs of our citizens and
e
to afford them protection in Mexico. The interÂ­
posing obstacle was that the portion of the coun.
try under the sway of Miramon could i ot be
reached without passing over territory under the
a jurisdiction of the constitutional government.Â­
hUnder these circumstances, I deemed it my duty
to recommend to Congress. in my last annual
Y
message, the employment of a sufficient military
force to penetrate into the interior, where the
government of M-iramon was to be found, with,
or, if need be, without the consent of the Juarea
e government, though it was not doubted that this
consent could be obtained. Never have 1 had
- a clearer conviction on any subject than of the
j justice as well as wisdom of such ai policy. -No
a
other alternative was left, except the entire abaunÂ­
t donment of our fellow citizens who hd gone to
Mexico, under the faith. of treaties, to the systemÂ­
Satic injustice, cruelty, and oppression of Miruamou's
o government. Besides, itis almost certain that the
simple authority to employ this force would of itÂ­
e self have accomplished sill our objects without
e striking a single blow. The constitutional govÂ­
e ernment would then ere this have been establislÂ­
ed at the city of Mexico, and would hlave been
Sready
and willing, to the extent of its ability, to


Sao us jusluce.
h
In addition-and I deem this a most important
consideration-European governments would have
r been deprived ot all pretext to interfere in the
e territorial and domestic concerns of Mexico. We
should thus have been relieved front the obligaÂ­
- tion of resisting, even by force, should this hbeÂ­
s come necessary, any attempt by these governments
e to deprive our neighboring republic of portions of
. her territory; a duty from which we could not
a shrink without abandoning the traditional and
established policy of the American people. 1. am
happy to observe, that, firmly relying upon the
ajustice and good faith of these governments, thereÂ­
ih
is no present danger that such a contingency will
happen.
Having discovered that my recoulmmedations
e would not be sustained by Congress, the next alÂ­
e
ternative was to accomplish, in some degree, if
h possible, the same objects by treaty stipulations
a with the constitutional government. Such treaÂ­
ties were accordingly concluded by our late able
e and excellent minister to Mexico, and on the 4th
o January last were submitted to the Senate for ratÂ­
ification. As these have not yet received the final
action of that body, it would be improper for ume
to present a detailed statement of their provisions.
Still I may be permitted to express the opinion iii
advance that they are calculated to promote the
agricultural, manufacturing, and commercial inÂ­
terests of the country,and to secure'our just infuÂ­
ence with an adjoining republic as to whose forÂ­
tunes and fate we can never feel indiflbrent;
whilst at the same time they provide for the payÂ­
ment of a considerable amount towards the satisÂ­
faction of the claims of our injured fellow-citizensÂ­

At the period of my inauguration I was conÂ­
fronted in Kansas by a revolutionary governÂ­
Sment existing under what is called the Topeka
constitution. Its avowed object was to Pubdue thie
territorial government by force, and toinaugurate
e
what wascalledthe Topeka government inits stead.
. To accomplish this object an extensive military
organization was formed and its command enÂ­
trusted to the most violent revolutionary leander'.
- Under these circumstances, it became my imper!Â­
tive duty to exert the whole constitutional power
I of the Executive to prevent the flames of civil war
from again raging in Kansas, which, in the exÂ­
3 cited state of the public mind, both North and
South, might have extended into the neighboring
States.
The hostile parties in Kansas had been sÂ­
flamed against each other by emissaries both
from the North and the South, to a degree 'I
malignity without a parallel in our lhistory. To
prevent actual collision, and to assist the civil
Sagistrates in enforcing the laws, a strong del
Stacltment of the army was stationed in the TerÂ­
r ritory, ready to aid the nmarshlal and his deputie
when lawfully called upon, as a posse coaniuat(a

Still, the troubles in Kansas could not havii
been permanently settled without an election l'c

of disputes among freemen. Underth:s col iV'

cons:idered a recognition on their part of the terÂ­
ritorial government established by Congress. A
better spirit, however, seemed soon after to preÂ­
vail, and the two parties met face to face at the
third election, held on the first Monday of JannuÂ­
ary. 1858, for members of the legislature and
State officers under the Lecompton constitution.
The result was the triumph of the anti-slavery
plarty at the polls. This decision of the ballotÂ­
box proved clearly that this part) were in the
majority, andt removed the danger of civil war.
From that time we have heard little or nothing
of the Topeka government: and all serious danÂ­
ger of revolutionary troubles in Kansas was then
at an end.
The Lecomnpton constitution, which had been
thus recognized at this Slate election by the votes
of both political parties in Kansas, was transÂ­
mitted to me with the request that I should proÂ­
'ent it to Congress. This I could not have reÂ­
fused to do without violating my clearest and
;trongest convictions of duty. The constitution,
and all the proceedings which preceded and folÂ­
lowed its formation, were fir and regular on
their thee. I then believed, and experience has
proved, that the interests of the people of Kansas
would have been best consulted by its admission
ats a State into the Union, especially as the maÂ­
jority, within a brief period, could have amended
the constitution according to their will and
pleasure. If fraud existed in all or any of these
proceedings, it was not for the President, but
for Congress, to investigate and determine the
question of fraud, and what ought to be its conÂ­
sequences. it, at the two first elections, the maÂ­
jority refused to vote, it cannot hbe pretended that
this refusal to exercise the elective franchise
could invalidate :i election fairly held under
lawful authority, even if they had not subseÂ­
quently voted at the third election. It is true
that the whole constitution had not been subÂ­
mitted to the people, as I always desired; but
the precedents are numerous of the admission of
States into the Union without such submission.
It would not comport with my present purÂ­
pose to review the proceedings of Congress upon
thie Lecompton constitution. It is sufficient to
observe that their final action has removed the
last \estige of serious revolutionary troubles.Â­
The desperate band recenltly assembled, under
a notorious outlaw, in the southern portion of
the Territory, to resist the execution of the laws
and to plunder peaceful citizens, will, I doubt
not, be speedily subdued and brought to justice.
Had I treated the Lecompton constitution as a
nullity and refused to transmit it to Congress, it
is not difficult to imagine, whilst recalling the
position of the country at that moment, what
would have been the disastrous consequences,
b, !th in and out of the Territory, from such a
dereliction of duty on the part of the Executive.
Peace has also been restored within the territory
of Utah, which, at the commencement of my
administration, was in a state of open rebellion.
This was the more dangerous, as the people, aniÂ­
mated by a fanatical spirit and entrenched within
their distant mountain fastnesses, might have
made a long and formidable resistance. Cost
what it might, it was necessary to bring them into
subjection to the constitution and the laws.Â­
Sound policy, therefore, as well as humanity, reÂ­
quired that this object should, if possible, be acÂ­
complished without the effusion of blood. This
could only be efbected by sending a military force
into the territory sufficiently strong to convince
the people that resistance would be hopeless, and 4
at the same time to offer them a pardon for past
oflences on condition of immediate submission to
the government. This policy was pursued with
eminent success; and the only cause for regret is
the heavy expenditure required to march a large
detachment of the army to that remote region and
to furnish it subsistence. Utah is now comparaÂ­
tively peaceful and quiet, and the military force
has been withdrawn, except that portion of it
necessary to keep the Indians in check and to proÂ­
tect the emigrantt trains on their way to our PaÂ­
cific possessions.
FINANCES.
In my first annual message I promised to employ
my hest exertions, in co-operation with Congress, to
reduce the expenditures of the Government within the
limits of a wise oand judicious economy. An overÂ­
flowing treasury had produced habits of prodigality
and extravagance which could only be gradually corÂ­
reeted. The work required both time and patience.
l applied myself diligently to this task from the beÂ­
ginning, and was aided by the able and energetic efÂ­
t'forts of the Heads of the different Executive DepartÂ­
ments. The result of our labors in this good cause
dlid not appear in the sum total of our expenditures
for the first two years, mainly in consequence of the
extraordinary expenditure necessarily incurred in the
Utah expedition, and the very large amount of the
contingent expenses of Congress during this period.
These greatly exceded the pay and mileage of the
members. Fortho year ending 30th June,1358,whilst
ithe pay and mileage amounted to $1,460,214; the conÂ­
tingent expenses rose to $2,093,309 79, and for the
year ending 30th June, 1859, whilst the pay and milÂ­
sage .tamounted to $S59,093. 66, the contingent expenÂ­
ses amounted to $1,431,565 78. I am happy, howÂ­
ever, to be aile to inform you that during the last fisÂ­
eal year ending on the 30th June, 1860, the total exÂ­
penditures of the Government in all its branchesÂ­
legislative, executive, and judicial-exclusive of the
public debt, were reduced to the sum of $55, 402,466Â­
16. This conclusively appears from the books of the
Treasury. In the year ending on the 80th June, 1858,
the total expenditure, exclusive of the public debt,
tnotunted to $71,901,129 77, and that for the year
ending 30th June, 1850, to $66,316,226 13. Whilst
the books of the Treasury show an actual expenditure
,f $59,8I8. 47i 72 for the year ending on the 30th
JuIne,l180, including $1,040,667 71 forthe contingent
expenses of Congreos,there must be deducted from this


amount too sum or Wt,z ua,uua "", witt toe interest
upon it of $1s0,000, appropriated by the act of 15th
February, 1860, ""far the purpose of supplying the deÂ­
ficiency in the revenues and defraying the expenses
of the Post Office Department for the year ending the
thirtieth of June, one thousand eight hundred and fifÂ­
ty-nine.'"" This sum, therefore, justly chargeable to
the year 1859, :, ust be deducted from thesum of $59,Â­
S4-8,-17 72, in order to ascertain the expenditure for
the year en(ling on the 30th June, 1860, which leaves
a: balance for the expenditures of that year of 55,402,Â­
.15 46. The interest on the public debt, including
Treasury notes for the same fiscal year ending on the
;:th June, 1860, amounted to $:,177,314 62, which,
added to the above sum of 55,402,465 40, makes the
aggregate of $58,579,7SO OS.
It ought in justice to be observed that several of the
estimates from the departments for the year ending
:10th June, 1860, were reduced by Congress below what
was and still is deemed compatible with the public inÂ­
terest. Allowing :tliheral!marginof 2,500,000 for this
reduction, and for other causes it may be safely asserÂ­
tad that the sum of $61,000,000, or at the most
-i2,,(000,00:1, is amply suficient to adminisÂ­
ter the Government and to pay the interest
,.n the public debt, unless contingent events should
hereafter render extraordinary expenditures necessary.
This result has been attained in a considerable doÂ­
gree by the care exercised by the appropriate depart.
mentrs in entering into public contracts. I have myÂ­
self never interfered with the, award of :ny such conÂ­
tract except in a single case with the Colonization SoÂ­
ciety, deemsing it advisible to cast the whole responsiÂ­
bility in each case on the proper head of the departÂ­
ment, with tLe general instruction that these conÂ­
tracts should always be given to the lowest and best
bidder. It has ever been my opinion that public conÂ­

It would be a useless repetition to do more than reÂ­
fer, with earnest commendation, to my former recomÂ­
mendations in favor of the Pacific railroad-of the
grant of power to the President to employ the naval
force in the vicinity, for the protection of the lives and
property of our fellow-citizens passing in transit over
the different CentralAmerican routes, against sudden
and lawless outbreaks and depredations; and also to
protect American merchant vessels, their crews and
cargoes, against violent and unlawful seizure and conÂ­
fiscation in the ports of Mexico and the South AmerÂ­
ican republics, when these may be in a disturbed and
revolutionary condition. It is my settled conviction,
that without such a power we do nos afford that proÂ­
tection to those engaged in the commerce of the
country which they have a right to demand.
ELE.CTION OF MIEwIBERS OF CONGRESS.
I again recommend to Congress the passage of a
law in pursuance of the provisions of the ConstituÂ­
tion, appointing a day certain, previous to the 4th of
March, in each year of an odd number, for the elecÂ­
tion of representatives throughout all the States.Â­
A similar power has already been exercised, with
general approbation, in the appointment of the same
dlay throughout the Union for holding the election of
electors for President and Vice President of the
United States. My attention was earnestly directed
to this subject from the fact, that the 35th Congress
terminated on the 3rd of March, 1S59, without makÂ­
ing the necessary appropriation for the service of the
Post Office Department. I was then forced to considÂ­
er the best remedy for this omission, and an immediÂ­
ate call of the present Congress was the natural reÂ­
sort. Upon enquiry, however, I ascertained that fifÂ­
teen out of the 33 States composing the Confederacy
were without representatives, and that, consequently,
these fifteen States would be disfranchised by such a
call. These fifteen States will be in tle same condiÂ­
tion on the 4th March next. Ten of them cannot
elect representatives, according to existing State
laws, until different periods, extending from the beÂ­
ginning of August next until the months of October
and November.
In my last message I gave warning that, in a time
of sudden and alarming danger, the salvation of our
institutions might depend upon the power of the
President immediately to assemble a full Congress, to
meet the emergency.
TARIFF.
It is now quite evident that the financial necessities
of the Government will require a modification of the
tariff during your present session, for the purpose of
increasing the revenue. In this aspect, I desire to
reiterate the recommendation contained in my last
two annual messages, in favor of imposing specific
instead of ad ralorent duties on all imported articles
to which these can be properly applied. From long
observation and experience I am convinced that speÂ­
cific duties are necessary, both to protect the revenue
and to secure to our manufacturing interests that
amount of incidental encouragement which unavoidÂ­
ably results from a revenue tariff.
As an abstract proposition it may be admitted that
ad calorent duties would, in theory, be the most just
and equal. But if the experience of this and all othÂ­
er commercial nations has demonstrated that such
duties cannot be assessed and collected without great
frauds upon the revenue, then it is the part of wisÂ­
dom to resort to specific duties. Indeed, from the
very nature of an ad valoremt duty, this must be the
result. Under it the inevitable consequence is, that
foreign goods will be entered at less than their true
value. The treasury will, therefore, lose the duty on
the difference between their real and fictitious value,
and to this extent we are defrauded.
The temptations which ad raloremt duties present
to a dishonest importer are irresistible. His object
is to pass his goods through the custom-house at the
very lowest valuation necessary to save them from
confiscation. In this he too often succeeds in spite
of the vigilance of the revenue officers. Hence the
resort to false invoices, one for the purchaser and anÂ­
other for the custom-house, and to other expedients
to defraud the Government. The honest importer
produces his invoice to the collector, stating the acÂ­
tue.l price at which he purchased the articles abroad.
Not so the dishonest importer and the agent of the
foreign manufacturer. And here it may be observed
that a:e very large proportion of the manufactures imÂ­
ported from abroad are consigned for sale to commisÂ­
sion merchants who are more agents employed by the
manufacturers. In such cases no actual sale has
been madtle to fix their valenc. The foreign manufacÂ­
turer, if he be dishonest, prepares an invoice of the
goods, not at their actual value, but at the very lowÂ­
est rate necessary to escape detection. In this manÂ­
ner the dishonest importer and the foreign manufacÂ­
turer enjoy a decided advantage over the honest merÂ­
chant. They are thus enabled to undersell the fair traÂ­
der, and drive him from the market. In fact, the
operation of this system has already driven from the
pursuits of honorable commerce many of that class
of regular and conscientious merchants, whose charÂ­
acter, throughout the world, is the pride of our counÂ­
try.
The remedy for these evils is to be found in specific
duties, so far as this may be practicable. They disÂ­
pense with any inquiry at the custom-house into the
actual cost or value of the article, and it pays the preÂ­
cise amount of duty previously fixed by law. They
present no temptations to the appraisers of foreign
goods, who receive but small salaries, and might, by
undervalue on in a few cases, render themselves inÂ­
dependant.
Besides, specific duties best conform to the requisiÂ­
tion in the Constitution that ""no preference shall be
given by any regulation of commerce or revenue to
the ports of one State over those of another."" Under
our ad valorest system such preferences are to some
extent inevitable, and complaints have often been
made that the spirit of this provision has been vioÂ­
lated by a lower appraisement of the same articles at
one port than 't another.
An impression strangely enough prevails to some
extent that specific duties are necessarily protective
duties. Nothing can be more fallacious. Great
Britain glories in free trade, and yet her whole reveÂ­
nue from imports is at the present moment collected
under a system of specific duties. It is a striking fact
in this connection that, in the commercial treaty of
23d January, 1860, between France and England, one
of the articles provides that the cd caloregs duties
Â·.-T,;.l. ;b ;n..c ..,llnll hrr ,cnx'nvÂ·nrl ;nta cnoÂ¢iâ‚¬* d,1_


ties within six months from its date, and these are to
be ascertained by making an average of the prices for
six months previous to that time. The reverse of the
proposition would be nearer to the truth, because a
much larger amount of revenue would be collected by
merely converting the ad valorens duties of a tariff
into equivalent specific duties. To this extent the
revenue would be increased, and in the same proporÂ­
tion the specific duty might be diminished.
Specific duties would secure to the American manÂ­
ufacturer the incidental protection to which he is
fairly entitled under a revenue tariff, and to this sureÂ­
ly no person would object. The framers of the exisÂ­
ting tariff have gone further, and in a liberal spirit
have discriminated in favor of large and useful
branches of our manufactures, not by raising the rate
of duty upon the importation of similar articles from
abroad, but what is the same in effect, by admitting
articles free of duty which enter into the composition
of their fabrics.
Under the present system it has been often truly
remarked that this incidental protection decreases
when the manufacturer needs it most, and increases
when he needs it least, and constitutes a sliding scale
which always operates against him. The revenues of
the country are subject to similar fluctuation. InÂ­
stead of approaching a steady standard, as would be
the case under a system of specific duties, they sink
and rise with the sinking and rising prices of articles
in foreign countries. It would not be difficult for
Congress to arrange a system of specific duties which
would atford additional stability both to our revenue
and our manufactures, and without injury or injustice
to any interest of the country. This might be accomÂ­
plished by ascertaining the average value of any givÂ­
en article for a series of years at the place of exportaÂ­
tion, and by simply converting the rate of ad sdlorcm
duty upon it which might be deemed necessary for
revenue purposes, into the form of a specific duty.Â­
Such an arrangement could not injure the consumer.
If he should pay a greater amount of duty one year,
this would be counterbalanced by a lesser amount
the next, and in the end the aggregate would ie the
samue.
L desire to call your immediate attention to the
present condition o tihe Treasury, so ably and clearly
presented by the Secretary in his report to Congress;
and to recommend, that measures be promptly adoptÂ­
ed, to enable it to discharge its pressing obligations""
Tihe other recommendations of the report are 'well
worthy of your favorable consideration.
I herewith transmit to Congress the reports of the
Secretaries of War, of the Navy, of the Interior and
of the Postmaster General. The recommendations
and suggestions which they contain are highly valÂ­
uable and deserve your careful attention.
The report of the Postmast er General details the
circumstances under which Cornelius Vanderbilt, on
my request, agreed, in the month of July last, to carÂ­
ry the ocean mails between our Atlantio mind Pacific




 coasts. Had he not thus acted, this important interÂ­
communication must have been suspended, at least
for a season. The Postmaster General had no power
to make hint any other compensation than the postÂ­
ages on the mail matter which he might carry. It
was known, at the time, that these postages would
fall far short of an adequate compensation, as well as
of the sum which the same service had previously
cost the Government. Mr. Vanderbilt, in a commendÂ­
able spirit, was willing to rely upon the justice of
Congress to make up the deficiency; and I, therefore,
recommend that an appropriation may be granted for
this purpose.
I should do great injustice to the Attorney GeneÂ­
ral, were I to omit the mention of his distinguished
services in the measures adopted and prosecuted by
him for the defence of the Government against nuÂ­
merous and unfounded claims to land in California,
purporting to have been made by the Mexican govÂ­
ernment previous to the treaty of cession. The sucÂ­
cessful opposition to these claims has saved to the
United States public property worth many millions
of dollars, and to individuals holding title under
them to at least an equal amount.
It has been represented to me, from sources which
I deem reliable, that the inhabitants in several porÂ­
tions of Kansas have been reduced nearly to a state of
starvation. on account of the almost total failure of
their '1st the harvests in every other portion
of ave been abundant. The prospect
b eto approachfng winter is well calcuÂ­
e sympathies of every heart. The
rs to be so general that it cannot he
ree 'ate contributions, and they are in
sue circumstances as to be unable to purÂ­
chase tie necessaries of lifh for themselves, I refer
the subject to Congress. If any constitutional measÂ­
ure for their relief can he devised I would recommend
its adoption.
I cordially commend to your favorahle regard the
interests of the people of this District. They are
eminently entitled to your consideration, especially
.since, unlike the people of the States, they can appeai
to no Government except that of the Union.

I again urge a change in the federal judicial
system to meet the wants of the people and obviÂ­
ate the delays necessarily attending the present
condition of affairs in our courts. All are agreed
that something should be done, and much favor
is shown by those well able to advise, to the plan
suggested by the attorney-general at the last sesÂ­
sion of congress, and recommended in my last anÂ­
nual message. This recommendation is here re.
newed, together with another made at the same

pensating district attorneys and marshals; and the
latter subject is commended to congress for its
action in the interest of economy to the governÂ­

THIE INDIANS.
The report of the secretary of the interior preÂ­
sents a comprehensive summary of the work ot the
various branches of the public service connected
with his department,'and the suggestions and
recommendations which it contains for the imÂ­
provement of the service should receive your careÂ­
ful consideration. The exhibit made of the coitliÂ­
tion of our Indian population rind progress of
work for their enlightenment, notwihustatding
the many embarassments which hinder better adÂ­
ministration of this important branch of the serÂ­
vice, is a gratifying and hopeful one. The funds
appropriated for the Indian service for the fiscal
year Just passed, with the available income
from Indian land and trust moneys, amointÂ­
ing in all to $7,850,775.12, were ample for
the service under the conditions and reÂ­
strictions of laws regulating their expend.
iture. There remained a balance on hand June
80, 1886, of $1,760,023.30, of which $1.336,768.21 are
permanent funds for the fulfillment of treaties
and other like purposes, and the remainder, S:;22,Â­
255.09, is subject to be carried to the surplus funld
as required by law. The estimates presented for1
appropriations for the ensuing fiscal year amount
to 85,618,873.64, or $4.12,386.24 less than those laid 1
before congress last year.
The present system of aeencies, while absolutely
necessary and well adapted for tihe inmanagement of
our Indian affairs, and for the ends in view, when
it was adopted, is in the present state of Indian
management inadequate, st n lihng alonle for the
accomplishment of an object which has becolane
pressing in its importance-the more raid transiÂ­ 1
tion from tribal organizations to ci i :,nship ofi
such portions of the Indians as are ituluapatble of
civilized life. When the existing system was
adopted the Indiua race was outside of the limits
of organized states and terrltories, and beyond the it
immediate reach and operation o1 eivilization, and
all efforts were mainly directed to the maintennnce
of frienidly relations and the preservation of peace
and quiet on the frontier.
All this is niow clanged. There is no such thing
as the Indian frontitr. Civilization withll the busy
hum ofindustry and the influence of Christianity
surrounds these people at every point. foue of
the tribes are outside of the bounds of organized
government and society, except that the territoÂ­
rial system has not been extended over that porÂ­
tion of the country known as the Indian terriÂ­
tory. As a race the Indians are nto longer hostile,
but may be considered as submtissive to the control


or in government, as few of them only are o
troublesome. Except the fragments of several e
bands, all are now gathered upon reservations. It e
is no longer possible for them to subsist by the
chase and the spontaneous productions of the
earth. With an abunclance of land, if furnished (
with the means and implements for profitable busÂ­
bandry, their life of entire dependence upon the t
government rations from day to day is no longer
defensible. Their inclination, long fostered by a
defective system of control, is to cling to habits
and customs of their ancestors, and struggle with
persistence-against the changes of lie which their
altered circumstances press upon ti.e n.
But barbarism and civilization cannot live to.
gether. It is Impossible that such incongruous t
conditions should co-exist on the same soil. They
are a portion of our people, are under the authoriÂ­ j
ty of our government, and have a peculiar claim B
on and are entitled to the fostering care and proÂ­
tection of the nation. The government cannot reÂ­ t
lieve itself of this responsibility till they are so c
far trained and civilized as to be able wholly to c
manage and care for themselves. The path in t
which they should walk must be clearly marked
out for them, and they must be led or guided till
they are familiar with the way and are competent r
to assume the duties and responsibilities of our
citizenship. Progress in this great work will f
continue only at the present slow pace and at
great expense, unless the system and methods
of management are improved to meet the crhangÂ­
ed conditions and urgent demands of the service. t
The agents having general charge and supervision l
in many c: ses of more than 5,000 Indians scattered t
over large reservations, and burden.d with-the deÂ­ t
tails of accountability for funds and supplies, t
have time to look after the industrial training and
improvement of a few Indians only. The many t
are neglected and remain idle and in dependent c
conditions not favolable for progressive civilizaÂ­
tion. The compensation allowed these agents and c
conditions of service are not calculated to secure
for the workmen who are fitted by ability and skill x
to properly plan and intelligently direct the methÂ­
ods best adapted to produce the most speedy results c
and permanent benefits. Hence the necessity for t
a supplementary agency or system directed to the
end of promoting the general ana more rapid tranÂ­
sition of tribes from habits and customs of barbar. c
ism to the ways of civilization.
A PROPOSED COMMISSION. I
With an anxious desire to devise some plan of r
operation with which to secure the welfare of the s
Indians and to relieve the treasury as far as possi. c
ble from the support of an idle and dependent a
population, I recommended in my previous annuÂ­ c
al message the passage of a law authorizing the 1
appointment of a commission as an instrumentali. c
ty auxiliary to those already established for the t
care of the Indlams. It was designed that this n
committee commission should be composed of six a
intelligent and capable civilians, and three to be e
detailed from the army having practical ideas k
upon the subject of the treatment of Indians and g
interested in their welfilre, and that it c
should be charged, under the direction of the r
secretary of the interior, with the management of g
such matters of detail as cannot with the present ji
organization be properly and cucceestully conÂ­ f
ducted, and which present different phases as the v
Indians themselves differ in their progress, needs, I
disposition, and capacity for imp:ovement or imÂ­ n
mediate self-support. By the aid of such a comÂ­ o
mission much unwise and useless expenditure of s
money, and waste of materials and unavailing p
efforts.might be avoidtd and it is hoped that this o
or some measures which the wisdom of congress t
may better devise to supply the deficiency of the t
present system may receive your consideration s
and the appropriate legislation be provided.
The time is ripe for the work of suc(h an agency. I
There is less opposition to the education and trainÂ­ ti
ing of the Indian youth, as shown by the increased p
attendance upon the schools, and there is a yieldÂ­ a
ing tendency for the individual holding of lands. a;
Development and advancement in these directions c
are essential and should have every encourageÂ­ u
ment. As the rising generation are taught the I
language of civilization and trained in habits of o
industry they should assume the duties, privileges t]
and responsibility of citizenship. No obstacles a:
should hinder the location and settlement of any u
Indian willing to take land in severalty. On the c
contrary, the inclination to do so should be stimuÂ­ c.
lated at all times when proper and expedient. a
Bu; there is no authority of law for making s,
allotments on some of the reservations, and on ti
others the allotments provided for are so small a
that the Indians, though needy and desiring si
to settle down, are not willing to accept ii
such small areas. When their reservations conÂ­ it
fain ample lands to afford them homesteads of o
sufficient size to meet their present and future v
needs, these inequalities of existing special laws tl
and treaties, should be corrected and some genÂ­ a:
eral legislation on the subject should be provided at
so that the more progressive members of the differÂ­ ti
ent tribes may be settled upon homesteads, and by a
their example teach others to follow, breaking al
away from tribal customs and substituting thereÂ­ ti
for the love of home, the interest of the family al
and the rule of the state. The Indian character it
and nature are such that they are not easily lead tl
while brooding over unadjusted wrongs. This is w
especially so regarding their lands. W
Matters arking from the construction and op*. U

 eration oferailroads across some. of the reservaÂ­
tions, and claims of title indt right of occupancy
set up by white-persons to omne of the best land
within other reservations, reqluire legislation for
their final adjustment. The settlement of these
matters will remove matayembarrassments to
progress in the work of lÂ£adsi g the Indians to
as the adoption of our instiitttons and bringing
them under the operationstble;-linfluence and the
protection of the universallaWs of our country.
TIHE PUBLIC; DO~lIN,.
- The recommendations ofl~he secretary of the inÂ­
' terior and the commissioner oi the general landÂ­
oftice, looking to the bettet.:lirotection of public
lands and the public survoesrlthe preservation of
or national forests, the adjudication of grants to
rt states and corporations andof private. land claims,
sit and the increased efflicieneryof the public lane
nÂ­ service, are commended to,:the attention of conÂ­
eÂ­ gress. To secure the widest distribution of public
to lands in limited quantities among settlers of resiÂ­
1Â­ dence and cultivation, and thUS make the greatest
he
number of individual homes, was the primary obÂ­
ed ject of the public land legislation in the early
he days of the republic. Thisisrystem was a simple
ir.
one. It commenced with an admirable scheme of
id public surveys, by which the humblest citizen
0. could identify the tract upon which he wished to
re establish his home. The price of lands was placed
wÂ­ within the reach of all the enterprising, indus.
e
trious and honest pioneer citizens of the country.
of It was soon, however, found that the object of the
eÂ­ laws was perverted under the system of cash sales
nÂ­ from a distribution of land among the people to
it
an accumulation of land capital by wealthy and
rÂ­ speculative persons. To check this tendency a
id
preference right of purchase was given to settlers
ut on the land, a plan which culminated in the genÂ­
e eral preimption act of 1841, The foundation of
e this system was actual residence and cultivation,
tÂ­
Twenty years later the homestead law was deÂ­
st vised to more surely place actual homes in the
n.
ossession of actual cultivators of the soil. The
n, land was given without price, the sole condition
rÂ­ being residence, improvement and cultivation.
Id
Other laws have followed, each designed to enÂ­
te courage the acquirement and use of laud in
in linited individual quantities. But in later years
ts these laws, througl vicious administrative
is methods, and under changed conditions of com.
Id munication and transportation, have been so
ct
evaded and violated that their beneficent purpose
cÂ­
is threatened with entire defeat. The methods of
h such evasions and violations we set forth in detail
ig
in the reports of the secrtt'ry of the interior
iÂ­ and commissioner of the general land ofÂ­
iÂ­ lice. The rapid appropriation of our pubÂ­
is lie land without eona fide settlements or
e cultivation and not without intention of residence
es
but for the purpose of their aggregation in large
iÂ­ holdings, in many cases in the hands of foreignÂ­
- ers, invites the serious and immediate attention of
it
congress. The energies of the land department
e have been devoted during the present aaministraÂ­
g tion to remedy defects and correct abuses in the
e public land service. The results of these efforts
;e
are so largely in the nature of reforms in the
methods of our land system as to prevent adequate
estimates; but it appears by a compilation from
the reports of the commissioner, of the general
1 land oflice that the immediate effect in leading
iÂ­
cases which have conic to a final termination has
it
been the restoration to the ""mass of public lands
d of 2,710,000 acres; that 2,370,000 acres are embraced
r in investigations now pending before the departÂ­
ii ment or the courts, and that action of conÂ­
t. gress has been asked to effect the restoration
- of 2,790,000 acres additional, besides which
4,000,000 acres have been withheld from reservaÂ­
e tion and the rights of entry thereon maintained.
iI
recommend the :repeal of the preemption and
e timber culture acts, and that thehomestead laws
s beso amended so as to better secure compliance
with and cultivation for theperiod of five years
r from date of entry, without commnutation or proÂ­
vision for speculative relinquisihment. I also recÂ­
ommend repeal of the desert land laws, unless it
shall be the pleasure of congress to so amend these
e
laws as to render them less liable to abuse. As the
chief motive for the evasion of the laws
and the principal cause of their result
of land accumulation instead of land
distribution is the facility with which
transfers are suede in the right intended to be sc.
cured to settlers, it may be deemed advisable to
provide by legislation some guards and checks up.
on the alienation of vested rights and landscov.Â­
ered thereby until patents issue.
ILLEGAL FENCING.
I Last year an executive proclamation was issued
a
directing the removal of fences which inclosed
the public domain. Many of these have been reÂ­
moved in obedience to such order, but much of C
the public land still remains within the lines of (
these unlawful fences. The -ingenious methods
resorted to in order to continue these trespasses
and the hardihood of the pretenses by which, in
some cases, such inclosures are justified are fully
detailed in the report of the secretary of the inÂ­ C
terior. The removal of the fences still remaining,
r which enclose public lands, will be enforced with
all the authority and means with which the execuÂ­
tive branch of the government is or shall be inuÂ­
vested by the congress for that purpose.
PENSIONS.
f
The report of the commissioner of pensions conÂ­
tains a detailed and most satisfactory exhibit of
the operations of the pension bureau. During the
last fiscal year the amount of work done was the
largest in any year since the organization of the
bureau; and it ha:s been done at less cost than durÂ­
ing the previous year in every division. On the
f
i0th day of June, 1886, there were 365,783 pension.
cers on the rolls of the bureau. Since 1861 there
have been 1.108,735 applications for pensions filed;:
of.which 78, 34 were based:uipon ser\vice in tile
war of 18t2.. There were. 62-1,75t.-of the:se applica:
toins allowed including 60,170Â­ to the soldiers of
1812 land their widows. The total amount paid for
pensionssince 1b81 is i)$8,62-1,811.57. The number
of new pensions allowed during the year
ended Jute 30, 1886, is 40,357, a larger
number than has been allowed in aiy year
save one since 1861i; the lilmes of 2,229 pensionecrs
which hiave been previously dropped from tihe t
rolls were restored di'ing the year, anud after
deducting those dropped witihin the same time
for various caullses a net increase remains for tihe
year ot 21,658 names. From Jan. 1, 1861, to Dec.
S1: 1885. 1,967 private pension acts had been enased:


snce S e Iast mentioned date and during the last r
session of congress, 661I such acts became law. It
seems to me that no one can examine our pension
establishment and its operations without being t
convinced that through its instrumentality justice
can be very nearly done to all who are entitled,
under the present laws, to the pension bounty of
the government. But it is undeniable that
cases exist well entitled to relief in which o
the pension bureau is powerless to relieve the P
really worthy c:;ses. Of this class are such as only '
lack by misfortune the kind ad quantity of proof a
which the law and regulations of the bureau reÂ­ v
quire, or which, though their merit is apparent f
for some other reason, cannot. be justly dealt with
through general laws. These conditions fully a
justily the appiication to the congress and special 1
enactments, but resort to the congress for a t
special pension act to overrule the deliberate and ti
careful determination of the pension bureau on o
the merits or to secure favorable action when it tl
could not be expected under the most libefal exeÂ­ a
cution of general laws, it must be admitted, opens T
the door to the allowance of questionable claims at
and presents to the legislative and executive ti
branches of the government applications clearly tl
not within the latv and plainly devoid of merit, t
but so surrounded by sentiment and patriotic tl
feeling that they are hard to resist. I u
suppose it will not be denied that many claims for W
pension are made without merit and that many c
have been allowed upon fraudulent representaÂ­ \""
tions. This has been declared from the pension o
bureau, not only in this but in prior administraÂ­ b
tions. The usefulness and the justice of any sys. 1
temn for the distribution of pIensions depend upon I1
the equality and unilonnity of its olperation. It P
will be seen from the report of the commissioner tl
that they are now paid by the government 151 t1
different rates of pension, 1.
lie estimates from the best information he can ct
obtain that 9,000 of those who have served in the 51
army and navy of the United States are now supÂ­ P
ported, in whole or in part, from public funds, or
by organized charities, exclusive of those in solÂ­ tl
diers' homes under the direction and control of I
the government. Only 13 per cent. of these are g
pensioners, while of the entire number of men o
furnished for the late war, something like 20 per si
cent., including their widows and relatives, have el
been or now are in the receipt of pensions. The a
American people, witll a patriotic and grateful n
regard for our ex-soldiers, too broad ano too u
sacred to be monopolized by any special advoÂ­
cates, are not only willing, but anxious that equal
and exact justice should be' done to all honest P
claimants for pensions. In their sight the friendÂ­ P
less and destitute soldier dependent on public f
charity, if otherwise entitled, has precisely ti
the same right to share in the provision o'
made for those who fought their country s battles it
as !hose better able, through friends and influÂ­ Wi
ence, to push their claims. Every pension that is ce
granted under our present plan upon any other U
grounds than actual
: ervice, injury or disease inÂ­ Sc
curred in such service, and evary instance of the 81
many in which pensions ai'e Increased on other ea
grounds than the merits of, tt'`laim, work an inÂ­ u
justice to the brave and
c d, but poor and tl
friendless soldier, who is s.llhliy neglected, or
who must be content with T'e'""smallest sum alÂ­ o0
lowed under geo e;al laws. '""c
'are far too iany at
neighborhoods in which aMl-o find glaring cases bh
of inequality of treatment ifma he matter of penÂ­ at
stons, and they are largely di e to a yielding in the bh
pension bureau to impor tuinj ietOn the part ofthese tt
other than the pensioners who aiIre especially inÂ­ st
terested as they arise from Ijil acts passed for lI
the benefit of individuals. mhe men who fought at
side by side should stand sirlebvy side when they sl
participate in a grateful t'i oi's Mkind rememÂ­ of
brance. Evdey consideratioi6 'f jfairness and jnsÂ­ hi
tice to our ex-soldiers and ""the protection of the ec
patriotic instincts of our citizeths irom perversion
and violence point to the adoption of a pension
system broad and comprohpqjsive enough to bi
cover every contingency a'lid, ywhich shall make o:
unnecessary an objectionab
,
1piolation of special 1
legislation. As long as we ailhci'e to the principle hi
of granting pensions for service and disability as gi
the result of the service, the-walpwance of pensions to
should be restricted to caseL preserting these featÂ­ ki
ures. Every patriotic heart responds to a tender at
consider;.t:on for those who, having served their la
country long and well, are reduced to destitution in
and dependence, not as an incident of their as
service, but with advancing age, or nt
through sickness or misfortune. We are' le
all tempted by the contemplation of be
such a condition to supply relief, and are often bi
impatient of the limitations of public duty. YieldÂ­ pi
ing to no one in the desire to indulge this feeling m
of consideration, I cannot rid myself of the conÂ­ W
viction that if these ex-soldiers are to be relieved, -cc
they and their cause are entitled to the benefit of re
an enactment under which relief may be claimed. at
as a right, and such relief should be granted under an
the sanction of law, not in the violation of it; so
nor should such worthy oujects. of care, of
all equally entitled, be remitted to unequal operaÂ­ th
tion of sympathy or the tender mercies of social be
and political influence, with their unjust discrimÂ­ lit
inations. The discharged soldiers and sailors of pc
the country are our fellow-citizens and interested to
with us in the passage and'faithful execution of se
wholesome law. They cannot be swerved from oe
their duty or citizenship by artful appeals to their ra


aÂ­ spirit of brotherhood born of common peril and
cy
suffering, nor will they exact as a test of devotion
ad to their welfare a willingness to neglect public
or duty in their behalf, -
'sB
THI PATENT OFFICE,'
to On the 4th ofÂ­ March, 1885, the current business
to of the patent office was on an average five and a
g half months behind. At the close of the last fiscal
e year such current, work was but three months in
arrears, and it is asserted and believed that i:n the
next few months the delay in obtaining an examÂ­
aÂ­
ination bf an application for a patent will be but
dÂ­
nominal. The number of applications for patents
ic for the last fiscal year, including reissues, designs,
of trade marks and labels, equals 40,678, which is conÂ­
to sideraply in excess of the number received during
s, the preceding year. The receipts of the patent ofÂ­
Sfleco during the year aggregated $12,516,780,
aÂ­
enabling the office to turn into the treasury
ic over and above all expenditures of about $168,Â­
tiÂ­
701.73. The number of patents granted during the
st last fiscal year, including reissues, trade marks,
bÂ­
designs and labels, was 25,619, t'number also quite
ly largely in excess of that of any preceding year.
le The report of the commissioner shows the office to
f be in a prosperous condition and constantly inÂ­
n creasing in its business. No increase of force is
to
asked for. The amount estimated for ih3 fiscal
d year ending June 30, 1886, was $890,760. The
sÂ­ amount estimated for the year ending June 80,
y.
1885, was $853,90.
le THE PACIFIC ROADS.
es The secretary of the interior suggests a change
to
in the plan for the payment of the indebtedness of
Id the Pacific subsidized roads to the government.
a His suggestion has the unanimous endorsement of
rs
the persons selected by the government to act as
nÂ­
directors of those roads and protect the interests of
if
the United States in the board of direction. In
n,
considering the plan proposed, the sole matters
aÂ­
which should be taken into account, in my opinÂ­
ie ion, are the situation of the government as a credÂ­
ie itor and the surest way to secure the payment of
n the principal and interest of its debt. By a recent
. decision of the supreme court of the United States
- it has been adjudged that the laws of the several
n states are inoperative to regulate rates of transÂ­
.s portation upon railroads, if such regulation interÂ­
'e
feres with the rate of carriage from one state into
- another. This important field ofcontrol and regÂ­
uo lation having been thus left entirely unoccupied
e the expediency of federal action upon the subject
if s worthy of consideration.
1 LABOtR MATTERS.
r The relations of labor to capital and of laboring
.Â­ men to their employers are of the utmost concern
to every patriotic citizen. When these are strained
r and distorted unjustifiable claims are apt to be inÂ­
e sisted upon by both interests, and in the contro.
e versy which results, the welfare of all and the
iÂ­
prosperity of the country are jeopardized. Any
if intervention of the general government within the
t limits of its constitutional authority to avert such
a condition should be willingly accorded. In i
e a special. message transmitted to the conÂ­
s gress at its last session I suggested the
a enlargement of our present labor bureau and addÂ­
e lug to its present functions the power of arbitraÂ­
n tion in cases where differences arise between emÂ­
.1
ployds and employers. When these differences
g
reach such a stage as to result in the interruption
s of commerce between the states, the ipplication of
s this remedy by the general government might be I
regarded as entirely within its constitutionil powÂ­
ers and, I think. We might reasonably hope that
such arbitrators, if carefully selected and if entiÂ­
tled to the confidence of the parties to be
ti
affected, would be voluntarily called to the
settlement of controversies of less extent
and not necessarily within the domain of
I federal regulation. I am of the opinion
s that this suggestion is worthy the attention of I
e
congress, but after all has been done by the pasÂ­ t
s
sage of laws, either federal or state, to relieve a sitÂ­
uation hull of solicitude, much more remains to be
accomplished by the reinstatement and cultivaÂ­
tion of a true American sentiment, which recogÂ­
o
nizes the equality of American citizenship. This
e
in the light of our traditions and in loyalty to the
spirit of our institutions, would teach that a
hearty cooperation on the part of all interests is e
the surest path of national greatness c
Sand the happiness of all our pcople;
that capital should in recognition of
the brotherhood of our citizenship and in a spirit
of American fairness generously accord to labor A
its just compensation and consideration and that
contented labor Is capital's best protection and
faithful ally. It would teach, too, that the diverse
situations of our people are inseparable from our
civilization; that every citizen should, in his
sphere, be a contributor to the general good; that
f capital does not necessarily tend to the oppression
f
of labor, and that violent disturbances and disÂ­
orders alienate from their promoters true AmeriÂ­
can sympathy and kindly feeling.
DEPARTMENT OF AGR.ICULTURE,
The department of agriculture, representing the
oldest and largest of our national industries, is C
subserving well the purr.oses of its organization.
By the introduction of new subjects of farming
enterprise, and by opening new sources of agriÂ­
cultural wealth and the dissemination of early inÂ­
formation concerning production and prices, it has
contributed largely to the country's prosperity.
Through this agency advanced thought
and investigation, touching the subjects
it has in charge, should, among other things,
be practically appliae to home production, at a
low cost, of articles of food which are now imÂ­
ported from abroad. Such an' innovation will
necessarily of course in the beginning, be within
the domain of intelligent experiments and the
subject in every stage should receive all possible
encouragement from the government. The interÂ­
ests of millions of our citizen engaged in agriculÂ­
ture are involved in on'enlargement and improveÂ­
mentof the results of their labor; anda zealous
regard for their welfatre should be a willing
tribute to those whose productive returns are a
main source of our progress and nower. The
existence of pleuro-pucneumonia among the
cattle of various states has led to burdenÂ­
somen, and in some cases, disastrous restricÂ­
tions in an important branch of our
comloerce, threatening to affect the quantity
and quality of our mood supply. This is a matter
of suich importance nid of such far-reaching conÂ­
sequences that I hope it will engage the serious -
attenlion of congress to the end that such a remedy T
manr be aDlnd t ne tha l imitn nf n mno,-, t ot....


delegatioin of power to the general government
will permit. I commend to the consideration of
the congress the report of the commissloner and
his suggestions concerning the interests intrusted
to his care.
CIVIL SERVICE REFORDIf.
The continued operation of the law relating to
our civil service has added to the most convincing p
proofs of its necessity and usefulness. It is a faect
worthy of note that ci'ery public oflicer, who has
a just idea of his duty to the people, testifies to the
value of this reform. Its staunchest friends are
found among those who understand it best, and
its warmest supporters are those who are restrained
and protected by its requirements. The
meaning of such restraint and protecÂ­
tion is not appreciated by those who
want places under the government, regardless
of merit and eflicicncy, nor by those who insist
that the selection for such places should rest upon
a proper credential showing active partisan work.
They mean to public officers the only opportunity
affobrded them to attend to public business and
they mean to the good people of the country
the better performance of the work of
their government. It is exceedingly strange t
the scope and nature of this reform are so little
understood, and that so many things not included
within its plan are called by its name. When civil
cavil yields more fully to examination, the system
will have large additions to the number
of its friends. Our civil-service reform may
be imperfect in some of its details.
It may be misunderstood and opposed.
It may not always be faithfull3 apÂ­
plied. Its designs may sometimes miscarry
through mistake or will fail. It may sometimes
tremble under the assaults of its enemies or
languish under the misguided zeal of impractiÂ­
cable friends. If the people of thiscountry ever
submit to the banishment of its underlying
principle from the operation of their govern.
ment, they willabandon the surest guarantee of
the safety and success of American institutions.
I invoke for this reform the cheerful and unÂ­
grudging support of congress. I renew my recÂ­
ommendation made last year that the commis.
sioners be made equal to other offices of the govÂ­
ernment having like duties and responsibilities,
and I hope that such reasonable appropriations
may be made as will enable them to increase the
usefulness of the cause they have charge of.
TIIE FREEDM EN'S SAVING IBANIC
I desire to call the attention of congress to a
plain duty which the government owes to the deÂ­
positors in Freedman Savings and Trust company,
This company was chartered by the congress for
the benetir of the most illiterate and humble of
our people and with the intention of encouraging
in them industry and thrift. Most of its branches
were presided over by officers holding the
commissions and clothed in the uniform of the
United States. These and other circumstances
seasonably, I think, led these simple people to
suppose that the invitation to deposit their hard
earned savings in this institution implied an
undertaking on the part of their government that
their money should be safely kept for them.
When this company thiled it was liable in the sum
of 82,939,925, to 61,131 depositors, Dividends
amountiig to the aggregate of 62 per cent. have
been declared and the sum called for
and paid of such dividends seems to
be 81,648,181.72. This sum, deducted from
the entire amount of deposits leaves $1,291,744.50 h
still unpaid. Past exp rcluce has shown quite a k
large ptrt of this sum will not be called for. There b
are assets still on hand amountil g to the estimated
sum of ,16,000. I think the remaining 38 per cent.
of such as these deposits as have claimants'should.
be paid by tile government upon principles . of
equity and fairness.
TIIE DISTRICT OF COLUMIBIA.
The report of the commissioner, soon to be laid
before congress, will give more satisfac:ory details
oR: this subject. The control of the afliirs of the
District of Columbia having been placed in the
hands of purely executive officers, while the conÂ­
gress still retains all legislaitive authority relating
to its government, it becomes my duty to make
known the most pressing needs of the district
and recommend their considtr.ation. The
laws of the district appear to be
in an uncertain and unsatisfactory condition,
and their codification or revision is much ins
needed. During the past year one of the bridges El
leading from the district to the state of Virginia
became unfit for use, and travel on it was forÂ­
bidden. This leads me to suggest that the imÂ­
provement of all bridges crossing the PotoÂ­
mac and its branches from the city of
Washington is worthy of the attention of
-congress. The commissioners of the District rep.
resent that the laws regulating the sale of liquor
and granting licenses therefor should be at once
amendei, and that legislation is needed to conÂ­
solidate, define and enlarge the scope and powers
of charitable and peual institutions within
the district. I sitggest that the commissioners
be clothed with the power to make, within fixed
limitations, police regulations. I believe this'
power, granted and carefully guarded, would tend
to subsere the good order of the municipality. It
seems that trouble still exists growing out of the
occupation of the streets and avenues, by certain
railroads having their termini in the city. It Is




 very important that such laws should
be enacted upon.. this subject as will
secure to the railroads all the facilities
they require for 'the transaction of theft business
and at the same time protect citizens from injury
to their :persons or property. The commissioners
again complain that accommodations afforded
them for necessary offices for district
busihess and for the safe-keeping ' of
books and papers are entirely ineficientÂ­
I recommend that this condition of affairs to be
remediec by congress, and suitable quarters be
furnished for the needs of the District governÂ­
ment.
In conclusion, I earnestly invoke such iise
action on the part of the people's legislators as
will subserve the public good and demonstrate,
during the remaining days of the congress as at
present organized, its ability and inclination to so
meet the peolle's need that itlshall be gratefully
remembered by an expectant constituency.Â­
Washington, Dec. 6. GROVER CLGVEIAND","unknown"
"686","6770260","CABINET,

Mr. Cleveland Officially AnÂ­
nounces the Names of
Four Members.

Walter Q. Gresham, of Illinois,
to Be Secretary of
State.

There Is No Need of Any MysÂ­
tery Regarding the
Cabinet.

Other Names Will Be AnÂ­
nounced as Soon as
Selected.

Lakewood, Feb. 14.â€”Mr. Cleveland
officially announced the names of four
members of his cabinet through the AsÂ­
sociated Press this evening. They are:

WALTER Q. GRESHAM, of Illinois,
secretary of state.

JOHN G. CARLISLE, of Kentucky,
secretary of the treasury.
WILSON S. BISSELL, of Buffalo,
postmaster general.

DANIEL S. LAMONT, of New York,
secretary of war.

On making the announcements, Mr.
Cleveland said:

""There is no need of any mystery in
regard to the cabinet, and it is useless
to speculate and indulge in guess work.
] shall make no secret of the matter.but
announce the names of the gentlemen
selected to fill the positions as fast as I
receive their acceptances and permisÂ­
sion to make the matter public.""

Mr. Cleveland would say nothing in
regard to the other positions of the men
who have been mentioned in connection
with them. It is evident that Hoke
Smith, Hilary A. Herbert, and others
who have been mentioned, are still
under consideration. A conference,
which will probably settle Mr.
Smith's chances one way or the other,
will be held at Mr. Cleveland's office in
New York some day this week. Senator
Gordon and other Southerners will be
present. Mr. Cleveland

lÂ»oes Not Care to Say
what day he will visit the city, as he
desires to meet only the men who have
an appointment with him, and thus be
able to dispose of important matters
without Interruption.

Mr. Cleveland had a social visit from
Mr. Cadwallader, of Philadelphia, toÂ­
day. This is Mr. Cadwallader's second
visit inside of a week; he is supposed
to have an interest in the selection of a
Philadelphian, whose name he careÂ­
fully guards from the public. SenaÂ­
tor John Martin, of Kansas, and
Dr. S. J. Neely, of the same
state, had a long talk with Mr. CleveÂ­
land today. They put in a strong claim
for a representation in the cabinet from
Kansas. Senator Martin is the lirst DemÂ­
ocratic senator ever sent to Washington
from his state. He urged the selection
of ex-Gov. J. W. Glick, and left LakeÂ­
wood in a happy frame of mind as to the
chances of his candidate. He said that
Mr. Cleveland informed him that Judge
Gresham had not been selected to temÂ­
porarily fill the place of secretary of
6tate until Minister E. J. Phelps finishes
with the Behrintr sea controversy, but
had been selected for good.

Connecticut's Representative.

Haktpord,Conn., Feb. 14.â€”A Times
Washington special says that it is stated
then? that the secretaryship of the navy
is to go to Connecticut, and that ex-
Congressman French, of Seymour, is to
be a member of Mr. Cleveland's official
family. The report gives satisfaction.
The Connecticut contingent here, the
dispatch fays, and all classes who know
Mr. French, express tnemselves as
liuhly pleased over the prospect of his
entry into the cabinet","unknown"
